## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
Domestic Rhodium output in the US and its allies is essentially negligible.  The only North American PGM mine operations are Stillwater and East Boulder (Montana, USA) and Lac des Iles (Ontario, Canada), but none are Rhodium mines per se.  For 2023, Natural Resources Canada reports Canada’s entire Rhodium production at only ~3,000 troy ounces (≈0.093 metric ton) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)), all as a by-product from North American Palladium’s Lac des Iles (which also yielded ~166,000 oz Pt and 518,000 oz Pd that year ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz))).  The United States reported *no* rhodium output in 2023 (the two Sibanye-Stillwater mines’ production – ~120–150 koz of Pt+Pd concentrate ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/#:~:text=The%20Stillwater%20mine%20currently%20produces,2024%2C%20and%20the%20Stillwater%20East)) – would correspond to only a few hundred kilograms of Rh at most).  No Australian, EU, Japanese or Nordic mines produce Rhodium.  Thus US/allied mines produce <<1 t/yr (total North America ≪0.1 t) while global mine output is ~30 t/yr ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)) (South Africa alone ~26.9 t in 2023 ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,%28%202))).  In summary, US+allies currently supply only a few hundred kilograms of Rh per year (byproduct of Pt/Pd mining), a trivial fraction of the ~30 t global production ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)) ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Rhodium demand is dominated by automotive catalytic converters (for NOx control) and industrial catalysts.  In North America, demand is forecast to rise above pre‐COVID levels.  For example, Statista projects ~225,000 troy oz of Rh demand in North America by 2025 (~7 t) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307394/worldwide-rhodium-demand-by-region/#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20demand%20for,of%20catalytic%20converters%20for%20automobiles)), driven by tightening emissions standards (Sibanye notes Rh use “continues to increase with ongoing tightening of emissions legislation” ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/about-us/about-pgms/rhodium/#:~:text=Rhodium%20is%20the%20most%20effective,tooling%20in%20the%20glass%20industry))).  Since ~80% of Rh is used in auto catalysts ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=Manitoba%2C%20and%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador,%28%202)), demand in the US+Canada by 2030 will still be several tonnes per year (on the order of 5–8 t/yr) if gasoline vehicle production remains substantial.  Europe (EU+UK+Norway/Iceland) similarly consumes on the order of a few tonnes annually (Europe’s large auto fleet historically used hundreds of thousands of ounces), and Japan on the order of 1–2 t.  Altogether, US+allies could demand roughly 10–15 t/yr by 2030 (e.g. NA ~7 t, Europe ~5 t, Japan ~2 t), barring aggressive EV substitution.  Non‐automotive uses (nitric-acid and acetic-acid catalysts, glass furnaces, electrical contacts) add a few more tonnes.  Industry forecasts (e.g. Johnson Matthey/SFA) anticipate global Rh demand rising to ~35–40 t by 2030, so the Western/allied share (roughly 40–50% of auto markets) implies ~14–20 t ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307394/worldwide-rhodium-demand-by-region/#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20demand%20for,of%20catalytic%20converters%20for%20automobiles)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Without new mines, US/allied domestic Rhodium supply by 2030 will remain very limited.  Current mining will contribute essentially the same few hundred kilograms per year (Stillwater/East Boulder and Lac des Iles), and no major new mines are on stream.  For example, exploration at Stillwater West (Montana) has yielded promising assays (up to 1.13 g/t Rh in core) ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/677-tsx-venture/pge/169823-stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1-13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project-montana-usa-and-comments-on-bipartisan-support-for-us-miners.html#:~:text=,product%20grades%20including)), but this project is years from production if confirmed.  Canada’s Marathon (Generation Mining) and other PGM projects are still under development and unlikely to add significant Rh by 2030.  In practice, domestic “supply” will largely be met by recycling spent catalysts.  Global recycling already adds ~10 t/yr to supply ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)) ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=mining%2C%20despite%20the%20rarity%20of,predicted%20to%20reach%2041%20metric)), so US/allied scrap-collection might muster a few tonnes.  Even so, total US+allied supply (mined + recycled) will be only a small fraction of demand.  In best-case estimates, domestic production + recycling in 2030 might reach on the order of 3–5 t/yr—nowhere near the ~15+ t/yr required—necessitating heavy reliance on imports and secondary recovery ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)) ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=mining%2C%20despite%20the%20rarity%20of,predicted%20to%20reach%2041%20metric)).

Global supply/demand estimates come from consulting reports (e.g. SFA/Oxford figures compiled by Nikolo Roza) indicating ~30 t global Rh in 2024 and ~41 t by 2032 ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)), with ~80–90% of Rh from South African PGMs ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=tons%20%28,%28%202)).  Statista’s market studies project North American Rh demand (~225,000 oz in 2025 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307394/worldwide-rhodium-demand-by-region/#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20demand%20for,of%20catalytic%20converters%20for%20automobiles))).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Airborne Geophysics**: High-resolution magnetics and gravity surveys are used to map buried mafic/ultramafic intrusions (the host rocks for PGM deposits).  Dense mineralization (e.g. magnetite-rich layers) in layered intrusions produces distinctive magnetic/gravity anomalies.  For instance, geoscientists target structures analogous to the Stillwater Complex or Bushveld by matching geophysical signatures to known PGE “hotspots” ([www.gov.mb.ca](https://www.gov.mb.ca/iem/geo/pges/index.html#:~:text=Geoscientific%20investigations%20indicate%20that%20PGE,or%20are%20underexplored%20for%20PGE)).  
• **Aerial/LIDAR Surveys**: Remote sensing (e.g. satellite or UAV-based) can identify exposed ultramafic outcrops or alteration zones (e.g. serpentinization or iron staining) that might underlie PGE mineralization.  
• **Geochemical Prospecting**: Systematic soil, till and stream-sediment geochemical grids detect pathfinder elements.  Analysts look for Pd/Pt/Cu/Ni anomalies (often with trace Rh) down-ice or down-stream from buried ultramafic intrusions, providing drill targets.  Portable XRF and ICP analyses of rock samples highlight PGE ‘fertile’ intrusions.  
• **Structural Geology & Mapping**: Field mapping identifies shear zones or feeder dikes within cratonic regions (analogous to the Norilsk intrusions) where PGMs may accumulate.  Detailed field mapping (with geochemistry) in Archean shields pinpoints favorable layered complexes. Manitoba surveys note such PGE-rich magma chambers are preserved in the Canadian Shield ([www.gov.mb.ca](https://www.gov.mb.ca/iem/geo/pges/index.html#:~:text=Geoscientific%20investigations%20indicate%20that%20PGE,or%20are%20underexplored%20for%20PGE)).  
• **Geophysical Drilling Techniques**: Once targets are identified, directional and deep-core drilling (often with downhole EM or magnetics) directly tests for PGM reefs.  Seismic reflection may also be used in stable cratonic areas to image layered complexes at depth if budgets allow.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Ore Concentration (Froth Flotation)**: Crushed and milled ores are processed via froth flotation to concentrate sulfide minerals that host PGMs ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/#:~:text=Ore%20from%20the%20operation%20is,the%20town%20of%20Columbus%2C%20Montana)).  For example, the Stillwater site mills J-M Reef ore and produces a platinum/palladium concentrate in its concentrators ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/#:~:text=Ore%20from%20the%20operation%20is,the%20town%20of%20Columbus%2C%20Montana)).  This step separates the PGM-bearing sulphides from barren gangue.  
• **Pyrometallurgy (Smelting & Converting)**: The sulfide concentrate is smelted at high temperature (e.g. in flash or reverberatory furnaces) to produce a copper-nickel matte containing PGMs.  Bases are removed by converting (oxygen-blown converters), leaving a PGM-rich speiss or matte.  Sibanye’s Columbus, MT smelter carries out this stage for Stillwater concentrates ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/#:~:text=Ore%20from%20the%20operation%20is,the%20town%20of%20Columbus%2C%20Montana)).  Some new projects may use pressure oxidation (hydrothermal oxidation) – e.g. Marathon-Palladium’s planned HPAL process – to handle refractory PGM sulfides without smelting.  
• **Hydrometallurgy (Leaching)**: In principle, milled or roasted concentrates can be treated by acid or chloride leaching to dissolve base metals and some PGMs.  In practice, nitric/hydrochloric (aqua regia) and chloride roast processes are used to strip Pt/Pd into solution, leaving Rhodium in the residue.  These leach “pregnant solutions” then undergo separation (see below).  Experimental methods (chloride leach with subsequent resin capture) have been demonstrated for PGM ores and spent catalysts.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX)**: Liquid–liquid extraction using organic solvents or ionic liquids selectively separates Pt, Pd, Rh from each other.  Continuous mixer-settler banks treat leach solutions: for example, tributyl phosphate or ionic liquid systems preferentially extract Pd/Pt, leaving a Rh-rich raffinate. Recent studies demonstrate counter-current SX can recover all three metals from catalyst leachates.  
• **Ion-Exchange Resins**: Specialty resins (polyamine–silica composites, e.g. Lewatit TP-series) bind PGM complexes from very acidic solutions.  These resins capture Pt, Pd, Ir, Rh, etc., allowing wash and elute steps ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2006113284A2/en#:~:text=,because%20they%20are%20either%20chemically)).  For instance, a non-cross-linked polyamine composite resin will selectively strip all PGM from chloride media; then Rh can be eluted separately ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2006113284A2/en#:~:text=,because%20they%20are%20either%20chemically)).  Ion-exchange is especially effective for recovering Rh from complex chloride solutions after Pt/Pd removal.  
• **Selective Precipitation**: Chemical reagents are used to precipitate Rhodium compounds from solution.  In the classic “Wai method”, adding excess ammonium salts to a chloride solution precipitates ammonium hexachlororhodate, (NH₄)₃[RhCl₆]·xH₂O.  This compound is filtered off, separating Rh from Pt/Pd.  Other precipitants (e.g. barium or zinc salts) can remove interfering metals, leaving a purified Rh solution for recovery.  
• **Electrochemical Separation**: Redox methods can drop out metals in sequence.  For example, SO₂ or HCl gas sparging removes Pd/Pt by forming insoluble species, leaving Rh in solution.  Alternatively, Rhodium can be electrodeposited directly from chloride medium onto a cathode once other metals are removed.  Such electrorefining is used on small scale for ultimate purification.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Calcination & Reduction**: The precipitated Rh compound (e.g. NH₄₃[RhCl₆] salt) is heated or chemically reduced to metal.  For instance, ammonium rhodium chloride is typically calcined in a furnace (often under hydrogen or vacuum) to yield high-purity Rhodium powder or sponge.  
• **Electrolytic Refining**: Rhodium can be purified by electrolysis.  A common industrial approach is to dissolve Rh in strong acid and plate it onto cathodes at controlled potential.  The plated Rh is then scraped off and melted.  Platinum-group refineries use bipolar chlor-alkali cells or specialized PGM electrorefiners to achieve 99.9% Rh purity.  
• **Vacuum Distillation/Melting**: Given Rhodium’s high melting point (1964°C) and vapor pressure, vacuum induction melting can produce metal ingots with extreme purity.  Final steps often involve multiple melting passes under chlorine gas or vacuum to remove trace contaminants.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Backfill**: To minimize surface waste, many mines pump milled tailings underground.  At Stillwater, ≈52% of concentrator tailings are mixed as paste and returned as underground backfill ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/#:~:text=)).  This reduces the volume sent to surface impoundments and encloses sulfides away from water/air.  
• **Water Treatment**: Processing plants incorporate effluent treatment systems.  Lime or limestone neutralization is widely used to precipitate heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) and adjust pH before discharge.  For example, the Stillwater/East Boulder complex includes on-site water clarifiers and treatment ponds ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/#:~:text=contain%20the%20concentrator%2C%20surface%20workshop%2C,treatment%2C%20storage%20facilities%2C%20and%20offices)) to scrub dissolved metals from process water.  
• **Dust & Landscaping Controls**: Tailings dams and waste rock dumps are contoured and sometimes sprayed with fixatives or covered with vegetative growth (hardy grasses or microbial mats) to prevent acid rock drainage and stabilize dust.  Colloidal or polymer binders may be added to the top layer of tailings to reduce oxidation.  
• **Reagent Recycling and Detox**: Spent reagents (e.g. cyanide from processing if used, or residual acids) are regenerated or neutralized.  For example, copper ions can be reclaimed from leachate with cement sulfation, minimizing heavy metal load.  Experimental approaches (e.g. bacterial sulfate reduction) are also under study to clean PGM tailings water, though not yet mainstream.

Patent literature and refining reviews detail advanced separation (e.g. polyamine resin extraction of Rh ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2006113284A2/en#:~:text=,because%20they%20are%20either%20chemically))).  Company press releases and technical studies for projects like Wellgreen (Yukon) and Marathon outline planned HPAL and flotation circuits.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The principal bottleneck is **resource availability and discovery**: no breakthrough exploration technology has unlocked a new domestic Rhodium deposit.  PGMs occur in very few geological settings (layered mafic intrusions), most of which are already exploited abroad ([www.gov.mb.ca](https://www.gov.mb.ca/iem/geo/pges/index.html#:~:text=Geoscientific%20investigations%20indicate%20that%20PGE,or%20are%20underexplored%20for%20PGE)).  Without a new mine, allied output cannot grow.  On the processing side, Rhodium extraction/refinement still requires multi-step, high‐energy methods (smelting then complex hydrometals chemistry); there are no cost-effective shortcuts or novel hydrometallurgical processes proven for grassroots PGM ores.  In short, the absence of a large domestic deposit – and the high complexity of splitting Rh from Pt/Pd – are the key “technological” constraints. 

## Key Bottleneck summary  
In summary, the choke point for US/allied Rhodium production is simply **lack of a domestic source**.  About 80–90% of world Rhodium comes from South African PGMs ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=tons%20%28,%28%202)); the US/EU have none of comparable scale.  Allied production has no levers to increase via technology alone – discovery of a new orebody is needed.  Existing USGC PGM flowsheets (flotation→smelt→multi-step separation) are proven but capital- and energy-intensive, making small sources uneconomical.  Thus, without a new deposit or major recycling surge, domestic supply will remain a tiny fraction of demand ([nikolaroza.com](https://nikolaroza.com/rhodium-industry-statistics-facts-trends-data/#:~:text=,of%20platinum%2C%20rhodium%2C%20ruthenium%20and)) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).
