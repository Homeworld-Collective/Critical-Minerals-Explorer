## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Domestic sources remain the limiting factor; PGMs occur in very few geological settings; multi-step processing required*  

PGM deposits are extremely rare and are almost exclusively hosted in large, layered mafic/ultramafic intrusions ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361147726_A_review_of_the_emplacement_and_formation_of_magmatic_platinum-group_elements-enriched_deposits_in_large_layered_maficultramafic_intrusions_with_special_reference_to_the_big_three_Stillwater_Complex_G#:~:text=Layered%20intrusions%20occur%20on%20every,in%20these%20intrusions%20are%20generally)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-studies-architecture-large-igneous-systems-hosting-magmatic-ore#:~:text=Platinum%20group%20elements%2C%20also%20known,gravity%2C%20magnetotellurics%2C%20and%20seismic%20tomography)).  The “Big Three” intrusions – the Bushveld (South Africa), Great Dyke (Zimbabwe), and Stillwater (USA) – contain the vast majority of the world’s PGE resources ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361147726_A_review_of_the_emplacement_and_formation_of_magmatic_platinum-group_elements-enriched_deposits_in_large_layered_maficultramafic_intrusions_with_special_reference_to_the_big_three_Stillwater_Complex_G#:~:text=Layered%20intrusions%20occur%20on%20every,in%20these%20intrusions%20are%20generally)).  South Africa’s Bushveld Complex alone accounts for roughly two-thirds to 90% of known PGM reserves ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361147726_A_review_of_the_emplacement_and_formation_of_magmatic_platinum-group_elements-enriched_deposits_in_large_layered_maficultramafic_intrusions_with_special_reference_to_the_big_three_Stillwater_Complex_G#:~:text=Layered%20intrusions%20occur%20on%20every,in%20these%20intrusions%20are%20generally)) ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2870%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  Accordingly, the bulk of rhodium supply comes from South African PGE mines (on the order of 80–85%) with Russia (Norilsk–Talnakh) providing most of the remainder ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2024/stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1.13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project/#:~:text=,Stillwater%E2%80%99s%20Stillwater%20West%20project%20across)).  North America has no comparable primary rhodium deposit: Civil with only small, known PGM orebodies (Stillwater/East Boulder in Montana and Lac des Îles in Ontario) acting as by-product sources ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=Mineable%20PGM%20deposits%20are%20very,products%20of%20nickel%20mining%20%5B5)) ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2024/stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1.13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project/#:~:text=supply%20in%20North%20America.%20,M%20Reef%20deposit)). In short, no new large domestic deposit is known, so the only way to materially increase U.S./allied output would be to discover a new orebody.  

On the processing side, conventional PGM extraction is a complex, multi-step sequence.  Ores are first concentrated by froth flotation to produce a sulfide-rich concentrate ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=PGM%20processing%20consists%20principally%20of,base%20metal%20smelter%2C%20an%20upgraded)).  This concentrate is smelted (typically in flash or electric furnaces with silica and limestone flux) to yield a Ni–Cu matte containing the PGMs ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=PGM%20processing%20consists%20principally%20of,base%20metal%20smelter%2C%20an%20upgraded)).  Base metals are then stripped (via air-blown conversion and/or leaching/bern processes) to leave a PGM-enriched matte or “slime.”  These MX inert slimes are processed by chloride leaching, and the resulting metal-bearing solutions are separated into individual PGMs.  This conventional flowsheet (flotation→smelting/roasting→leaching→multi-stage separation) is highly capital- and energy-intensive ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=PGM%20processing%20consists%20principally%20of,base%20metal%20smelter%2C%20an%20upgraded)).  Alternative hydrometallurgical routes (e.g. pressure oxidation of sulfides at elevated temperature/pressure ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=sheets%20commonly%20comprise%20at%20least,sulphate%20or%20to%20oxidise%20them)), or biological oxidation using specialized bacteria) have been studied, but none has displaced smelting as the practical route for primary PGM ores.  In sum, existing technology for rhodium recovery is mature but bulky: without very large throughput, the economics do not work for small domestic sources.  Thus the critical bottleneck is simply that **no large domestic deposit exists** ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2024/stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1.13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project/#:~:text=,Stillwater%E2%80%99s%20Stillwater%20West%20project%20across)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=Mineable%20PGM%20deposits%20are%20very,products%20of%20nickel%20mining%20%5B5)), and refining of any recovered Rh requires conventional flowsheets that lack any simple shortcuts.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: Negligible (<1 t/yr)*  

Current rhodium mine production in the U.S. and its allies is effectively zero or negligible.  In 2023, Canadian mines (primarily Lac des Iles) produced only ~3,000 troy ounces of rhodium (≈0.093 metric tons) as a by-product ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=%2846%2C000%C2%A0oz.%29%20,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  The United States has **no standalone rhodium mine**; its only PGM sources are Stillwater and East Boulder in Montana, which together yielded ~427 thousand ounces of 2E platinum+ palladium in 2023 ([reports.sibanyestillwater.com](https://reports.sibanyestillwater.com/2023/#:~:text=)).  At typical Stillwater grades, that 427 koz of Pt+Pd (≈13.3 t) would have contained only a few hundred kilograms of Rh (consistent with statements that “South Africa dominates global production [and] there is very little mine supply in North America” ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2024/stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1.13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project/#:~:text=,Stillwater%E2%80%99s%20Stillwater%20West%20project%20across))).  No other U.S., European, Australian or Japanese operations produce appreciable rhodium.  By contrast, global production is measured in tens of tons per year; for example, South Africa alone yielded ~559,000 troy ounces (≈17.4 t) in 2023 ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2870%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  Thus U.S./allied mines collectively produce well under **1 ton per year**.  This output is only a tiny fraction of the ~22 t of rhodium mined globally each year ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2870%2C000%C2%A0oz)) ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=%2846%2C000%C2%A0oz.%29%20,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ~12–18 t/yr*  

Rhodium demand (~90% of the PGM in autocatalysts) is dominated by the automotive sector, where it is essential for NOₓ control in gasoline engines ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rhodium-price-rally-forecast-to-continue-on-firm-demand-constrained-supply-2019-10-04#:~:text=He%20points%20out%20that%20established,in%20advance%20to%20meet%20demand)).  Current forecasts suggest North American Rh demand will be on the order of a few hundred thousand ounces (~6–8 t/yr) by the mid-2020s, driven by tightening emissions standards ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rhodium-price-rally-forecast-to-continue-on-firm-demand-constrained-supply-2019-10-04#:~:text=He%20points%20out%20that%20established,in%20advance%20to%20meet%20demand)).  Europe (including EU+UK+Norway/Iceland) is of comparable size: historically it has consumed several hundred thousand ounces annually (several tons) of rhodium in vehicle catalysts.  Japan’s auto market adds another couple of tons.  Aggregating these allied markets implies on the order of 10–15 t/yr among U.S., European, and Japanese auto-makers by 2030 (roughly 40–50% of the ~30 t global demand).  Non-automotive uses – e.g. nitric and acetic acid oxidation catalysts, specialty glasses, electrical contacts, etc. – account for only a few tons globally.  In broad terms, industry analysts project **global rhodium demand** to reach on the order of 30–35 t/yr by 2030; Western/autocatalyst demand will be roughly half that ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rhodium-price-rally-forecast-to-continue-on-firm-demand-constrained-supply-2019-10-04#:~:text=He%20points%20out%20that%20established,in%20advance%20to%20meet%20demand)).  (For example, Statista cites North American demand ~225,000 oz (~7 t) by 2025 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307394/worldwide-rhodium-demand-by-region/#:~:text=In%202025%2C%20the%20demand%20for,of%20catalytic%20converters%20for%20automobiles)), and Johnson Matthey notes ~85% of all rhodium is used in autocatalysts ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rhodium-price-rally-forecast-to-continue-on-firm-demand-constrained-supply-2019-10-04#:~:text=He%20points%20out%20that%20established,in%20advance%20to%20meet%20demand)).)  In short, even moderate emissions tightening would keep allied demand high – on the order of a dozen tons per year – for the foreseeable future.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ~2–4 t/yr (mostly recycling)*  

With no new mines expected to come online, U.S./allied rhodium “supply” by 2030 will still be overwhelmingly import-dependent.  Primary mining from Stillwater/East Boulder and Lac des Îles will remain at effectively the same low levels (<0.1 t/yr total) unless unexpected new discoveries occur.  For example, Stillwater Critical’s recent drilling at Stillwater West (a prospective intrusion in Montana) identified elevated Rh in core (e.g. 1.13 g/t over 1.2 m) ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2024/stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1.13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project/#:~:text=Highlights%20include%3A)), but this project is still in exploration – far from production.  Likewise, other PGM projects in Canada (Marathon, Ring of Fire etc.) are planned on long timelines.  In practice, nearly all future U.S./allied Rh supply must come from recycling.  Spent autocatalysts from domestic vehicles can be processed to recover Rh: today’s refiners already reclaim several tons of Rh per year from global catalyst scrap, and further gains in collection rates (especially in the U.S.) could yield a few additional tons by 2030.  Even under optimistic scenarios, recycled U.S./allied output might reach only 2–4 t/yr.  In summary, **domestic production+recycling** by 2030 is unlikely to exceed a few tons (perhaps 2–4 t) – vastly below the projected ~12–18 t/yr demand – so dependence on imports (mainly from South Africa/Russia) will remain very high ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2024/stillwater-critical-minerals-reports-up-to-1.13-g-t-rhodium-in-drill-results-from-the-stillwater-west-pge-ni-cu-co-au-project/#:~:text=,M%20Reef%20deposit)) ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rhodium-price-rally-forecast-to-continue-on-firm-demand-constrained-supply-2019-10-04#:~:text=He%20points%20out%20that%20established,in%20advance%20to%20meet%20demand)).

Demand projections come from industry analysts and market research (e.g. JM market reports, trade associations); one recent statistic notes ~85% of Rh demand is automotive ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/rhodium-price-rally-forecast-to-continue-on-firm-demand-constrained-supply-2019-10-04#:~:text=He%20points%20out%20that%20established,in%20advance%20to%20meet%20demand)).

Recycling contributions (already ~25–30% of Rh supply) are noted in the technical literature as well.  

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Geophysics, remote sensing, mapping, drilling*  

**Airborne geophysics:**  High-resolution magnetic and gravity surveys are key tools for locating buried mafic-ultramafic intrusions.  Such surveys can detect the dense, magnetite-rich layers or feeder zones characteristic of PGE-bearing intrusions ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-studies-architecture-large-igneous-systems-hosting-magmatic-ore#:~:text=This%20project%20will%20use%20new,Beaver%20Bay%20Complex%2C%20Minnesota%2C%20Mellen)).  In particular, magnetic anomaly patterns and dense gravity signatures (often focused near known feeder dikes) are used to target new exploration sites similar to Stillwater or Bushveld.  Modern projects commonly deploy fixed-wing or helicopter-borne magnetics and gravimetry over suspected layered complexes, looking for the “fingerprint” of layered mafic stratigraphy ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-studies-architecture-large-igneous-systems-hosting-magmatic-ore#:~:text=This%20project%20will%20use%20new,Beaver%20Bay%20Complex%2C%20Minnesota%2C%20Mellen)).  

**Aerial/LiDAR mapping:**  At the outcrop scale, satellite imagery and aerial LiDAR help identify ultramafic rock exposures and alteration halos.  Spectral and hyperspectral sensors can pick out serpentinization, iron-oxide staining, or other geochemical alteration along the top of ophiolitic/mafic bodies that might host PGM anomalies.  UAV surveys have even been used to find subtle soil/vegetation anomalies above hidden intrusions.  These remote techniques extend mapping into remote areas (e.g. Canada’s Precambrian Shield) with thick overburden by revealing any surface expression of ultramafic lithologies.  

**Geochemical prospecting:**  Systematic surface sampling (soil, glacial till, and stream sediment grids) is used to detect PGEs derived from concealed intrusions.  Analysts look for coincident Pd–Pt–Cu–Ni anomalies (with minor Rh) that may be dispersed down-ice/down-stream from an orebody.  Heavy-mineral concentrate methods (sieved till samples) can concentrate PGE-bearing minerals for microanalysis ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/3/264/htm#:~:text=obscure%20bedrock%20geology,initially%20developed%20for%20gold%20grains)).  State-of-the-art techniques (e.g. automated SEM/EDS image analysis) are now employed to identify even sub-100 μm PGE grains in tills ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/3/264/htm#:~:text=obscure%20bedrock%20geology,initially%20developed%20for%20gold%20grains)).  Geochemical pathfinder elements (As, Cu, Ni, Cr) and minor Rh counts guide drill targeting.  Portable XRF and ICP-MS are routinely used on field samples to quickly flag elevated PGM values.  

**Structural geology and mapping:**  Traditional field mapping is still crucial.  Geologists identify key structures – e.g. feeder dikes, sills, or shear zones – that may localize PGE mineralization.  Detailed mapping of Archean cratons (Canadian Shield, Finland, Australia) targets any preserved layered intrusions analogously to Bushveld or Stillwater.  Magnetic foliation maps combined with surface geology help pinpoint distal feeder channels.  Outcrop sampling of known intrusions guides correlation of prospective stratigraphy.  

**Geophysical drilling and depth imaging:**  Once surface targets are defined, diamond-core drilling (often deep) directly tests for mineralized reefs.  Modern rigs can drill several kilometers if needed.  Downhole geophysics (e.g. borehole EM/magnetics) can refine targets between holes.  In some cases, reflection seismic (expensive) has been applied to image the internal layering of very large intrusions.  Ultimately, discovery requires drilling; geophysical and geochemical tools serve to focus the drill program on the highest-probability zones.  

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Froth flotation; smelting/converting; alternative oxide/microbial treatments under study*  

**Ore concentration (Flotation):**  Crushed and milled PGM ores are processed by froth flotation to produce a sulfide concentrate enriched in Ni–Cu–PGMs ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=PGM%20processing%20consists%20principally%20of,base%20metal%20smelter%2C%20an%20upgraded)).  For example, today’s operations grind ores to liberate sulphide grains and use xanthate/collector reagents to float a PGM-bearing matte concentrate.  At Stillwater (MT) and similar mines, the flotation circuit produces a platinum–palladium concentrate grading on the order of 1–3 oz PGM per ton (60–90 g/t total Pt+Pd) – which is then sent for smelting.  

**Pyrometallurgical smelting & converting:**  Sulfide concentrates are smelted at ~1300–1600 °C (in flash or electric furnaces) with flux (lime/silica) to produce a copper–nickel matte and separate slag ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=PGM%20processing%20consists%20principally%20of,base%20metal%20smelter%2C%20an%20upgraded)).  The matte contains most of the PGMs plus Cu, Ni, Co.  This matte is then converted (oxygen blown) to remove iron and sulfur, yielding a PGM-rich “converter matte.”  For instance, Sibanye-Stillwater’s Columbus smelter (MT) processes Stillwater concentrate in this manner.  New projects sometimes consider hydrometallurgical “pressurized oxidation” (POX) of concentrates to oxidize sulphides without a high-temperature furnace ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=sheets%20commonly%20comprise%20at%20least,sulphate%20or%20to%20oxidise%20them)).  However, conventional smelting remains the industry standard, as it efficiently separates gangue (in slag) and concentrates PGMs.  

**Hydrometallurgy (Leaching):**  Alternatively, roasted or POX-treated concentrates can be leached chemically.  High-strength hydrochloric acid or chloride filtrates (often under oxygen pressure) dissolve base metals and allow PGMs to form soluble chloro-complexes.  For example, chloride leaching with Cl₂/HCl can dissolve Pt, Pd, Rh into solution, leaving behind a solids residue.  These pregnant solutions then go to the refinery stage.  Researchers are also investigating bio-oxidation of low-grade ores: specialized bacteria (Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans or others) have been tested to oxidize sulphide ores at moderate conditions.  Such bioleaching trials (along with various pre-oxidation roasting or POX steps) aim to handle complex or refractory PGM–Ni–Cu ores without conventional smelting ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/8/4/203#:~:text=sheets%20commonly%20comprise%20at%20least,sulphate%20or%20to%20oxidise%20them)).  

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction, ion exchange, precipitation, electrowinning*  

**Solvent Extraction (SX):**  Liquid–liquid extraction is widely used to separate Pt, Pd and Rh from chloride leachates. Organic extractants (e.g. organophosphorus or amine reagents) selectively bind one metal and not others.  Continuous mixer–settler circuits use these reagents to partition metals: for example, tributyl phosphate or secondary amines may preferentially extract Pd and Pt as chloro-complexes, leaving rhodium behind.  Research has also explored novel systems (e.g. ionic liquids or task-specific extractants) with improved Rh selectivity.  After loading, each metal is stripped from the organic phase in sequence.  Solvent extraction processes are long-established in PGM refineries (Hartley, Implats etc.) for this purpose ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586620313708?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8db8973e1c0f81ca#:~:text=been%20conventionally%20used%20in%20industries,commercially%20exploited%20in%20various%20refineries)).  

**Ion-Exchange Resins:**  Specialized ion-exchange materials are increasingly employed.  Strong-base and strong-acid resins (often with chelating functional groups) can capture Pt, Pd, Rh chloride complexes from solution.  For example, gel-type resins with amine or quaternary ammonium groups selectively bind precious metal chlorides.  “Molecular recognition” resins – polymer beads impregnated with organic ligands – have been developed to preferentially adsorb Rh(III) over Pt/Pd ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586620313708?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8db8973e1c0f81ca#:~:text=impurities,in%20this%20area%20is%20provided)).  After loading, the resin is eluted in steps to recover each PGM separately.  These resin processes can achieve very high purity without large organic waste streams.  

**Selective Precipitation:**  Classic methods still play a role.  In chloride media, selective precipitants can isolate Rh or Pt/Pd.  For example, adding ammonium chloride under controlled conditions precipitates ammonium hexachlororhodate, (NH₄)₃[RhCl₆], filtering off solid Rh.  Similarly, platinum may be precipitated as ammonium hexachloroplatinate using excess ammonium chloride, and palladium as ammonium diammine chloride complexes.  Other reagents (e.g. zinc dust or sulfide reagents) are used to cement-out or sulfide-precipitate base-metal impurities, leaving clean Rh in solution.  These wet-chemical steps are often intermediate between SX/IX stages.  

**Electrochemical Separation:**  Finally, once PGMs are in solution, selective reduction by applied voltage can complete the separation.  For example, introduction of aqueous SO₂ selectively plates out Pt and Pd onto cathodes first, leaving the bulk of Rh in solution.  Afterwards, Rh can be electrodeposited from its chloride solution onto cathodes under controlled potential.  Rhodium is typically non-adsorptive on graphite at low potential, making it separable after other metals are removed.  Such electrowinning steps yield rhodium powder or sponge that is >99% pure.

*Summary: Chemical conversion to metal; electrolytic purification; final melting and refining*  

**Calcination & Reduction:**  The final pure rhodium metal is obtained by decomposing or reducing its precipitated compounds.  In practice, ammonium rhodium chloride salts are thermally decomposed (usually under hydrogen) at ~600–800°C to yield metallic rhodium sponge.  Alternatively, chemical reducers (e.g. hydrogen, formic acid) are used to precipitate fine rhodium powder from rhodium chloride solutions.  These methods produce loose “rhodesium black” which is then melted or sintered.  

**Electrolytic Refining:**  To reach ultra-high purity, rhodium may undergo electrorefining.  Impure rhodium is dissolved in a chloride medium (often with CaCl₂ or HCl flux) and then re-electroplated onto cathodes at a controlled potential.  Multiple electrolytic passes can remove trace impurities.  This step is analogous to platinum and copper refining, and commercial rhodium is typically refined to ≥99.95% purity by such electrochemical cycles.  

**Vacuum Melting & Zone Refining:**  Given rhodium’s very high melting point (1964°C) and refractory nature, final refining often uses vacuum induction furnaces or electron-beam melting.  Under vacuum or inert atmosphere, the rhodium sponge/powder is melted into ingots.  Multiple melting passes (sometimes with salt flux) remove residual oxygen, sulfur or other contaminants.  In critical applications, zone refining (slowly moving a molten zone along a solid rod) can further segregate impurities.  The end product is typically 99.99%+ rhodium metal, cast into ingots or alloys as required for applications (e.g. 2–10% Rh–Pt alloy wire for thermocouples, or pure Rh for catalysis).  

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Underground backfill; water/effluent treatment; dust control; reagent recycling*  

**Tailings Backfill:**  To minimize surface waste and stabilize mined-out stopes, modern PGM mines use backfill extensively.  At Stillwater/East Boulder, roughly half of the mill tailings solids are mixed with water (and often a binder) and pumped underground as paste or “sandfill” backfill ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786909/000178690924000013/exhibit961technicalrepor.htm#:~:text=reduction%2C%20with%20approximately%2044,at%20East%20Boulder%20Mine%20used)).  About 44–50% of tailings from Stillwater and 46–48% from East Boulder were returned underground in 2023 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786909/000178690924000013/exhibit961technicalrepor.htm#:~:text=reduction%2C%20with%20approximately%2044,at%20East%20Boulder%20Mine%20used)).  This combined paste/sand backfill not only disposes of waste underground, but also provides stope support.  In practice, backfill may contain ~8–12% cement to harden the tailings paste where needed ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1786909/000178690924000013/exhibit961technicalrepor.htm#:~:text=illustrated%20in%20Figure%2052,Where%20ground)).  The reduced surface tailings volume lowers the footprint and long-term environmental risk of impoundments.  

**Water Treatment:**  Circuit and drainage water are treated before discharge.  Standard practice uses lime (Ca(OH)₂) neutralization to raise pH and precipitate dissolved metals (Cu, Ni, Zn, Fe as hydroxides or sulfides).  Clarifiers and settling ponds remove the precipitated flocs.  For example, at Stillwater the mill circuit includes neutralization tanks and settling basins that remove >95% of dissolved metals before wastewater is released.  In some cases, ion-exchange or precipitation steps (e.g. adding sulfide to remove residual Cu/Ni) further polish the effluent.  Ongoing monitoring ensures that discharged water meets regulatory quality standards.   

**Dust & Revegetation Controls:**  Dump and tailings surfaces are managed to prevent erosion and oxidation.  Tailings forms (where not backfilled) are treated with layered capping, geosynthetics and revegetation. ([www.sibanyestillwater.com](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/sustainability/environment/tailings-management/#:~:text=Sibanye,in%20place%20to%20prevent%20failures))  Native grasses and shrubs are planted on reclaimed tailings.  Modern PGM tailings facilities use impermeable liners or covers and apply water sprays or polyacrylamide binders to minimize dust.  Internal roads are paved or surfaced to reduce turbidity.  

**Reagent Recovery and Biotreatment:**  Process chemicals are recycled where possible.  Spent acids (e.g. HCl) are recovered via distillation or neutralized.  Cyanide (if used in any recycling step) is destroyed (e.g. SO₂/air or H₂O₂ treatments) before discharge.  Piloting has begun on passive treatments: constructed wetlands or sulfate-reducing bioreactors can capture residual metals from seepage.  In these systems, organic substrates support bacteria that reduce sulfate to sulfide, precipitating dissolved metals as sulfides.  For instance, experimental SRB bioreactors placed below tailings dams can convert acidic, metal-laden runoff into neutral pH effluent with Fe and Ni precipitated.  Such engineered wetlands are under study in some PGM basins to further mitigate acid drainage.
