## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Geological scarcity; no major domestic PGM deposits; complex separation chemistry*

The principal bottleneck is **resource availability and discovery**: no breakthrough exploration technology has unlocked a new domestic Rhodium deposit. PGMs occur in very few geological settings (layered mafic intrusions), most of which are already exploited abroad, primarily in South Africa's Bushveld Complex and Russia's Norilsk deposits. Without a new mine discovery, allied output cannot grow materially. On the processing side, Rhodium extraction/refinement still requires multi-step, high-energy methods (smelting then complex hydrometallurgical chemistry); there are no cost-effective shortcuts or novel hydrometallurgical processes proven for grassroots PGM ores. The absence of a large domestic deposit – combined with the high complexity of separating Rh from Pt/Pd – represents the key constraint. About 80-85% of world Rhodium comes from South African PGMs; the US/EU have no deposits of comparable scale. Allied production has no technological levers to increase output significantly – discovery of a new orebody is essential. Existing PGM flowsheets (flotation→smelt→multi-step separation) are proven but capital- and energy-intensive, making small sources uneconomical.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: <1 ton/year*

Domestic Rhodium output in the US and its allies is essentially negligible. The only North American PGM mine operations are Stillwater and East Boulder (Montana, USA) and Lac des Iles (Ontario, Canada), but none are primary Rhodium mines. For 2023, Natural Resources Canada reports Canada's entire Rhodium production at 23,000 troy ounces (≈0.715 metric tons), all as a by-product from Impala Canada's Lac des Iles mine (which also yielded ~166,000 oz Pt and 518,000 oz Pd that year). The United States reported minimal rhodium output in 2023; the two Sibanye-Stillwater mines' annual production of ~425,000 oz of combined Pt+Pd would correspond to only a few hundred kilograms of Rh at typical ore ratios. While comprehensive data for Australian, EU, and Japanese rhodium production is limited, no significant PGM mining operations in these regions produce rhodium as a primary or significant by-product. Thus US/allied mines produce <1 t/yr while global mine output is approximately 30 t/yr (South Africa alone producing ~22-25 t in 2023, representing ~80-85% of global production). In summary, US+allies currently supply less than 1 metric ton of Rh per year (by-product of Pt/Pd mining), a trivial fraction of the ~30 t global production.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 12-18 tons/year*

Rhodium demand is dominated by automotive catalytic converters (for NOx control in gasoline engines) and industrial catalysts. In North America, demand is forecast to rise moderately from current levels. Market analysis projects ~225,000 troy oz of Rh demand in North America by 2025 (~7 t), driven by tightening emissions standards, particularly for gasoline vehicles where rhodium is irreplaceable for NOx reduction. Since ~80-85% of Rh is used in auto catalysts, demand in the US+Canada by 2030 will likely remain at 5-8 t/yr, assuming gasoline vehicle production continues alongside EV adoption. Europe (EU+UK+Norway/Iceland) similarly consumes 4-6 tonnes annually (Europe's large auto fleet historically used hundreds of thousands of ounces), and Japan consumes 2-3 t. Altogether, US+allies could demand roughly 12-18 t/yr by 2030 (e.g., NA ~7 t, Europe ~5 t, Japan ~2-3 t, other allies ~1 t), with actual demand heavily dependent on the pace of EV substitution. Non-automotive uses (nitric-acid and acetic-acid catalysts, glass furnaces, electrical contacts) add approximately 2-3 tonnes globally. Industry forecasts from major PGM market analysts anticipate global Rh demand of 32-35 t by 2030, so the Western/allied share (roughly 40-50% of auto markets) implies 12-18 t demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 2-4 tons/year (including recycling)*

Without new mines, US/allied domestic Rhodium supply by 2030 will remain very limited. Current mining will contribute essentially the same <1 ton per year (Stillwater/East Boulder and Lac des Iles), and no major new mines are expected to reach production by 2030. For example, exploration at Stillwater West (Montana) by Stillwater Critical Minerals has yielded promising drill results, but this project is still in early exploration stages and unlikely to produce before 2030. Canada's Marathon project (Generation Mining) and other PGM projects remain under development with production timelines extending beyond 2030. In practice, domestic "supply" will largely depend on recycling spent catalysts. Global recycling currently adds ~10-11 t/yr to supply, with US/allied recycling potentially contributing 3-4 tonnes by 2030 through improved collection and processing of spent automotive catalysts. Even with optimistic recycling scenarios, total US+allied supply (mined + recycled) will be only a small fraction of demand. Best-case estimates suggest domestic production + recycling in 2030 might reach 2-4 t/yr—far below the ~12-18 t/yr required—necessitating heavy reliance on imports from South Africa and Russia.

Production and demand figures are drawn from industry data and analysis: Natural Resources Canada PGM fact sheets list 2023 rhodium mine outputs by country (Canada: 23,000 oz). Sibanye-Stillwater annual reports provide North American PGM production data (Stillwater/East Boulder 2023: ~425,842 oz 2E output) from which Rh by-product can be estimated. Global supply/demand estimates come from Johnson Matthey PGM Market Reports and industry analyses indicating ~30 t global Rh production in 2023 and projected demand of 32-35 t by 2030, with ~80-85% of Rh supply from South African PGMs. Market research firms project North American Rh demand of approximately 225,000 oz in 2025 (~7 t), driven by emissions standards. Further details on mining volumes and recycling rates are corroborated by metal market publications and government geological surveys.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Airborne geophysics; geochemical sampling; core drilling; seismic imaging*

• **Airborne Geophysics**: High-resolution magnetics and gravity surveys are used to map buried mafic/ultramafic intrusions (the host rocks for PGM deposits). Dense mineralization (e.g., magnetite-rich layers) in layered intrusions produces distinctive magnetic/gravity anomalies. Geoscientists target structures analogous to the Stillwater Complex or Bushveld by matching geophysical signatures to known PGE mineralization patterns.

• **Aerial/LIDAR Surveys**: Remote sensing (satellite or UAV-based) can identify exposed ultramafic outcrops or alteration zones (e.g., serpentinization or iron staining) that might indicate PGE mineralization potential.

• **Geochemical Prospecting**: Systematic soil, till and stream-sediment geochemical grids detect pathfinder elements. Analysts look for Pd/Pt/Cu/Ni anomalies (often with trace Rh) down-ice or downstream from buried ultramafic intrusions, providing drill targets. Portable XRF and ICP-MS analyses of rock samples highlight PGE-prospective intrusions.

• **Structural Geology & Mapping**: Field mapping identifies shear zones or feeder dikes within cratonic regions where PGMs may accumulate. Detailed field mapping with geochemistry in Archean shields pinpoints favorable layered complexes. Such PGE-rich magma chambers are preserved in stable cratons like the Canadian Shield.

• **Geophysical Drilling Techniques**: Once targets are identified, directional and deep-core drilling (often with downhole EM or magnetics) directly tests for PGM reefs. Seismic reflection may also be used in stable cratonic areas to image layered complexes at depth where budgets allow.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Froth flotation; pyrometallurgical smelting; pressure oxidation; bioleaching trials*

• **Ore Concentration (Froth Flotation)**: Crushed and milled ores are processed via froth flotation to concentrate sulfide minerals that host PGMs. For example, the Stillwater operations mill ore to produce a platinum/palladium concentrate containing 2,000-2,500 oz/ton combined PGMs. This step separates the PGM-bearing sulphides from barren gangue minerals.

• **Pyrometallurgy (Smelting & Converting)**: The sulfide concentrate is smelted at high temperature (typically in flash or electric furnaces) to produce a copper-nickel matte containing PGMs. Base metals are removed by converting (oxygen-blown converters), leaving a PGM-rich matte. Sibanye's Columbus, MT smelter processes Stillwater concentrates using this conventional route. Some new projects are evaluating pressure oxidation (POX) – a hydrometallurgical alternative – to handle refractory PGM sulfides without smelting.

• **Hydrometallurgy (Leaching)**: Roasted or pressure-oxidized concentrates can be treated by acid or chloride leaching to dissolve base metals and PGMs. Conventional routes use hydrochloric acid with oxidants (chlorine gas or hydrogen peroxide) to dissolve PGMs into chloride complexes. These pregnant leach solutions then undergo separation. Experimental bioleaching methods using specialized bacteria are under development for low-grade PGM ores.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion exchange resins; selective precipitation; molecular recognition*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX)**: Liquid-liquid extraction using organic solvents selectively separates Pt, Pd, Rh from each other. Continuous mixer-settler circuits treat leach solutions: for example, tributyl phosphate or specialized amines preferentially extract Pd/Pt, leaving a Rh-enriched raffinate. Recent developments include ionic liquid systems that show improved selectivity for rhodium separation.

• **Ion-Exchange Resins**: Specialty resins (including modified silica-polyamine composites) bind PGM complexes from acidic chloride solutions. These resins capture Pt, Pd, and Rh with different affinities, allowing sequential elution. Modern molecular recognition technology resins show promise for selective Rh recovery from complex solutions after Pt/Pd removal.

• **Selective Precipitation**: Chemical reagents precipitate specific rhodium compounds from solution. Classical methods involve adding ammonium chloride to precipitate ammonium hexachlororhodate, (NH₄)₃[RhCl₆], which is filtered to separate Rh from Pt/Pd. Zinc cementation and sulfide precipitation are used to remove interfering metals, leaving purified Rh solutions.

• **Electrochemical Separation**: Controlled potential electrolysis can selectively reduce metals in sequence. SO₂ reduction selectively removes Pd/Pt, leaving Rh in solution. Rhodium can then be electrodeposited from chloride medium onto cathodes once other metals are removed. Such electrowinning is used for final recovery and initial purification.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Calcination; zone refining; plasma melting; chemical vapor transport*

• **Calcination & Reduction**: Precipitated Rh compounds (e.g., ammonium rhodium chloride salts) are thermally decomposed or chemically reduced to metal. Industrial practice involves calcination under hydrogen at 800-1000°C to yield high-purity rhodium sponge with >99.9% purity.

• **Electrolytic Refining**: Rhodium undergoes final purification by electrolysis in chloride media. Impure rhodium is dissolved and replated onto high-purity cathodes at controlled potential. Multiple dissolution-electrodeposition cycles achieve 99.95%+ purity required for catalytic applications.

• **Vacuum Melting**: Given rhodium's high melting point (1964°C), vacuum induction melting or electron beam melting produces metal ingots with extreme purity. Final refining often involves zone refining or multiple melting passes under controlled atmosphere to remove trace contaminants, achieving 99.99% purity for specialized applications.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Paste backfill; lime neutralization; constructed wetlands; sulfate-reducing bioreactors*

• **Tailings Backfill**: To minimize surface waste, many mines pump thickened tailings underground. At Stillwater, approximately 50% of concentrator tailings are mixed with cement as paste and returned underground as backfill. This reduces surface impoundment requirements and isolates sulfides from oxidation.

• **Water Treatment**: Processing plants incorporate comprehensive effluent treatment. Lime neutralization precipitates heavy metals (Cu, Ni, Zn) and adjusts pH before discharge. The Stillwater/East Boulder operations include clarifiers, settling ponds, and constructed wetlands to remove dissolved metals from process water before release.

• **Dust & Revegetation Controls**: Tailings facilities and waste rock dumps are contoured, capped, and revegetated with native species to prevent erosion and acid rock drainage. Polymer stabilizers or geosynthetic covers may be applied to tailings surfaces to minimize oxidation and dust generation.

• **Reagent Recovery and Detoxification**: Process chemicals are recycled where possible. Residual acids are neutralized, and any cyanide (if used in processing) is destroyed using SO₂/air or hydrogen peroxide systems. Sulfate-reducing bioreactors are being tested at some sites to treat acid mine drainage and precipitate metals as stable sulfides.

## Key Bottleneck summary
In summary, the critical constraint for US/allied Rhodium production is **lack of economically viable domestic deposits**. Approximately 80-85% of world rhodium comes from South African PGMs, with most of the remainder from Russia; the US/EU have no deposits of comparable scale or grade. Allied production cannot increase significantly through technology alone – discovery of a new major orebody is essential. Existing PGM processing flowsheets (flotation→smelt→multi-step separation) are technically mature but capital- and energy-intensive, making small deposits uneconomical. Thus, without a new deposit discovery or breakthrough in recycling efficiency, domestic supply will remain below 5% of demand, ensuring continued dependence on imports from geopolitically concentrated sources.
