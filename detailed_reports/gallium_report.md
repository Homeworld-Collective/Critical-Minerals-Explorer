## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:**  Essentially **0 t/yr** from mining (no active gallium mines) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/20819d8e-5d2b-4a12-9a50-edbfd07336ef#:~:text=China%20controls%2098,ore%2C%20mining%20for%20it%20became)).  The U.S. currently has no primary gallium production; all gallium (for example GaAs wafers) is imported or recovered from domestic recycling.  Indium Corporation (Memorial, NY) has prototyped gallium recovery from scrap, but no commercial-scale U.S. production exists.  
• **Canada:**  No current production.  The only domestic initiative is a new Rio Tinto/Indium Corp project (Quebec) which just produced its first gallium and aims for ~40 t/yr ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-extracts-first-gallium-under-collaboration-with-indium-2025-05-07/#:~:text=to%2040%20tonnes%20of%20gallium,reduce%20dependence%20on%20Chinese%20exports)).  Until facilities like these ramp up, Canadian output remains effectively nil.  
• **Australia:**  None.  Major alumina refineries (e.g. Worsley, Western Australia) produce large volumes of alumina but do not recover gallium.  (They contain ~50–100 ppm Ga in bauxite, but no commercial Gallium extraction lines are installed.)  
• **European Union (incl. UK, Norway, Iceland):**  Currently **0 t/yr**.  Legacy European producers (e.g. former operations in Germany) ceased by the 2010s ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20the%20world%27s%20production,320%20tons%20for%20refined%20gallium)).  A new project (Metlen Energy & Metals, Greece) plans to recover **~50 t/yr** by 2027 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c99de1a69863092fb40731a08f592e0d#:~:text=comerciales%20con%20China,productos%20sofisticados%20como%20veh%C3%ADculos%20el%C3%A9ctricos)), but until it comes online there is no EU output.  Norway/Iceland have no known Ga production.  
• **Japan:**  Also **0 t/yr** primary output.  Japan is a major consumer of gallium for semiconductors, but all is imported.  Roughly 80–95% of world production has been Chinese ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=China%20produced%20tons%20of%20low,primary%20gallium%20in%20North%20America)); Japan’s gallium needs (e.g. for GaN/LED chips) are supplied via imports.  (For context, Japanese imports from China fell 85% after export curbs in 2023 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/e679b887-00d8-4937-8a9d-1e2a8dd9c19a#:~:text=advanced%20technologies,war%2C%20deviating%20from%20global%20norms)).)  
• **Allies total:**  Currently essentially **0** domestic production.  Even with pilots, allied (US + Canada + Aus + EU + Norway + Japan) output remains negligible — China still accounts for ~98% of primary supply ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/20819d8e-5d2b-4a12-9a50-edbfd07336ef#:~:text=China%20controls%2098,ore%2C%20mining%20for%20it%20became)).  Global mine output is ~760 t/yr ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gallium-lens-chinas-minerals-dominance-how-break-it-andy-home-2025-05-09/#:~:text=have%20more%20than%20doubled%2C%20highlighting,1)), so allied domestic share today is well under 10% of the world total.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Demand among the US and allied nations is expected to grow substantially by 2030, driven by expanding GaAs/GaN usage (5G, satellite, EV power electronics, radar).  Gallium is used almost exclusively in electronics (>95% of demand) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=Extremely%20high,gallium%20is%20used%20in%20optoelectronics)).  Assuming global demand (~760 t/yr today ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gallium-lens-chinas-minerals-dominance-how-break-it-andy-home-2025-05-09/#:~:text=have%20more%20than%20doubled%2C%20highlighting,1))) grows with semiconductor production (roughly 5–10%/yr), total demand by 2030 might approach on the order of 1,200–1,500 t/yr.  The US/EU/Japan fraction of this could be on the order of hundreds of tons per year; for example, FT notes that US-based refineries (e.g. in Tennessee) could theoretically meet “most of US demand” if reactivated ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/20819d8e-5d2b-4a12-9a50-edbfd07336ef#:~:text=encouraging%20US%20refineries%20to%20resume,ash%20and%20substituting%20toxic%20gallium)).  (By comparison, a UBS analysis estimated that halting Chinese Ga exports would impose a ~$3.1 billion impact on the US chip/E-mobility sector ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gallium-lens-chinas-minerals-dominance-how-break-it-andy-home-2025-05-09/#:~:text=Since%20China%20imposed%20export%20restrictions,1)), implying sustained substantial western Ga usage.)  In summary, US/allies demand by 2030 is likely in the low hundreds of metric tons yearly, scaling up from today’s ~760 t global baseline as GaN chips proliferate ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/gallium-lens-chinas-minerals-dominance-how-break-it-andy-home-2025-05-09/#:~:text=have%20more%20than%20doubled%2C%20highlighting,1)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/20819d8e-5d2b-4a12-9a50-edbfd07336ef#:~:text=encouraging%20US%20refineries%20to%20resume,ash%20and%20substituting%20toxic%20gallium)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Planned new projects will provide the majority of allied domestic output by 2030. Major contributors include:  
• **Canada (Rio Tinto/Indium Corp, Quebec):** Planned output **~40 t/yr** (up to 5–10% of global supply ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-extracts-first-gallium-under-collaboration-with-indium-2025-05-07/#:~:text=to%2040%20tonnes%20of%20gallium,reduce%20dependence%20on%20Chinese%20exports))).  Rio’s metallurgical plant in Québec has demonstrated pilot recovery; if scaled, it will be a substantial North American source ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-extracts-first-gallium-under-collaboration-with-indium-2025-05-07/#:~:text=to%2040%20tonnes%20of%20gallium,reduce%20dependence%20on%20Chinese%20exports)).  
• **EU – Greece (Metlen Energy & Metals, Agios Nikolaos):** Projected **~50 t/yr** by 2027 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c99de1a69863092fb40731a08f592e0d#:~:text=comerciales%20con%20China,productos%20sofisticados%20como%20veh%C3%ADculos%20el%C3%A9ctricos)).  This is funded under EU critical-minerals initiatives to extract Ga from bauxite refinery streams.  
• **Other Allied sources:**  Minor contributions could come from recycled scrap (electronics waste) or small-scale recovery at zinc smelters or coal-ash processors.  Japan and Australia have no announced primary projects; their supply will remain import-based.  
• **US:** No announced primary production.  Any US supply in 2030 would likely be co-production at an alumina refinery or galvanizing plant, but none is confirmed. (Indium Corp could potentially commercialize some recovery from US aluminum dross, but quantities are only a few tons.)  
• **Total supply (US + allies):** Summing announced projects yields on the order of **90–100 t/yr** by 2030 (40 t Canada + 50 t Greece).  This covers only ~10–15% of projected allied demand, underscoring continued import reliance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rio-tinto-extracts-first-gallium-under-collaboration-with-indium-2025-05-07/#:~:text=to%2040%20tonnes%20of%20gallium,reduce%20dependence%20on%20Chinese%20exports)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/c99de1a69863092fb40731a08f592e0d#:~:text=comerciales%20con%20China,productos%20sofisticados%20como%20veh%C3%ADculos%20el%C3%A9ctricos)).

ERG Kazakhstan (non-allied) ~15 t/yr from 2026 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/erg-plans-produce-critical-mineral-gallium-kazakhstan-next-year-2025-06-23/#:~:text=Union,China%20banned%20exports%20of%20gallium)) (for OECD export).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping (Bauxite & Zinc):** Since gallium occurs only in trace amounts (often 50–100 ppm) in **bauxite (aluminum ore)** and **zinc ores (sphalerite)** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=Gallium%20is%20produced%20exclusively%20as,coals%20were%20an%20important%20source)), exploration targets are existing Al and Zn provinces.  For example, mapping of tropical/paleo-weathered bauxite deposits (e.g. Guinea, Australia) or Mississippi Valley/SEDEX zinc deposits can flag Ga potential.  Geologists look for highly aluminous rock sequences and zinc-lead sulfide veins, because Ga commonly substitutes for Al or Fe in those minerals ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=Gallium%20is%20produced%20exclusively%20as,coals%20were%20an%20important%20source)).  
• **Geochemical Sampling:** Systematic soil/stream sediment sampling in and around bauxite mines or zinc mining areas is key.  Analysts measure Ga (and cofactors like Al, Fe, Ga/Al ratios) using ICP-MS on samples.  Elevated Ga in red mud (bauxite residue) or zinc tailings can highlight producible ore.  For example, after processing a bauxite ore, the NaOH Bayer liquor and red mud streams can be assayed for Ga to assess target concentration.  
• **Coal/Industrial Waste Surveys:** Historically, Ga was recovered from coal and coal ash in some regions. Modern prospectors may analyze **coal seam residues** and **fly ash** (e.g., Appalachian coal ashes) for Ga content.  Similarly, alumina refinery red mud or zinc smelter slag is assayed before process modifications.  Any known occurrence of Ga in industrial by–products prompts further exploration.  
• **Data Analytics of Existing Deposits:** Using mining databases and geologic models, companies can “rediscover” gallium by re-evaluating known Al/Zn projects for Ga content.  Example: modeling of bauxite plants yields estimates (bauxite often contains ~50 ppm Ga ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=%28i,kilogram%20in%202016%20and%20%24135%E2%80%93140))), so data-driven targeting is a discovery tool.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Bayer Process Ion-Exchange:** In alumina refineries, gallium accumulates in the spent caustic (NaOH) liquor.  Modern practice is to install **ion-exchange columns** (strong-base resins) to adsorb Ga from this Bayer liquor ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=During%20the%20processing%20of%20bauxite,it%20is%20further%20purified%20with)).  Typical Bayer feed Ga ~50 ppm, so one pass yields ~15% recovery ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=During%20the%20processing%20of%20bauxite,it%20is%20further%20purified%20with)). The Ga-loaded resin is then eluted (for example with HCl) to produce a concentrated Ga solution.  
• **Precipitation and Solvent Extraction:** After elution, Ga is separated from other metals.  For instance, adjusting pH (or adding chemicals) can precipitate gallium hydroxide selectively.  Alternatively, **solvent extraction** can strip Ga: organophosphorus extractants (like D2EHPA/Cyanex-302) or 7-alkyl-8-hydroxyquinoline complexes have been used to pull Ga from aqueous streams ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5102512A/fr#:~:text=marketed%20under%20the%20name%20of,C)).  These steps concentrate Ga into a manageable solution.  
• **Leaching of Zinc/Coal Residues:** Gallium can be leached from zinc smelter residues or coal ash using strong acids (e.g. HCl/H2SO4 with H2O2). The leachate (containing Ga³⁺) is then processed via ion-exchange or solvent extraction as above.  (Note: this is mainly experimental; commercial Ga is almost entirely from bauxite liquor.)  
• **Electrowinning of Metallic Ga:** The final extraction step is electrolysis.  Gallium is deposited from solution (e.g. GaCl₃ or Ga₂(SO₄)₃ in acid) onto cathodes ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=Gallium%20is%20removed%20from%20the,are%20routinely%20achieved%20and%20commercially)).  Low-current electrowinning yields crude “tech-grade” gallium metal.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Organic Solvent Extraction:** After dissolving gallium, liquid–liquid extraction separates Ga from iron/aluminum.  As noted in patents, chelating solvents such as **7-hydroxyquinoline (“Kelex 100”)** or complexing agents (e.g. tributyl phosphate) grab Ga selectively ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5102512A/fr#:~:text=marketed%20under%20the%20name%20of,C)).  Multiple extraction/stripping stages achieve high separation factors, allowing Ga to be recovered virtually free of Fe/Al.  
• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:** Alternately, strong-base ion resins (Chelex or custom polymers) can selectively bind Ga³⁺ when loaded after stripping.  Controlled pH steps then elute Ga while retaining impurities.  This is used to polish Ga from mixed feeds (for example, removing trace Zn, Cu).  
• **Precipitation Steps:**  Careful pH control can precipitate Ga(OH)₃ or Ga-oxalates at points where other metals remain soluble.  E.g., adjusting to pH ~3 precipitates Ga(OH)₃ but not Al(OH)₃ (pH ~4–5).  Sequential precipitation/crystallization is used in lab-scale separation.  
• **Membrane and Ion-Sieve Techniques:** Emerging methods include chelating membranes or imprinted polymers that selectively let Ga pass.  These are still R&D (e.g. ionic-liquid impregnation of Kyogel) but promise lower reagent use.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Zone Refining:** Crude gallium metal (often >99%) is further purified by zone melting.  A narrow molten zone is passed along a Ga ingot, segregating impurities at one end.  This can produce Ga ≥99.9999% (6N+ pure) routinely ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=Gallium%20is%20removed%20from%20the,are%20routinely%20achieved%20and%20commercially)).  
• **Single-Crystal Growth (Czochralski):** Ultra-high-purity gallium can be grown as single crystals by pulling from a melt ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=Gallium%20is%20removed%20from%20the,are%20routinely%20achieved%20and%20commercially)).  This yields Ga boules used in nanoscale doping and pure compound semiconductors.  It removes metallic inclusions and heterogeneities.  
• **Vacuum Distillation:** Gallium’s high boiling point (2206 K) permits high-temperature vacuum distillation.  Specialized distillation furnaces can separate volatile impurities.  In practice, Ga can be distilled under vacuum to remove residual organics or metals with higher vapor pressures.  
• **Electrolytic Upgrading:** Re-electrolysis in ultra-pure electrolytes can polish gallium.  For example, re-dissolve Ga metal in HCl and re-electrodeposit using inert cathodes to strip out tramp elements.  This electrolytic loop is sometimes used as a final purification polish.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Waste Neutralization:** Gallium extraction generates alkaline and acidic effluents (from Bayer liquor or acid leaching).  Neutralization (e.g. CO₂ or lime dosing) precipitates Ga(OH)₃ along with Al/Fe hydroxides, purging metals from wastewater.  The solid is then handled as waste or recycled for residual metals.  
• **Red Mud Utilization:** Bauxite residue (“red mud”) still contains ~85% of the gallium after one recovery pass ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=During%20the%20processing%20of%20bauxite,it%20is%20further%20purified%20with)).  New processes aim to extract more Ga from red mud (for example, high-pressure alkaline leaching) to minimize waste.  Meanwhile, treated red mud is stabilized into bricks/construction fill to contain any leachable metals.  
• **Metal Adsorption and Filtration:** Waste streams with low concentrations of Ga (e.g. rinse waters) can be treated with activated carbon or ion-exchange filters to capture dissolved gallium, preventing environmental release.  Spent filters are then regenerated or recycled.  
• **E-waste Recycling:** Though not “remediation” per se, urban mining of electronics (e.g. LED scrap, GaAs chips) is a growing source.  Hydrometallurgical recycling facilities use acid/base leach plus solvent extraction to recover gallium from scrap.  This reduces dependance on ore-derived Ga and prevents toxic waste.

Key extraction patents (e.g. US5102512A) describe processes “for extracting and purifying gallium from Bayer liquors” using ion exchange and solvent extraction. The RSC review notes gallium recovery from industrial wastes ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=accounted%20for%20more%20than%20half,primary%20gallium%20in%20North%20America)).

Recent research (e.g. Dalton Trans. 2020) explores ionic-liquid–dissolved extractants for Bayer liquors, validating long-used chemistry.

The USGS report “Gallium: A Smart Metal” and patents detail multi-stage refinement.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The principal bottleneck is **gallium recovery from existing waste streams**, not ore scarcity.  Gallium’s host materials (bauxite/zinc) are abundant, but capture requires specialized processing.  In practice, **ion-exchange/solvent-extraction lines in alumina refineries** are the bottleneck: without these, ~85% of Ga remains locked in red mud ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=During%20the%20processing%20of%20bauxite,it%20is%20further%20purified%20with)).  No U.S./EU alumina plant currently has a full-scale gallium recovery system, so raw resource is underutilized.  FT observers note that U.S. “facilities in Tennessee” (historically used for germanium/Ga) could meet most domestic demand if reactivated ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/20819d8e-5d2b-4a12-9a50-edbfd07336ef#:~:text=encouraging%20US%20refineries%20to%20resume,for%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20another)).  Thus, the lack of installed extraction technology (and capital for it) is the key bottleneck. 

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Despite abundant gallium in mined bauxite (≥50 ppm), nearly all Ga still goes un-recovered in conventional Bayer refining ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=During%20the%20processing%20of%20bauxite,it%20is%20further%20purified%20with)). The bottleneck is inadequate processing capacity: allied countries lack operational Ga-specific extraction plants. In other words, **the limiting factor is technology and infrastructure, not geology**.  Building or retrofitting refining facilities (ion-exchange plants, electrolysis cells, etc.) is essential; without it, US/allies will remain import-dependent for hundreds of tons of annual gallium demand ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/20819d8e-5d2b-4a12-9a50-edbfd07336ef#:~:text=encouraging%20US%20refineries%20to%20resume,for%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20another)) ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium#:~:text=During%20the%20processing%20of%20bauxite,it%20is%20further%20purified%20with)).
