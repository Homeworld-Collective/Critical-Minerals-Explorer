## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: HPAL processing; battery-grade refining; sulfide ore beneficiation*  

Western (US and allied) nickel output is overwhelmingly from sulfide ores without downstream conversion to battery-grade products.  In practice, virtually all Western nickel refining yields metal for stainless/alloy markets, whereas China and Indonesia dominate the new Class-1 nickel sulfate supply for batteries.  For example, Westwin Elements’ proposed Oklahoma refinery – the only full-scale North American plant to make battery-grade nickel sulfate – is still under development ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rural-oklahoma-strives-become-american-hub-critical-minerals-processing-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Oklahoma%20is%20positioning%20itself%20as,friendly%20policies)).  Similarly, there are no US or Canadian high-pressure acid leach (HPAL) plants: Indonesia’s Vale Sulawesi project will spend ~$1.9 billion to build a 60 kt/yr HPAL plant converting laterites into mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indonesia-says-nickel-miner-vale-build-another-2-bln-hpal-plant-2024-03-18/#:~:text=Indonesian%20nickel%20miner%20PT%20Vale,Vale%20Indonesia%20is%20currently%20finalizing)).  By contrast, China/Indonesia currently control roughly three-quarters of nickel sulfate output ([fpxnickel.com](https://fpxnickel.com/news/fpx-nickel-scoping-study-for-north-americas-largest-nickel-sulphate-refinery-outlines-low-cost-and-low-carbon-supply-for-the-ev-battery-supply-chain/#:~:text=According%20to%20Benchmark%E2%80%99s%20database%2C%20the,North%20American%20nickel%20sulphate%20production)) and most new HPAL capacity ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rural-oklahoma-strives-become-american-hub-critical-minerals-processing-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Oklahoma%20is%20positioning%20itself%20as,friendly%20policies)) ([www.industry.gov.au](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/resources-and-energy-quarterly-september-2023#:~:text=,market%20during%20the%20outlook%20period)).  Establishing integrated HPAL–refinery complexes in the West would require multi-billion-dollar investment and 5–7 years of development, creating a strategic gap in the battery supply chain ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indonesia-says-nickel-miner-vale-build-another-2-bln-hpal-plant-2024-03-18/#:~:text=Indonesian%20nickel%20miner%20PT%20Vale,Vale%20Indonesia%20is%20currently%20finalizing)) ([fpxnickel.com](https://fpxnickel.com/news/fpx-nickel-scoping-study-for-north-americas-largest-nickel-sulphate-refinery-outlines-low-cost-and-low-carbon-supply-for-the-ev-battery-supply-chain/#:~:text=According%20to%20Benchmark%E2%80%99s%20database%2C%20the,North%20American%20nickel%20sulphate%20production)).  In summary, the lack of Western capacity to convert laterite or sulfide feedstock into battery-grade (Class 1) nickel sulfate is the key bottleneck for allied EV battery supply chains ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rural-oklahoma-strives-become-american-hub-critical-minerals-processing-2025-06-18/#:~:text=Oklahoma%20is%20positioning%20itself%20as,friendly%20policies)) ([fpxnickel.com](https://fpxnickel.com/news/fpx-nickel-scoping-study-for-north-americas-largest-nickel-sulphate-refinery-outlines-low-cost-and-low-carbon-supply-for-the-ev-battery-supply-chain/#:~:text=According%20to%20Benchmark%E2%80%99s%20database%2C%20the,North%20American%20nickel%20sulphate%20production)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: ~350,000 tons/yr total allied production*  

• **United States** – ≈17,000 t Ni (2023).  USGS data show only the Eagle nickel–copper mine (Michigan) is operating, with ~15–18 kt/yr Ni (contained) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  This accounts for about 0.5% of global nickel output ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  All other US nickel production (e.g. former Montana complexes) is now closed or on care-and-maintenance.  

• **Canada** – ~158,700 t (2023).  According to Natural Resources Canada, 2023 Canadian nickel mine output was 158,668 t, a ~9% increase from 2022 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=,8%20billion%20in%202023)).  Canada is the world’s #6 producer (≈4–5% of global production ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7))), with major sulfide mines in Ontario (Sudbury), Québec (Raglan), Newfoundland & Labrador (Voisey’s Bay), and Manitoba (Thompson).  Ontario alone produced ~62.5 kt (Masabie and other Sudbury–Thompson district mines), Newfoundland ~42.9 kt (Voisey’s Bay), Québec ~42.4 kt (Raglan), and Manitoba ~10.8 kt (Thompson) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=Canadian%20mine%20production%20of%20nickel%2C,100.0)). These operations are expected to continue through the 2030s.  

• **Australia** – ~160,000 t (2023).  Latest Australian data (Geoscience Australia) place 2023 nickel production at ~160 kt ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  Major projects include BHP’s Nickel West (Western Australia) and IGO’s Nova (WA) mine (~77 kt and ~25 kt Ni/yr, respectively), plus other RKEF laterite lines.  (BHP and others recently idled or curtailed extra operations due to low prices ([www.industry.gov.au](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/resources-and-energy-quarterly-september-2023#:~:text=,market%20during%20the%20outlook%20period)).)  Australia was the world’s #5 producer before recent market-­driven cutbacks.  

• **European Union (Finland)** – ≈30,000 t/yr.  Finland’s Terrafame sulfide operation is the EU’s only significant nickel mine, with recent output on the order of 30 kt Ni ([www.terrafame.com](https://www.terrafame.com/newsroom/media-releases/terrafame-2023-the-operating-result-decreased-in-a-challenging-market-but-basic-production-continued-close-to-a-record-level.html?p461=3#:~:text=The%20volume%20of%20basic%20production,capability%20of%20our%20production%20and)) (byproduct of zinc tailings bioleaching).  (France’s New Caledonia mines are overseas territories, not EU.)  

• **Norway, Iceland, Japan** – ~0 t.  Norway’s last nickel mine (Bruvann) closed in 2002; Iceland has no nickel mines; Japan has no domestic nickel resources and is fully import-dependent.  

Overall, US+allied production totals roughly 350 kt Ni/yr today (primarily Canada and Australia) – a small fraction of global output (~3.6 Mt ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7))).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 1,200,000–1,500,000 tons/yr projected demand*  

• **Total Allied Demand (2030)** – roughly 1.2–1.4 Mt Ni/yr.  Global demand for nickel could reach ~4.7–5.0 Mt by 2030 under current policies (IEA estimates ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-critical-minerals-outlook-2025/executive-summary#:~:text=Demand%20for%20key%20energy%20minerals,growth%20over%20the%20same%20period))).  Historically Western economies (US, EU, Japan, Canada, Australia) consume ~25–30% of global nickel.  Applying that range to 4.7 Mt gives ~1.2–1.4 Mt Ni/yr for allied markets by 2030.  The main drivers are batteries and stainless steel.  

• **Electric Vehicles (Battery Nickel)** – ~600–700 kt/yr.  EV growth (especially high-nickel cathodes like NMC-811 and NCA) is projected to soak up a large share of Western nickel.  Industry forecasts (Wood Mackenzie, Benchmark) had pegged global battery-grade Ni demand at ~1.5–1.6 Mt by 2030, though recent market shifts to LFP chemistry have lowered that (newer forecasts ~0.97 Mt ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nickel-oversupply-persist-expansion-slower-demand-growth-industry-experts-say-2025-06-05/#:~:text=has%20weakened%20due%20to%20a,and%20demand%20to%20support%20prices))).  Assuming ~40–45% of battery Ni demand comes from Western vehicles, Western EVs could consume on the order of 600–700 kt Ni/yr by 2030.  (For context, Tesla’s NMC-based cathodes today contain 60–80% Ni by metal.)  

• **Stainless Steel & Alloys** – ~550–600 kt/yr.  Western steel and alloy sectors remain the largest nickel consumers.  In 2023, about 70% of global nickel use (roughly 1.9–2.0 Mt) went into 300-series stainless steel ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=,global%20nickel%20consumption%20in%202023)).  Western stainless output (US, EU, Japan, etc.) will require on the order of 550–600 kt Ni/yr by 2030, at moderate growth rates.  Additional smaller demands from superalloys, plating, and catalysts may add tens of kilotonnes.  

• **Regional Breakdown (2030 est.)** – On a rough basis [% of allied usage]: US ~250–300 kt, EU+UK ~500–600 kt, Japan ~150–200 kt, Canada ~30–40 kt, Australia ~30–40 kt.  (These estimates combine steel and battery sectors and reflect current non-Chinese consumption patterns.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 300,000–400,000 tons/yr projected supply*  

• **United States** – ≈18,000 t/yr.  With no new mines expected by 2030, US nickel output will remain essentially limited to the Eagle Mine (15–18 kt Ni/yr until its scheduled closure ~2026 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7))).  Two proposed Minnesota sulphide projects (NorthMet and Twin Metals) face permitting delays and are unlikely to produce by 2030.  

• **Canada** – ~140,000–150,000 t/yr.  Existing Canadian sulfide mines have reserves into the 2030s.  Total output may edge up slightly via expansions, but no major new mines are scheduled to start before 2030.  (Emerging projects like Crawford and Dumont have long lead times.)  Canada’s 2030 production is thus expected to stay in the 140–150 kt range, mainly from Voisey’s Bay, Raglan, Sudbury, and Thompson.  

• **Australia** – ~100,000–150,000 t/yr.  Australia’s production outlook is uncertain due to recent shutdowns.  Base case: established mines (BHP Nickel West, IGO Nova) continue (~100 kt), and if nickel prices recover, some care-and-maintenance projects (e.g. Ravensthorpe, Murrin Murrin) may restart.  Potential new starter (Ardea’s Goongarrie) might contribute late in the decade.  Overall, forecast ~100–150 kt/yr by 2030.  

• **European Union (Finland)** – ~30,000 t/yr.  Terrafame’s nickel (sulfide) output is expected to continue ~30 kt/yr, possibly rising to ~40 kt if market conditions and financing allow planned expansions.  

• **Norway, Iceland, Japan** – 0 t/yr (no domestic production through 2030).  

• **Total (US+Allies)** – ~290,000–350,000 t/yr by 2030 (driven by Canada and Australia).  This would be only ~20–25% of the projected allied demand (~1.3 Mt), implying continued strong import reliance (predominantly from Indonesia, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian sources).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: airborne electromagnetics; geochemical sampling; magnetic surveys; seismic imaging*  

• **Geological mapping & geochemistry:** Targeting nickel deposits begins with classic field work.  Detailed mapping of ultramafic complexes, komatiite flows, and mafic–ultramafic intrusions (cratonic nickel belt lithologies) guides exploration (SEG 2023).  Soil, stream-sediment, and rock-chip geochemical surveys (multi-element ICP-MS) are standard.  Exploration often uses portable XRF for rapid field assays of Ni-Cu-PGE pathfinder elements (e.g. Cr, Co, Cu, PGEs).  Many Ni–Cu deposits (e.g. Noril’sk, Jinchuan, Raglan) were first hinted at by systematic geochemical anomalies ([pubs.geoscienceworld.org](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/books/edited-volume/2671/Magmatic-Ni-Cu-and-PGE-DepositsGeology#:~:text=GeoScienceWorld%20Books%20,on%3A%20GSW%20Google%20Scholar%20Edward)).  In tropical laterite terrains, even biogeochemical sampling (e.g. vegetation or termite mounds) can flag deep nickel anomalies.  Standard multi-element geochem often includes Ni, Cu, Co, Cr, PGE (Pd, Pt), and others.  

• **Airborne electromagnetics (AEM):** Time-domain EM surveys (VTEM, SkyTEM, HeliTEM) are cornerstone tools for sulfide nickel exploration.  These cover large areas efficiently, detecting subcropping or blind conductive sulfide bodies to ~300–500 m depth ([pubs.geoscienceworld.org](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/books/edited-volume/2671/Magmatic-Ni-Cu-and-PGE-DepositsGeology#:~:text=GeoScienceWorld%20Books%20,on%3A%20GSW%20Google%20Scholar%20Edward)).  AEM has such fine resolution that significant Ni–Cu discoveries (e.g. Voisey’s Bay in 1993) followed up VTEM conductor anomalies.  Modern systems can resolve late-time (deep) conductors at ~10–20 m depth increments, aiding “downward continuation” models of massive sulfide plates.  

• **Aeromagnetics & gravity:** High-resolution aeromagnetic surveys (line spacing ~50–100 m) delineate ultramafic intrusions (often magnetic) and structures (folds, faults) that localize Ni mineralization.  Combined EM–magnetic data help isolate conductor–host relationships.  Gravity surveys (large-footprint ground or airborne) can also detect dense sulfide or gabbroic bodies (e.g. Gravity lows/high-density associated with Noril’sk/PGE orebodies).  In covered terrains, 3D seismic reflection (although expensive) has been successfully applied in places like Sudbury and Noril’sk to image salt-domes/granite-related ore zones at 1–2 km depth.  

• **Ground geophysics:** Follow-up of airborne anomalies often uses ground EM (GeoTEM, VTEM after-flight, HLEM) for tighter conductor mapping, and induced polarization (IP) surveys for disseminated sulfides.  Borehole EM (DHEM) is routinely deployed to vector from a drilled conductor intersection toward off-hole targets.  

• **Remote sensing & geoinformatics:** Satellite hyperspectral data (ASTER, WorldView-3) plus airborne imaging can map alteration zones (e.g. laterite nickel-landforms, ultramafic contacts).  Geophysics integrated with geological GIS helps target concealed ore.  For lateritic Ni, ultramafic host zones can be mapped under tropical cover by geophysics+remote sensing.  Notably, in tropical Africa and Australia, exploration includes innovative geochemistry (elemental enrichments in termite mounds) and vegetation proxies for deeply buried Ni laterites.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: sulfide flotation; RKEF smelting; HPAL; heap leaching*  

• **Nickel Sulfide Ore Processing:** Standard processing of massive nickel sulfide (and Ni–Cu–Co–PGE) ores involves crushing/grinding and froth flotation to concentrate the sulfides (typically to 8–20% Ni in concentrate) ([pubs.geoscienceworld.org](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/books/edited-volume/2671/Magmatic-Ni-Cu-and-PGE-DepositsGeology#:~:text=GeoScienceWorld%20Books%20,on%3A%20GSW%20Google%20Scholar%20Edward)).  Advances in reagent chemistry (xanthate, dithiophosphate collectors) and finely tuned stage-grinding allow >90% Ni recovery.  Concentrate then goes to matte smelting: either flash smelting (Outotec/Kennecott process) or electric furnace smelting produces a matte (40–70% Ni) plus byproduct copper and precious metals.  The matte is further refined (e.g. Pfroehler, Norilsk processes or hydrometallurgy) to nickel metal, cobalt, and copper (see section on Purification).  

• **Ferronickel (FeNi) Smelting (Rotary Kiln–Electric Furnace, RKEF):** Saprolitic laterite ores (~1.5–2.5% Ni) are smelted in RKEF trains (rotary kilns + EAFs) to produce ferronickel or NPI (20–40% Ni alloy).  Operating at ~1450–1600 °C with coke or coal reductant, RKEF typically recovers ~80–90% Ni from saprolites.  Indonesia and China operate over 100 RKEF lines, producing roughly 1.5 Mt Ni/yr in FeNi/NPI form ([www.industry.gov.au](https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/resources-and-energy-quarterly-september-2023#:~:text=,market%20during%20the%20outlook%20period)).  The per-unit capital cost is moderate but CO₂-intensive and unsuitable for cobalt-rich limonites.  

• **High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL):** Limonite-rich laterites (0.8–1.5% Ni, high Fe/Al) are processed in HPAL autoclaves (~250–270 °C, 40–50 bar) with concentrated sulfuric acid ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indonesia-says-nickel-miner-vale-build-another-2-bln-hpal-plant-2024-03-18/#:~:text=Indonesian%20nickel%20miner%20PT%20Vale,Vale%20Indonesia%20is%20currently%20finalizing)).  This hydrometallurgical route solubilizes Ni, Co (and Mg, Fe) to give a Ni/Co sulfate liquor.  Well-engineered HPAL plants achieve >90% Ni and ~95% Co recoveries.  Existing large-scale HPAL plants include Taganito and Coral Bay (Philippines) and Indonesia’s Weda Bay and others (joint venture of MIND ID, CBL, etc.).  HPAL is capital-intensive ($30,000–35,000 per t Ni capacity ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indonesia-says-nickel-miner-vale-build-another-2-bln-hpal-plant-2024-03-18/#:~:text=Indonesian%20nickel%20miner%20PT%20Vale,Vale%20Indonesia%20is%20currently%20finalizing))) and complex to operate, but it produces Ni in solution form ready for sulfate conversion.  

• **Atmospheric and Heap Leaching (AL/HL):** Lower-grade limonitic ores can be leached at atmospheric pressure.  Techniques like SNCL’s Direct Nickel (DNi) and heap leaching (sulfuric acid heap) aim to extract ~60–85% of Ni at lower cost.  These methods involve agglomeration of ore on heap pads or continuous stirred reactors.  While simpler than HPAL, recoveries and leach rates are lower.  Several projects (Sudbury’s Kambalda style, Chinese test plants) have tried heap leach, but only a few pilot/commercial units exist globally.  

• **Bioleaching:** Certain Ni sulfide ores or tailings can be bio-oxidized by bacteria (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus*).  Finland’s Terrafame (ex-Talvivaara) pioneered heap bioleaching of zinc tailings, extracting Ni and Co by circulating acidic solution over biomasses.  Bioleaching is energy-efficient and low-cost but slow (months–years) and typically used in very low-grade or tailings.  Developments in microbial consortia and agitation reactor bioleaching are ongoing to improve rates.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: solvent extraction; ion exchange; selective precipitation; crystallization*  

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The central hydrometallurgical method for Ni–Co separation.  In a typical HPAL flowsheet, the Ni/Co sulfate liquor is first stripped of iron/Al then processed through sequential SX circuits.  Nome® (2-ethyhexanol based) or Carberry (Cyanex 272) extractants are used.  Co/Zn/Mn are extracted first at pH ~3–4, then Ni is extracted at pH ~5–6 with D2EHPA (P204) or Versatic 10.  Modern SX stages (mixer-settlers or columns) achieve >99% separation efficiency.  SX allows rejection of Mg by careful pH control, producing a purified Co stream (to carbonate) and a Ni-laden strip solution (~100–250 g/L Ni).  

• **Ion Exchange (IX):** Chelating ion-exchange resins (e.g. Lewatit TP207 or Purolite S930) can selectively adsorb Ni^2+ (or other metals) from dilute or moderate-concentration sulfate solutions.  IX is often used after SX polishing, or for tailings neutralization effluent cleanup (<50 ppm Ni target).  New “molecular recognition” resins (MRT) have been developed for Ni–Co with very high selectivity.  In slurry applications, resin-in-pulp (RIP) or resin-in-leach (RIL) can capture Ni directly from slurries.  Ion exchange can leave <1 ppm Ni in final wash liquors.  

• **Mixed Hydroxide Precipitation (MHP):** In HPAL flowsheets, purified Ni-Co strip liquor is sometimes neutralized (e.g. with MgO or CaO) to precipitate a mixed Ni-Co hydroxide.  This MHP (35–40% Ni+Co) is a transportable intermediate (often shipped to re­­finers in Asia).  MHP plants (e.g. in Indonesia/Philippines) simply close-circuit N/CaO just before final Ni SX, integrating with main flowsheet.  MHP recovery (~95% Ni, high Co) is achieved by careful pH control (~10).  

• **Sulfide Precipitation:** Highly selective sulfide precipitation (H₂S or NaHS) is used to recover Ni as a solid from purification circuits (e.g. from Cu stripping raffinate).  Sulfide precipitation yields a NiS concentrate (>55% Ni) that is easily filtered.  Advanced processes (Outotec’s VS, METSX, etc.) are tuned to drop Ni (and Co) ahead of Zn/Mg precipitation, yielding >99% Ni removal.  This is often the final step before recrystallizing Ni sulfate.  

• **Crystallization:** Battery-grade nickel sulfate (NiSO₄·6H₂O) is produced by crystallization (cooling or evaporation) from a highly purified Ni solution (~250 g/L Ni).  Crystallizers (etagres, draft-tube) are operated under inert to avoid contamination.  Battery spec: >22% Ni, with <5 ppm Fe, <10 ppm Cu and Zn, and strict limits on Mn/Co/Na.  A typical refinery will crystallize to meet, for instance, Tesla or LG Chem cathode material specs.  Alternatively, direct crystallization to Ni carbonate or interdiction (nickel hydroxycarbonate) is done when producing Ni chemical.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: electrowinning; carbonyl refining; hydrogen reduction; sulfate crystallization*  

• **Electrowinning (EW):** Mature technology for producing high-purity nickel metal.  Purified sulfate liquor (20–100 g/L Ni, pH ~3–4) is electrolyzed in large cells (55–65 °C, ~2.3–2.5 V).  Modern plants use full-plate or cylindrical cathodes with high current densities (200–300 A/m²), achieving >99.9% Ni.  Notable EW refineries: Glencore’s Nikkelverk (Norway), Sherritt (Canada), Vale (Brazil) (though later moved to SRZ chloride).  In North America, smaller EW units exist (e.g. in Fort Saskatchewan AB by Sherritt’s NiRidge).  

• **Carbonyl Refining:** Produces ultra-high-purity nickel (99.99%) as pellets or powder.  Feed (Nickel metal or matte) reacts with CO to form volatile Ni(CO)₄ gas at ~50 °C; on heating to ~200 °C, Ni metal crystallizes out as fine powder/pellets and CO is recycled.  Vale’s Kokkola/Clydach (Finland/UK) and Long Harbour (Canada) use carbonyl refining.  This yields Ni of electronics/alloy grade (<1 ppm impurities).  

• **Hydrogen Reduction:** Reduction of nickel oxide or hydroxide in a hydrogen atmosphere (typically 400–500 °C) yields nickel metal powder or briquettes.  Used for products like powder metallurgy Ni (e.g. Sherritt’s Fort Saskatchewan Ni powder plant).  Scale is smaller; main use is specialty.  Reaction: NiO + H₂ → Ni + H₂O.  

• **Nickel Sulfate Production:** For batteries, Ni metal or matte is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid, purified (removing Fe, Cu, etc.), and crystallized to NiSO₄·6H₂O.  Purification often uses SX (Versatic, P204) or ion exchange, followed by Mg precipitation to remove Fe, Cu, Ca.  The final crystallization yields >22% Ni content, with particle specs.  Leading producers include Jinchuan (China), Sumitomo (Japan), Umicore (Belgium) – though most production is in Asia.  Western cells via project like Westwin (OK) aim to establish domestic Ni sulfate plants.  

• **Matte Refining:** Sulfide nickel matte (40–70% Ni) can be refined hydrometallurgically (avoiding smelters).  E.g., Sherritt–Gordon ammonia-leach (CO₂–NH₃ converting matte to Ni metal + (NH₄)₂SO₄ Co byproduct), or Outotec chloride process (matte chlorination at high T then leach).  These produce Ni metal and capture cobalt without SO₂ emissions.  While used historically (Long Harbour, Rankin, NiCAN), new matte refineries (e.g. Eramet’s NYRHEX) are reviving hydromet routes.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: acid neutralization; metal precipitation; tailings management; phytoremediation*  

• **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Treatment:** Sulfidic nickel and copper tailings can generate acid runoff.  Active treatment uses lime or limestone to neutralize AMD, raising pH to ~8.5–9.5, precipitating Ni/Cu/Fe hydroxides.  Modern plants often use high-density sludge (HDS) clarification to thicken metal hydroxide sludges, reducing waste volume by ~90%.  Passive systems (e.g. anoxic limestone drains, sulfate-reducing bioreactors) can also attenuate Ni drains.  Treatment goals: reduce effluent Ni to <1–2 mg/L.  

• **Metal Recovery from Waste Streams:** Technologies recover Ni from dilute solutions (e.g. tailings impoundment seepage, process effluents).  Ion-exchange or ligand-exchange resins can concentrate Ni from <100 ppm streams.  Emerging electrochemical methods (selective electrodes, ED/EF cells) can strip Ni with high efficiency.  Molecular Recognition Technology (MRT) resins have demonstrated >95% Ni recovery from plating wastewaters.  These methods not only avoid Ni discharge but generate a Ni-rich product for recycling.  

• **Tailings Stabilization:** To prevent Ni oxidation, tailings can be managed by dry stacking (dewatering) to exclude oxygen, or by backfilling underground (paste backfill ~50–70% tailings with cement).  Covers using industrial byproducts (e.g. fly ash, bentonite liners, organic mulch) create anoxic barriers.  CO₂-consuming covers (e.g. compost layers) can also induce carbonate precipitation of metals.  The goal is long-term containment without AMD leakage.  

• **Phytoremediation/Agromining:** Certain plants (hyperaccumulators like *Alyssum*, *Berkheya*) selectively uptake Ni to high levels (1–3% Ni in dry biomass) when grown on ultramafic soils or contaminated sites.  Harvested biomass (“green ore”) can be processed to recover Ni (phytomining) ([pubs.geoscienceworld.org](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/segweb/books/edited-volume/2671/Magmatic-Ni-Cu-and-PGE-DepositsGeology#:~:text=GeoScienceWorld%20Books%20,on%3A%20GSW%20Google%20Scholar%20Edward)).  Field trials (Serbia, Australia) show potential Ni yield of 100–400 kg/ha/yr.  This not only cleans soil but generates saleable Ni.  Research on transgenic or optimized agronomy continues to improve yields.  

• **In-situ Stabilization:** Contaminated soils can be treated in place by adding amendments.  Biochar or zero-valent iron (ZVI) particles can immobilize Ni by adsorption or sulfide formation.  Alkaline amendments (lime, limestone) induce Ni hydroxide precipitation.  Phosphate fertilizers can precipitate Ni-phosphate minerals.  Field studies have achieved >90% reduction in leachable Ni after ZVI treatments.  

• **Biological Treatment:** Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in anaerobic bioreactors convert sulfate + organic matter to H₂S, precipitating Ni (and Cu, Zn) as insoluble sulfides.  Such passive/reactor systems can treat acidic mine waters to <0.5 mg/L Ni.  Constructed wetlands with Ni-tolerant plants (e.g. *Typha*, *Phragmites*) combined with limestone beds have also shown 70–90% Ni removal from mine effluents.
