## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States** – ~17 kt/yr (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  The only U.S. nickel mine is the Eagle nickel-copper mine (Lundin Mining) in Michigan, producing on the order of 15–20 kt Ni/year.  No other commercial nickel mines operate (U.S. Nickel output is only ~0.5% of world production ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7))).  (Former Ni-Cu mines in Wyoming and Alaska have long been closed.)  
• **Canada** – 158,668 t (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  Canada is a leading Ni producer (ranked 6th globally), with major sulfide operations in Ontario and Quebec.  For example, Vale’s Voisey’s Bay (NL) yielded ~39.7 kt Ni in 2022 and Glencore’s Raglan (QC) ~39.4 kt ([www.energymonitor.ai](https://www.energymonitor.ai/data-insights/the-five-largest-nickel-mines-in-operation-in-canada/#:~:text=The%20Voisey%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Mine%20is,Buy%20the%20profile%20here)), plus Glencore’s Sudbury (~18 kt) and Vale’s Thompson (~16 kt) ([www.energymonitor.ai](https://www.energymonitor.ai/data-insights/the-five-largest-nickel-mines-in-operation-in-canada/#:~:text=3)).  These large mines (operating into the 2030s ([www.energymonitor.ai](https://www.energymonitor.ai/data-insights/the-five-largest-nickel-mines-in-operation-in-canada/#:~:text=The%20Voisey%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Mine%20is,Buy%20the%20profile%20here)) ([www.energymonitor.ai](https://www.energymonitor.ai/data-insights/the-five-largest-nickel-mines-in-operation-in-canada/#:~:text=operate%20until%202035,profile%20here))) collectively produced about 160 kt in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)). Canada also refines ore at Sudbury/Thompson smelters.  
• **Australia** – 160,000 t (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  Australia is a top-5 Ni producer.  The largest mines are in Western Australia: Glencore’s Murrin Murrin (31.1 kt Ni in 2023) and IGO/OZ Minerals’ Nova (22.9 kt) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/five-largest-nickel-mines-australia/#:~:text=1)), plus First Quantum’s Ravensthorpe (22 kt) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/five-largest-nickel-mines-australia/#:~:text=3)).  These and several smaller mines (e.g. Spotted Quoll, Savannah) yield ~160 kt total ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  (BHP’s Nickle West operations in WA also produce class-2 Ni pig-iron/ferronickel.)  
• **European Union** – ~0 (negligible).  The only EU nickel mine (Terrafame/Talvivaara, Finland) is in care-and-maintenance and slated for controlled closure by end-2025 ([rawmaterials.news](https://rawmaterials.news/finland-government-prepares-for-talvivaara-nickel-mine-closure/#:~:text=The%20Finnish%20Government%20has%20determined,a%20press%20conference%20on%20Wednesday)).  No other active Ni mines exist in EU member states.  (France’s New Caledonia operations and Serbia’s mine are outside EU.)  
• **Norway** – 0.  Norway’s historic Ni mines (Flåt, Hosanger) closed by the 1940s, and the Rana (Bruvann) sulfide mine closed in 2001 ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/geologiske-ressurser/nickel-norway#:~:text=In%201989%20the%20Finnish%20company,operation%20which%20lasted%20until%202001)).  No nickel is presently mined in Norway.  
• **Iceland** – 0.  Iceland has known Ni occurrences but no commercial nickel mining.  
• **Japan** – 0.  Japan has no nickel mines and relies entirely on imports for its Ni needs (for stainless steel and batteries).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Total Allied Demand (2030)** – on the order of **1,200–1,500 kt/yr**.  In the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario, global nickel demand reaches ~4,754 kt by 2030 ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/nickel#:~:text=Cleantech%20demand%20%28kt%29%20%20,613)).  Western economies (US, Canada, Europe, Japan) account for roughly 25–30% of that total.  Thus, allied demand could approach ~1.2–1.4 Mt in 2030.  Key drivers are EV batteries and stainless steel.  
• **Electric Vehicles (Battery Ni)** – Western EV markets will dominate Ni growth. Benchmark forecasts battery-grade Ni demand to ~1,500 kt by 2030 ([quantum.platodata.ai](https://quantum.platodata.ai/nickel-demand-to-triple-by-2030-can-the-market-keep-up/#:~:text=,5%20million%20tonnes%20annually)) (recently revised to ~967 kt due to LFP competition ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nickel-oversupply-persist-expansion-slower-demand-growth-industry-experts-say-2025-06-05/#:~:text=viability%20of%20about%20half%20the,and%20demand%20to%20support%20prices))).  About 85% of new battery production outside China is Ni-based, so US/EU/JP EV batteries may consume **800–1,200 kt** Ni/year by 2030 ([quantum.platodata.ai](https://quantum.platodata.ai/nickel-demand-to-triple-by-2030-can-the-market-keep-up/#:~:text=Looking%20ahead%2C%20nickel,role%20as%20EV%20technology%20advances)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nickel-oversupply-persist-expansion-slower-demand-growth-industry-experts-say-2025-06-05/#:~:text=viability%20of%20about%20half%20the,and%20demand%20to%20support%20prices)).  (For reference, Tesla and other automakers are moving to NMC chemistries with ~80–90% Ni in the cathode.)  
• **Stainless Steel & Alloys** – Western steel and alloy sectors remain the base load (~65% of Western Ni goes into 300-series stainless steel ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/nickel-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Nickel%20is%20primarily%20sold%20for,between%20alloy%20steels%2C%20rechargeable%20batteries))).  Global stainless Ni demand is ~2.5 Mt today, growing slowly; Western portion of that is on the order of a few hundred kt of Ni.  Even with modest growth, US and EU industries will absorb **several hundred kt** of Ni by 2030 for stainless, plus additional Ni for superalloys, chemical uses, etc ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/nickel-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Nickel%20is%20primarily%20sold%20for,between%20alloy%20steels%2C%20rechargeable%20batteries)). Renium turbine blades and aerospace superalloys (Inconel, Waspaloy) also contribute.  
• **Regional Breakdown (2030 est.)** – Roughly: US ~200–300 kt/yr; EU (including Norway) ~~500–700 kt/yr; Japan ~~100–150 kt/yr; Canada ~~20–30 kt/yr; Australia ~~20–30 kt/yr.  These estimates combine steel and battery sectors.  (Detailed projections vary, but all point to multi‐hundred-kiloton demand for key allies.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States** – ~17 kt/yr (2023 level) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)). Without new deposits, US mined Ni will likely remain ≈15–20 kt by 2030 (Eagle Mine output). No new US projects are confirmed, so US domestic Ni supply will be minimal.  
• **Canada** – ~~160 kt/yr (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  Canada’s major mines (Voisey’s, Raglan, Sudbury, Thompson) are approved through the 2030s ([www.energymonitor.ai](https://www.energymonitor.ai/data-insights/the-five-largest-nickel-mines-in-operation-in-canada/#:~:text=The%20Voisey%E2%80%99s%20Bay%20Mine%20is,Buy%20the%20profile%20here)) ([www.energymonitor.ai](https://www.energymonitor.ai/data-insights/the-five-largest-nickel-mines-in-operation-in-canada/#:~:text=operate%20until%202035,profile%20here)), so output should stay near current levels (~150–160 kt).  However, without large new mines, domestic Canadian Ni supply will be roughly flat into 2030.  
• **Australia** – ~~160 kt/yr (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/nickel-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,10.7)).  Major Australian Ni mines (Murrin Murrin, Nova, Ravensthorpe, etc. ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/five-largest-nickel-mines-australia/#:~:text=1))) have long mine lives (into the 2040s).  Australia can likely maintain ~150–180 kt/yr by 2030, assuming existing mine expansions. (No announced giant new deposits; output growth limited.)  
• **EU (Finland)** – 0 after 2025. Finland’s Ni laterite (Talvivaara) mine is being wound down (closure by 2025 ([rawmaterials.news](https://rawmaterials.news/finland-government-prepares-for-talvivaara-nickel-mine-closure/#:~:text=The%20Finnish%20Government%20has%20determined,a%20press%20conference%20on%20Wednesday))), so EU domestic supply is effectively zero by 2030.  
• **Norway** – 0.  No Ni mining since 2001 ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/geologiske-ressurser/nickel-norway#:~:text=In%201989%20the%20Finnish%20company,operation%20which%20lasted%20until%202001)) and no projects on the horizon.  
• **Iceland** – 0.  No development of Ni ores.  
• **Japan** – 0.  No domestic Ni resources.  
• **Total (US+Allies)** – on the order of ~300–400 kt/yr by 2030 (mostly Canada+Australia).  In summary, US/allied domestic mine output will remain well below demand (e.g. ~350 kt vs ~1,300 kt demand).  This gap implies heavy import reliance for high-grade Ni or Ni compounds.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Detailed mapping targets komatiite–peridotite belts and mafic-ultramafic intrusions known to host Ni.  Stream-sediment and soil geochemical surveys seek Ni±Cu±Co anomalies downstream of bedrock sources.  Many Ni sulfide deposits (e.g. Voisey’s, Sudbury) were first inferred from elevated Ni/Cu in glacial till or stream sediments.  Geochemical fingerprinting (Ni, Cr, Co, PGE) helps vector to concealed ores.  
• **Airborne Electromagnetics (AEM):** Time-domain EM systems (e.g. VTEM, ZTEM) are key for Ni sulfides. These detect conductive sulfide lenses beneath cover.  Wolfgram and Golden (2001) note early Ni discoveries (1950s Canada) used airborne EM ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237645735_Airborne_EM_Applied_to_Sulphide_Nickel_-_Examples_and_Analysis#:~:text=Exploration%20for%20nickel%20sulphides%20has,often%20involved%20the)). Modern AEM surveys (helicopter-borne systems) routinely acquire conductivity-depth images to depths of several hundred meters, flagging targets like massive sulphides hidden under overburden ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237645735_Airborne_EM_Applied_to_Sulphide_Nickel_-_Examples_and_Analysis#:~:text=Exploration%20for%20nickel%20sulphides%20has,often%20involved%20the)).  
• **Aeromagnetic Surveys:** High-resolution total-magnetic-intensity data delineate crustal structure.  Magnetic anomalies outline ultramafic bodies or layered intrusions (e.g. komatiite flows) that could contain Ni.  Many Ni deposits are associated with magnetic signatures (due to magnetite in ultramafics).  Integrated AEM + magnetics mapping is standard in Ni terrains.  
• **Gravity and Seismic:** For deep deposits (e.g. massive Ni–Cu under cover), gravity surveys can detect dense sulfide-cumulate zones.  Seismic reflection has been applied (e.g. Sudbury Basin exploration) to image complex buried intrusions, though it is less common due to cost.  
• **Ground Geophysics:** Follow-up surveys (ground TEM/DCIP/IP) test anomalies from airborne data.  Down-hole EM/geophysics is used to confirm conductors in drill holes.  
• **Geospatial & Remote Sensing:** Satellite and hyperspectral imagery can identify laterite weathering facies or alteration (e.g. iron-rich regolith). Vegetation/soil-ferrous iron indices (e.g. ASTER band ratios) may highlight laterite exposures.  In some climates, Ni-hyperaccumulating plants (e.g. certain grasses or ferns) can indicate Ni-rich soils.  
• **Analytical Tools:** Portable XRF allows rapid in-field Ni assays on rocks and soils. Laser-induced fluorescence or LIBS can screen for sulphide mineralogy. Core logging with infrared spectrometry helps pick up alteration halos.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Nickel Sulfide Ore Processing:** Typical flowsheet uses crushing/grinding followed by flotation to produce Ni–Cu sulphide concentrate (~10–20% Ni). Concentrates are then smelted to produce Ni matte. For example, Ontario’s Sudbury operations smelt sulfide concentrate in an electric furnace/flash smelter to 75+% Ni matte, then convert and refine.  
• **Ferronickel (FeNi/NPI) Smelting:** Low-grade lateritic ores undergo pyrometallurgy.  A rotary kiln/electric furnace (RKEF) processes limonite ores (e.g. Philippines, Indonesia) to produce ferronickel (FeNi, 5–15% Ni) or nickel pig iron (NPI) as pig iron intermediates.  These class-2 products feed stainless mills or can be further refined (e.g. via converter).  
• **High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL):** Sulphuric acid autoclaves dissolve laterite Ni.  HPAL (250–270 °C, 3,500–4,000 psi) treats low-magnesium limonites, yielding Ni/Co sulfate solution.  Projects like Indonesia’s PT Vale HPAL plants (60 kt Ni/yr each) use this method ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/indonesia-says-nickel-miner-vale-build-another-2-bln-hpal-plant-2024-03-18/#:~:text=Indonesian%20nickel%20miner%20PT%20Vale,construction%20in%20Sulawesi%2C%20in%20collaboration)).  HPAL is capital-intensive but produces high recovery of Ni/Co.  
• **Heap Leaching:** Limonite ores can also be leached by stacking on heaps and irrigating with acid, a lower-cost alternative (e.g. Surigao, Indonesia). The acidic leachate is collected for Ni recovery.  
• **Smelting & Refining:** Sulfide concentrates are processed in furnaces to Ni metal. Ferronickel and NPI are also smelted (e.g. afforded by Tsingshan’s furnaces, though of lower purity).  
• **Carbonyl Process:** Historically, Ni carbonyl processing (Mond Process) was used to purify Ni (Raymond plant, etc.), but it is largely obsolete for modern volume production except in specialty refineries.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Critical for separating Ni from Co/Mg/Fe in hydrometallurgical streams.  Organophosphorus extractants (e.g. Cyanex 272, P204) selectively load Ni (or Co).  For example, SX is used to purify Ni from HPAL/NPI leach liquors and to split Ni/Co mixtures.   In the Ambatovy (Madagascar) and Sorowako (Indonesia) projects, SX circuits isolate Ni(II) as a pure solution.  
• **Ion Exchange (IX) & Precipitation:**  IX resins (e.g. Purolite) or pH control are used downstream of SX.  Ni can be precipitated as hydroxide or carbonate at precise pH (leaving impurities behind), then redissolved.  Advanced chemistry (e.g. glycerol ammonium sulfate crystallization) can further purify Ni sulfate.  
• **Magnetic & Density Separation:** For ore concentration, magnetite removal and heavy-liquid separation upgrades ultramafic ores before smelting, but this is more benefi­ciation than liqui­d separati­on.  
• **Selective Precipitation:** In mixed-metal solutions, Ni can be precipitated after Co by adjusting pH or using selective reagents (e.g. dimethylglyoxime for Ni separation). This is often part of the purification train to prepare feed for electrowinning.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Electrorefining (EW):** The primary method to produce high-purity Ni metal.  Impure Ni anodes (from smelting or precipitation) are dissolved in sulfuric acid and plated onto cathodes at ~99.9% Ni purity.  Major refineries (Sherritt, Vale, etc.) use EW to make battery-grade Ni.  
• **Carbonyl Refining (Mond Process):** Once common (e.g. in the Shawinigan refineries), Ni carbonyl gas decomposition can yield ultra-pure Ni.  It is now rare commercially but serves niche needs.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Precipitates:**  Nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)_2) is often produced after SX/EW. It can be filtered and thermally treated to nickel oxide or metal powder.  Pressed and sintered nickel powders (C–H₂ reduction) are used for specialty applications.  
• **Hydrogen Reduction:** Oxide or hydroxide products can be reduced in hydrogen furnaces to high-purity Ni metal.  
• **Refining Impurities:** Techniques like chlorination and slagging remove iron, sulfur, Cu, etc., to upgrade FeNi to superalloy-grade Ni. Continuous monitoring (XRF, mass spec) ensures tight spec.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Acid Mine Drainage Treatment:** Many Ni sulfide operations manage acid drainage by adding lime or limestone to neutralize runoff (raising pH to precipitate metal hydroxides).  Constructed wetlands and filtration beds can passively clean Ni-bearing water. For example, tailings impoundments are often lined and capped with alkaline clay to prevent sulfide oxidation.  
• **Metal Sequestration and Recovery:** Spent leach solutions can pass through ion-exchange or adsorption units (e.g. Dowex 50WX for Ni) to strip residual Ni before discharge.  Precipitants (e.g. NaOH, Na_2S) are used to recover Ni from wastewater as Ni(OH)_2 or NiS for safe disposal or reprocessing.  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Tailings from historic Ni mines (containing sulfides and laterites) can be reprocessed to stabilize and recover remaining Ni.  Technologies include re-grinding, flotation of tailings, or bioleaching with bacteria (Acidithiobacillus) to extract trapped Ni. [91] describes research into co-precipitation and stabilization of Ni in tailings.  
• **Phytoremediation:** In laterite mining regions, hyperaccumulator plants (e.g. certain Streptomtera or Acer species) are explored to uptake Ni from soils, concentrating it in biomass.  While still experimental, this can reduce soil Ni levels.  
• **Soil Amendments:** Contaminated soils are treated with amendments (e.g. engineered biochar, clay minerals) that bind Ni and reduce leachability.  
• **Mine Closure Practices:** Progressive reclamation (backfilling pits, re-contouring waste rock), erosion control, and revegetation with local species are standard to minimize long-term mobility of Ni and associated metals.
