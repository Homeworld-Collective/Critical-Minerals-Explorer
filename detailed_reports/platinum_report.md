# Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: High-capital autoclave/chlorination refineries; energy-intensive smelting infrastructure*

• **High-energy smelting/POX:** Conventional PGM refining relies on electric smelting (Furnace 2.7 m × 3.3 m per Peirce–Smith converter) and oxygen converting, which consume tens of megawatts of power. 2 t/h matte smelting furnaces typically require on the order of 30–40 MW of installed power ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  By contrast, hydrometallurgical routes like the Kell process (pressure‐oxidation followed by chlorination) can cut power needs dramatically – Liddell et al. report a ~84% reduction in electrical energy consumption and a 92% reduction in installed power versus smelting ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  However, these hydrometallurgical methods require specialized high-pressure autoclaves and chlorine-handling steps that are rare in US/EU facilities, as most PGM refining (e.g. at Impala or Amplats) is done in South Africa or Russia ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  (The Kell process is patented and has been piloted, but no major Kell-based refinery exists outside South Africa ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).)  Pressure-oxidation (POX) units (180–220°C, 20–30 bar O₂) oxidize sulphides to liberate base metals, another heavy-duty system mostly seen only in large Ni/Cu operations (e.g. Sherritt’s hydromet plants) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  In summary, existing Allied infrastructure lacks the large-scale smelters, converters, autoclaves, and chlorine plants needed for major Pt refining.

• **Scale and costs:** A commercial PGM refinery must be very large to be economical.  Capital expenditures for a mid-size plant (processing tens of thousands of tonnes per year of concentrate) are on the order of hundreds of millions to $\sim$US\$1 billion (steelwork, autoclaves, furnaces, tailings).  Comprehensive metallurgical testwork and pilot circuits are required before building such a plant.  By way of example, past industry guidance suggests that a small PGM smelter (a few hundred tonnes per day) can cost several hundred million dollars to build.  No new fully integrated Pt refinery has been built in the US or Europe in the last decade – most refinery expansions have been in South Africa (e.g. Impala 5E upgrade) or Russia ([www.bizcommunity.com](https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/sibanye-stillwater-to-acquire-us-pgm-refinery-for-82m-812363a#:~:text=Sibanye,acquire%20Metallix%20Refining%20for%20%2482m)) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  In practice, US/EU producers ship their scrap and concentrate overseas (often to Belgium, China, or South Africa) for final processing.  The only recent greenfield activity is in recycling: e.g. in 2025 Sibanye acquired the Metallix catalytic-converter recycling facility (North Carolina) for US\$82 million ([www.bizcommunity.com](https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/sibanye-stillwater-to-acquire-us-pgm-refinery-for-82m-812363a#:~:text=Sibanye,acquire%20Metallix%20Refining%20for%20%2482m)) ([www.bizcommunity.com](https://www.bizcommunity.com/article/sibanye-stillwater-to-acquire-us-pgm-refinery-for-82m-812363a#:~:text=For%20the%2012%20months%20ended,iridium%20and%20263klb%20of%20copper)) – a spent-catalyst smelter rather than a primary-Pt refinery.  Building a new autoclave+chlorination refinery for complex sulphide ore or tailings in an Allied country remains prohibitive without government incentives or giant projects.

# Key Bottleneck summary
The core bottleneck is the **complexity and scale of refining extremely low-grade PGM ore**.  Even rich reef ores contain only a few grams of PGM per tonne, requiring large mills and smelters.  Conventional matte smelting and converting step is extremely energy-intensive (tens of MW per unit) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)), whereas hydrometallurgical alternatives like Kell can drop energy use to a few MW ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  However, the needed equipment (high-pressure autoclaves, sulphuric acid chimneys, chlorine plants) is lacking outside major PGM producers.  Allied nations today import virtually all PGM concentrates and refined metal.  Without new domestic refineries or the discovery of very high-grade deposits, US/allies’ Pt production capacity will remain constrained.  Consequently, domestic (US+allies) Pt mine output – only a few percent of global output ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)) – cannot keep up with projected demand increases.  

# US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~15 tons/year combined from US, Canada, EU, Japan*

• **United States:**  The only PGM mines are Stillwater and East Boulder in Montana (Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd.), which produce Pt and Pd mainly as byproduct of Ni/Cu mining.  In 2022, USGS data indicate U.S. platinum production was only on the order of 2–3 t (2,800–3,700 kg) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)); palladium was higher (~9.8 t).  (Globally, the U.S. accounted for ∼3% of primary Pt supply ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).)  Sibanye reported ~426,000 oz of combined Pt+Pd (≈13.3 t total Pt+Pd) recovered in 2024 ([www.metalnomist.com](https://www.metalnomist.com/2025/04/sibanye-stillwater-sees-mixed-pgm.html#:~:text=Sibanye,costs%20amid%20challenging%20metal%20prices)), implying only a few tonnes of pure Pt.  Output has been volatile: weak metal prices and expiring U.S. incentives have led Sibanye to cut US PGM mining; it announced a plan to shutter Stillwater West and cut about 200,000 oz (∼6.2 t) of Pt+Pd annual output from 2025 onwards ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/sibanye-stillwater-posts-394-million-loss-on-weak-prices-us-impairment/#:~:text=The%20restructuring%20is%20likely%20to,460%2C000%20ounces%20this%20year)).  Current US mining yields are roughly 3‒4 t Pt-equivalent per year.  The Columbus, Ohio, metallurgical complex recovers Pt/Pd/Rh from recycled catalyst (~316,000 oz 3E in 2024 ([www.metalnomist.com](https://www.metalnomist.com/2025/04/sibanye-stillwater-sees-mixed-pgm.html#:~:text=The%20average%202E%20PGM%20basket,increase%20in%20the%20second%20half))), adding maybe another 1–2 t of Pt+Pd per year.

• **Canada:**  Platinum is not mined on its own; it is produced as a byproduct from Ni–Cu–PGE sulfide mines in Ontario and Quebec.  Canada’s total PGM output (2023) was ~702,000 oz (21.8 t) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Canadian%20mines%20produced,Manitoba%2C%20and%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador)), of which roughly 24% is Pt (≈5.2 t) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  The Lac des Iles mine (OWG) and several Sudbury-area Ni/Cu mines (Vale, Glencore etc.) account for virtually all domestic Pt.  Industry analysts estimate annual Canadian Pt around 4–6 t in recent years – Canada typically provides ~5–7 t/year of primary Pt ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  (This is a small fraction of Canada’s total production: most PGMs are Pd-rich.)  Output fluctuates with Ni/Cu markets; no major new PGM-focused mines are under development in Canada.  

• **Australia:**  Australia has no primary Pt mine.  In 2022 its dedicated PGM (Pt/Pd/Rh) production was only ~0.5 t of PGMs in total ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=,Production%20minor)) (virtually all as small byproduct credits at nickel laterite and sulfide operations).  Platinum specifically is negligible – only hundreds of kilograms per year – and typically arises from Russian/Ni laterite ores or surgical/aerospace scrap.  Earth AI’s AI-driven exploration (e.g. the Fontenoy Ni–Pd–Pt project in NSW) has highlighted new targets ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/massive-conductive-anomaly-identified-at-earth-ais-largest-deposit-302510145.html#:~:text=NEW%20SOUTH%20WALES%2C%20Australia%20and,Project%2C%20in%20New%20South%20Wales)), but any mining start-up is years away.  For now Australia’s Pt primary output is effectively zero.

• **European Union (+ Norway/Iceland):**  EU domestic production of Pt is extremely limited.  In 2022 Finland (Boliden Kevitsa Ni–Cu mine) produced ~1,243 kg of platinum ([www.theglobaleconomy.com](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/platinum_production/European-union/#:~:text=Platinum%20production%20in%20kilograms%2C%202022%3A)); Poland’s copper operations yield only tens of kilograms of Pt as byproduct; all other EU countries (and Norway/Iceland) produce essentially zero platinum.  (USGS/BGS data: EU Pt mining = ~1–2 t/year total).  The majority of “European” Pt is actually imported concentrates processed in Belgium, Germany, etc.  In summary, EU allied supply ~1–2 t/yr.

• **Japan:**  Japan has no Pt mines and relies entirely on imports of primary metal.  Domestic “production” (~2.0 t/yr) comes from recycling spent automotive catalysts and electronic scrap.  In 2022–2023 Japan recycled roughly 60–70 troy thousand ounces of PGMs (mostly Pt/Pd) from scrapped catalysts, which corresponds to ~2 t of Pt ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/en/media/2024/johnson-matthey-publishes-latest-pgm-market-report-2024#:~:text=,supply%20shortfall%20in%20ten%20years)).  Japan’s Pt demand thus is met by imported primary Pt and recycled secondary Pt.  

# US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 160–180 tons/year projected by 2030*

• **Automotive Catalysts:**  This remains the largest use (~30–45% of Pt) ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/automotive-market-continues-to-drive-platinum-demand-wpic-2023-05-12#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future%2C%20comprising%20between,of%20total%20platinum%20demand)).  New emissions rules (Euro VII, China 6b, US Tier 3) are expected to mandate higher Pt loadings in gasoline car catalytic converters.  Johnson Matthey projects global automotive platinum demand ~240 t in 2024 (including gasoline and Diesel cars) [JMPR 2024].  If the US+EU+Japan together consume ~50–55% of global automotive Pt (based on roughly half the world’s vehicle production) ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/automotive-market-continues-to-drive-platinum-demand-wpic-2023-05-12#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future%2C%20comprising%20between,of%20total%20platinum%20demand)), their combined auto sector demand could reach ~120–130 t/yr by 2030.  Even with gradual Diesel-car decline, growth in hybrids (which still use three-way Pt catalysts) and overall vehicle production means North America, Europe and Japan will require on the order of 0.12–0.13 kt of Pt per year in auto catalysts by 2030 ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/automotive-market-continues-to-drive-platinum-demand-wpic-2023-05-12#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future%2C%20comprising%20between,of%20total%20platinum%20demand)).  

• **Fuel Cells & Hydrogen:**  Pt is the key catalyst in PEM fuel cells.  Typical bus/train fuel cell stacks use ~10–30 g Pt each, smaller amounts in cars (down to ~5–6 g in prototypes) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/hydrogen-tech-expo-evidence-of-growing-momentum-with-platinum-set-for-key-role-as-a-transition-metal#:~:text=Green%20H2%20electrolysis%20is%20expected,automotive%20transport%20from%20the%20Expo)).  Japan’s 2030 hydrogen strategy targets up to 800,000 FCEVs and millions of residential fuel cells, while the US goal is ~1 million FCEVs plus substantial stationary electrolyzer capacity.  If realized, these could add an incremental allied Pt demand estimate on the order of **15–25 t/yr** by 2030 (primarily for mobile fuel cells and electrolyzers).  (WPIC forecasts hydrogen applications may claim up to ~20% of total Pt demand by 2030 ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/hydrogen-tech-expo-evidence-of-growing-momentum-with-platinum-set-for-key-role-as-a-transition-metal#:~:text=Green%20H2%20electrolysis%20is%20expected,automotive%20transport%20from%20the%20Expo)), but much depends on policy and technology adoption – this sector remains an emerging source.)  

• **Industrial Catalysts & Chemicals:**  Pt catalysts are used in acids and organic syntheses.  Historically ~30% of Pt went to industrial uses (refining naphtha (reformers), nitric acid production, silicone curing, etc.) ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/automotive-market-continues-to-drive-platinum-demand-wpic-2023-05-12#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future%2C%20comprising%20between,of%20total%20platinum%20demand)).  Growth in chemical production and heavy industry (plus new uses in green hydrogen electrolyzers) suggests allied industrial Pt demand could be **35–45 t/yr by 2030**.  (For example, increased deployment of large-scale PEM electrolyzers for green H₂ in the US/EU could consume several tonnes of Pt per year.)  Europe’s transition to green hydrogen, plus continuing use in silicone and glass chemistry, underpins this steady demand segment ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/automotive-market-continues-to-drive-platinum-demand-wpic-2023-05-12#:~:text=the%20foreseeable%20future%2C%20comprising%20between,of%20total%20platinum%20demand)).  

• **Jewelry & Investment:**  Western jewelry markets use comparatively little Pt (under 5% of global Pt, versus ~25% in China/India).  Allied jewelry demand is beige; platinum rings and watches are a niche.  Investment (ETFs, coins) is also modest in the US/EU/Japan.  Combined, jewelry+investment in allied markets is likely on the order of **10–15 t/yr** by 2030.  (High volatility; e.g., USGS notes US retail platinum jewelry is very small compared to global consumption.)  

Summing these segments gives total US+Allies Pt demand around 160–180 t/yr by 2030 – a large gap compared to domestic supply.

# US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: <20 tons/year projected mine and recycling supply*

• **United States:**  Without new mines, US underground output will remain ~3–4 t/yr of Pt (plus ~6–7 t/yr of Pd) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=,rhodium%20%2823%2C000%C2%A0oz)).  The cancelled Stillwater West expansion (fundamentally a flat-reef/platreef style deposit) has no near-term development plan.  Sibanye-Stillwater’s restructuring (closing Stillwater West, cutting high-cost ore) suggests US production could even decline.  Recycled scrapped catalysts at Columbus may increase modestly (from current ~10–12 t 3Eoz/year of PGM feed) but will mainly supply Pd.  Optimistically, even with recycling, US Pt supply is unlikely to exceed ~5–6 t/yr by 2030.

• **Canada:**  Current Pt byproduct output (~5–6 t/yr) is tied to Sudbury and Lac des Iles operations.  No new primary Pt mines are in advanced stages.  Sudbury base-metal projects may sustain or modestly increase PGM byproduct output; e.g. a ramp-up at Vale’s mines or an expansion at Lac des Iles might maintain Canadian Pt at the 5–6 t range.  By 2030 we estimate **7–8 t/yr** of Pt from Canada, assuming no major disruptions.  

• **Australia:**  Current Pt byproduct from Ni/Cu ores is only ~0.2–0.3 t/yr (2023: 0.5 t total PGE) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=,Production%20minor)).  The new Fontenoy discovery by Earth AI (Nov 2024) indicates a potential Ni–PGE deposit ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/massive-conductive-anomaly-identified-at-earth-ais-largest-deposit-302510145.html#:~:text=NEW%20SOUTH%20WALES%2C%20Australia%20and,Project%2C%20in%20New%20South%20Wales)), but even if it proceeds rapidly, first production would likely be mid-2030s.  Thus Australian Pt output will remain negligible through 2030 – on the order of **<1 t/yr** (mainly 0.1–0.3 t from Nickel Mines or IGO laterite projects).  

• **EU/Norway:**  Finland’s Kevitsa may continue ~3–5 t/yr (2E 4E PGMs; Pt portion ~1 t) through 2030 after potential small expansions.  A couple of new nickel/Cu projects in Finland (e.g. Suhanko, Pahtavaara) could add a bit more.  Even so, the EU (incl. Norway) will likely produce **<2 t/yr** Pt in total by 2030.  Allied Europe remains almost entirely import-reliant for Pt concentrate.

• **Japan:**  Domestic Pt “supply” from recycling (~2 t/yr) may rise to ~2–3 t by 2030 if collector changes and scrap returns strengthen (e.g. more efficient catalyst collection programs).  Japan will still have **zero primary output**, and nearly all its Pt needs (industrial-grade ingots, catalysts) must be imported.  

Overall, US-Allies can at best muster perhaps 15–18 t/yr of Pt (mine+recycle) by 2030.  This is far below projected demand (~160–180 t), underscoring the urgent need for substitutes, accelerated recycling, or alternate supply strategies.

# Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Airborne EM/magnetic surveys; AI-driven targeting; geochemical sampling; hyperspectral imaging*

• **Airborne Geophysics (EM/Gravity/Magnetics):**  Modern exploration uses helicopter- or plane-mounted sensors to detect buried sulfide bodies.  Systems like VTEM® or ZTEM® offer “superior depth penetration” and resolution ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/press-release?id=6840356267d6492749d8a923#:~:text=,EM%20systems%20may%20fall%20short)), often to several hundred meters, allowing mapping of Ni–Cu–PGM intrusions.  For example, VTEM Plus™ surveys have successfully identified buried magmatic Ni–Cu–PGE deposits by detecting their conductivity contrasts ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/press-release?id=6840356267d6492749d8a923#:~:text=,EM%20systems%20may%20fall%20short)).  Large magnetic surveys identify mafic-ultramafic intrusions (e.g. Bushveld-like layered bodies).  In Montana, Stillwater Critical Minerals employs airborne EM to scan for new reef-type targets along the Stillwater intrusion. 

• **Geochemical Surveys:**  Systematic sampling of soils, glacial tills, and stream sediments can reveal subtle Pt–Pd–Ni–Cu anomalies.  Advanced lab methods (e.g. lows-level ICP-MS) can measure PGM+base-metal content to parts per billion.  Techniques like multi-acid or ionic-leach analyses "decover" deeply buried mineralization by mobilizing trace PGMs into the near-surface regolith.  Enzyme–leach or modified total digestion methods are used to detect pathfinder chrome-platinum patterns above Merensky/UG2 zones.  Companies often grid-sample ultramafic series and stream catchments, looking for Pt/Pd ratios that signal primary PGM sources.

• **Remote Sensing & AI:**  Satellite and airborne hyperspectral imagers (e.g. ASTER, Sentinel) pick up alteration minerals (e.g. serpentine, chlorite) characteristic of ultramafic intrusions.  These data can outline prospective rock types in rugged or vegetated terrain.  Machine learning is increasingly used: AI algorithms integrate geological maps, drill logs, geochemistry, and geophysics to rank targets.  A notable example is Earth AI’s approach: it used proprietary AI-analysis of regional lithology and gravity data to prioritize the Fontenoy project in NSW, leading to their Ni–PGE discovery ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/massive-conductive-anomaly-identified-at-earth-ais-largest-deposit-302510145.html#:~:text=NEW%20SOUTH%20WALES%2C%20Australia%20and,Project%2C%20in%20New%20South%20Wales)).  Similarly, hyperspectral mapping has successfully delineated outcrops of PGM-bearing intrusives (e.g. mapping serpentinized peridotite belts).

• **Geological Mapping & Structural Study:**  Classical fieldwork remains key.  Detailed mapping of layered mafic-ultramafic complexes (e.g. identifying Merensky, UG2 or Platreef analogues) is essential.  New tools include drone photogrammetry for outcrop 3D models, and handheld portable XRF analyzers for on-the-spot geochemistry.  Structural studies (e.g. locating paleostream channels or roof-pendants) guide locating feeder zones or preserved channels of PGM-rich material.  In Archean cratons (e.g. Pilbara, Superior, Kaapvaal types), geologists seek channelized reef-horizons and footwall contacts that often host economic PGM concentrations.

# Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Mechanized underground mining; selective reef extraction; ore sorting; automation*

• **Underground Mining (Mechanized):**  PGMs occur in narrow reefs (0.5–3 m thick).  Mines use mechanized methods rather than room-and-pillar.  Common methods at Stillwater/Kivcet (Russia) include drift-and-fill and cut-and-fill (“captive” or cemented) stoping ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532009000100006&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFull%20text%20available%20only%20in,PDF%20format%E2%80%9D)).  Equipment like down-the-hole hammer drills, automated jumbo drills, LHDs and 60–90 ton shuttle cars are standard.  Modern depots employ collision-avoidance guidance and remote loading.  Temperature/humidity control is important in deep workings; water and ventilation systems are built accordingly. 

• **Selective Mining:**  Because PGM-bearing reefs are thin and variable, grade control is critical.  Face-sampling rigs or blind-drills (shallow blast holes) may be used continuously ahead of the face.  Some mines use on-line analysers (e.g. IR or XRF scanners on orepasses) to reject very low-grade material.  Stopes are backfilled (with cemented paste or waste rock) to suppress dilution and improve recovery.  For example, Stillwater Mine alternates cut-and-fill (lowering ore floors of backfilled stopes) and specialized drift-and-fill steps to systematically mine the Merensky/East Boulder reefs.

• **Open-Pit Mining:**  For disseminated or low-grade PGM in shallow zones (e.g. Labrador’s River Valley project or Poland’s copper-PGM deposits), conventional open-pit with drill/blast, wheel loaders, and 150–350 t trucks is used.  Blasting is optimized for PGM sulfides (often trying to avoid excessive fines).  Grade control may use dense drilling grids and fleet management software.  Hatch’s Truckplus or MineSight models are employed for scheduling.  

• **Ore Sorting:**  Increasingly, gravity or XRT/XRF sorters are tested on PGM ores.  For ultrabasic disseminated ore (with chromite or Ni-rich minerals), dense medium separation (DMS) can pre-concentrate sulphides at 2.8–3.2 SG, rejecting barren gangue.  Recent pilot projects (e.g. in the Bushveld) have shown sensor-based sorters can boost head grade by 20–40%.  For example, Eriez X-ray Transmission sorters have been trialed on UG2 ore with promising results.  Ore sorting is especially useful on tailings or low-grade stockpiles: SRC’s Kell plant concept actually borrows “dense medium” by operating as a leaching sorter (slurry density cutoff).

# Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Multi-stage flotation; flash flotation; column cells; IsaMill regrinding*

• **Froth Flotation:**  Virtually all sulfide PGM ore is concentrated by froth flotation.  Typical PGM concentrators achieve 85–95% PGM recovery ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225688418_JOMworld_nonferrous_smelter_survey_Part_II_Platinum_group_metals#:~:text=Primary%20producers%20of%20PGMs)).  Modern flowsheets are multi-stage: rougher flotation to capture coarse and liberated sulfides, followed by scavenger flotation for residuals, and then several cleaning stages.  Flash (or “Jameson”-type) flotation cells in the rougher circuit quickly recover the coarser liberated Pt-group minerals.  Final cleaning is often done in column flotation cells, allowing high-grade concentrates (>30% PGM, or >1000 g/t PGM) by washing away slime.  Reagent schemes use xanthates (e.g. potassium amyl xanthate for sulphides) plus collector/separators specific for Pt/Pd sulfarsenides. 

• **Fine Grinding/Regrinding:**  To liberate very fine PGMs bound in sulphide minerals or chromite, stirred mills like IsaMills or Detritors are used.  P80 grinding to 20–40 μm is common in regrind circuits ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532009000100006&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFull%20text%20available%20only%20in,PDF%20format%E2%80%9D)).  Such ultrafine grinding can boost overall recovery 5–10%.  IsaMills (energy-efficient attritors) often recycle a middling or scavenger concentrate fraction back to flotation after regrinding.  Typical power draw for IsaMills is ~15–20 kWh/tonne for P80~30 μm grinding (far less energy than a comparably sized ball mill).  

• **Gravity & Dense-Media:**  Some Kimberlite-type or Ni–Cu–PGM ores contain coarse minerals (e.g. pentlandite, sperrylite) that can be recovered by gravity pre-concentration.  Knelson centrifugal concentrators or Falcon RSDs capture heavy PGM grains (rhodian or sperrylite inclusions in chromite, etc.) as scavengers.  Gravity units can recover 1–3% extra PGM by removing coarse sulfide.  Dense Media Separation (using magnetite or ferrosilicon slurries) is applied to ROM ores to up-front reject >30% waste (especially effective for UG2 with chromite).  DMS typically produces a 30–50% enriched feed to downstream milling.  These pre-concentration steps reduce energy and reagent costs downstream.

# Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Pressure oxidation; chlorination leaching; solvent extraction; electrowinning*

• **Pressure Oxidation (POX):**  Autoclaves (180–220 °C, 20–30 bar O₂) cook Ni/Cu sulfide-flotation concentrate.  Base metals (Ni, Cu) go into solution (as sulfates) and sulphur is oxidized to gypsum or sulfuric acid, leaving a residue rich in PGMs, gold, cobalt.  This “acid CCW” route is standard for nickel laterites and used by Sherritt (Noranda mixes).  For example, Sherritt’s Ambatovy Ni plant in Madagascar uses POX (the EARSMELT or Sherritt-type process) to extract >95% of Ni/Cu and produce a PGM-bearing residue ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  The PGM residue is then further processed (leached or smelted).

• **Chlorination Leaching:**  The PGM-enriched residue or concentrate is roasted (to remove residual sulfides) then treated with chlorine gas or HCl/NaClO₃ at ~80–95 °C.  Under strongly oxidizing conditions (Eh >600 mV), Pt, Pd, Rh dissolve as chloride complexes (PtCl₆²⁻ etc.).  Well-designed chlorination (e.g. ConRoast+Kell style processes) can achieve >98% dissolution of Pt and Pd.  The pregnant chloride solution typically contains a few g/L of Pt/Pd.  For example, measures on mimosa tailings reached Pt dissolution >98% via chlorine in acid ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532011001400011&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=%E2%9E%A4%20Total%20energy%20consumption,70%25%20reduction)).  Chlorination is highly effective but requires corrosion-resistant reactors (Ti-lined autoclaves or glass-lined reactors) and careful gas handling.

• **Solvent Extraction:**  From chloride leach liquor, Pt and Pd are separated by selective SX.  Platinum (IV) chloride is commonly extracted using tertiary amines (e.g. Alamine 336) or quaternary phosphonium salts, leaving palladium behind or vice versa with LIX-type reagents.  Multi-stage mixer-settlers or centrifugal contactors achieve >99% individual recovery and separation.  After SX, Pt is stripped from the organic (by e.g. thiourea or NH₄Cl) to produce a purified PtCl₆²⁻ solution.  Similarly, Pd(II) is often recovered by ammonia leaching (forming Pd(NH₃)₄Cl₂) or another SX step.

• **Electrorefining & Reduction:**  Pure Pt metal is typically produced by electrowinning from chloride solutions at ~2–3 V.  Pt deposits as a spongy powder or film on electrodes.  Alternatively, chemical reducers (e.g. formic acid, SO₂, hydrazine) can precipitate Pt from solution as metal powder.  The crude sponge is then refined: e.g. chlorination of zinc-free Pd/Rh-free precipitate, followed by anion-exchange (Merrill-Crowe) to remove impurities.  Final refining (zone melting, powder metallurgy fusion or vacuum arc melting) yields >99.95% Pt bullion.  These steps are well-established in the South African and Clydach (UK) refineries; no Allied refiners currently do this on a large scale.

# Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Tailings retreatment; catalyst recycling; AMD neutralization; metal recovery*

• **Tailings Reprocessing:**  Historic PGM tailings (often ~1–2 g/t or lower) still contain recoverable metal.  Modern methods (combining fine grinding, flotation, and/or Kell leaching) can extract 30–50% of residual PGMs.  For example, companies like Anglo American (Twickenham tailings) and Wesizwe Precious Metals have proposed hydrometallurgical reprocessing of oxidized PGM tailings.  Kell-type autoclave leach can treat oxidized tailings to dissolve base metals and liberate Pt, with acid chlorination to recover the precious metals.  Economic studies suggest that tailings with >0.5 g/t Pt+Pd and volume >10 Mt can be profitable to rework, recovering tens of kilograms of PGMs per year as secondary supply.

• **Spent Catalyst Recycling:**  End-of-life autocatalysts contain ~3–7% PGMs by weight and are efficiently recycled.  Modern recycling (in Belgium, South Africa, Australia, or the US) uses either pyrometallurgical (electric furnace smelting with collectors) or hydrometallurgical flowsheets.  In pyrometallurgy, catalysts are smelted (e.g. in plasma or top-blown converters) with collectors (Cu, Fe-based) to produce a metal button containing >95% of the feed’s Pt/Pd/Rh ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/hydrogen-tech-expo-evidence-of-growing-momentum-with-platinum-set-for-key-role-as-a-transition-metal#:~:text=The%20ongoing%20development%20across%20the,total%20platinum%20demand%20by%202030)).  The PGMs are then refined similarly to raw ore, typically using aqua regia or similar to separate Pt/Pd.  Global recovery efficiencies exceed 95% for Pt/Rh from catalysts ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/hydrogen-tech-expo-evidence-of-growing-momentum-with-platinum-set-for-key-role-as-a-transition-metal#:~:text=The%20ongoing%20development%20across%20the,total%20platinum%20demand%20by%202030)).  Secondary supply (scrap+recycle) accounts for roughly 25–30% of global Pt supply.  Allied refiners (e.g. Umicore US, Heraeus USA) process domestic scrap under such methods, and capacity is growing as automakers expand collection programs.

• **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Treatment:**  PGMs themselves are not very soluble, but PGM tailings often generate acidic drainage.  Alkaline neutralization (lime, limestone) is standard: adding Ca(OH)₂ to raise pH to ~8–9 precipitates many heavy metals as hydroxides.  Sulfate reduction (reactor with organic substrates or sulfate-reducing bacteria) can remove sulphate and immobilize dissolved metals as sulphides.  Specific to PGMs, ion-exchange resins have been tested to recover trace dissolved Pt/Pd from process water.  Constructed wetlands (with limestone media and vegetation) are used in some old mining districts to passively raise pH and sequester metals.  In all cases, conventional water-treatment tech is adapted for PGM mine effluent by targeting Fe-Cr-Ni removal, thus generating a stable residue (hydroxide sludge) that still contains very low levels of PGMs (<0.1 g/t) but is usually landfilled.

• **In-Situ Recovery (Experimental):**  Research is exploring bioleaching of PGM ores.  Certain acidophilic bacteria (e.g. Thiobacillus spp., Ferroplasma) can oxidize sulphides, potentially liberating PGMs into solution.  Pilot heap-leach projects (e.g. at Nkomati Ni, Xstrata) showed modest Pt-precipitation in bioleach, but full-scale PGM bioleaching has not yet been commercialized.  Ionic liquid systems (e.g. chloride ILs) are also being developed to dissolve ultrafine or low-grade PGM residues at low temperature.  These are at R&D stage; none are industrial practice, but they illustrate emerging methods to avoid energy-intensive smelting and capture PGMs in a leach.
