# US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** Platinum is mined only in Montana (Stillwater and East Boulder mines, owned by Sibanye Stillwater Ltd.).  USGS data show US Pt output was only ~3,600 kg (3.6 t) in 2019 ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_platinum_production#:~:text=4%20,2017)) (≈2% of global production ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/platinum-in-the-us/#:~:text=According%20to%20GlobalData%2C%20the%20US,market%20in%20its%20Global%20Platinum))).  This supply (mostly from narrow, high-grade mafic intrusions) is small and volatile – Sibanye recently cut US PGM output by ~200,000 oz (≈6.2 t) to mitigate losses ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/sibanye-close-securing-up-700-million-prepayment-deals-after-first-half-loss-2024-09-12/#:~:text=and%20palladium%20output%20in%20response,The)).  No other US platinum mines are operating, so domestic production remains at only a few tons/year.  

• **Canada:** All Canadian Pt is byproduct from Ni–Cu–PGE sulfide mines.  In 2019 Canada produced ~7,400 kg (7.4 t) of Pt ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_platinum_production#:~:text=4%20,2017)).  Major operations include Vale-/Glencore’s Sudbury Complex (Ontario) and Impala Platinum’s Lac des Iles mine.  These companies (Glencore, Impala) account for virtually all Canadian Pt ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/platinum-in-canada/#:~:text=Leading%20producers%20of%20platinum%20in,Platinum%27s%20output%20decreased%20by%2011)).  Output fluctuates with base-metal mining, but Canada consistently supplies on the order of 7–8 t/yr.  

• **Australia:** Australia has no primary Pt mines; reported output was only ~170 kg (0.17 t) in 2017 ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_platinum_production#:~:text=8%20,2017)).  Most Pt in Australia comes as trace byproduct of nickel/copper projects or recycling.  New exploration (e.g. AI-driven surveys) is yielding prospects: Earth AI recently announced a large Ni–Pt–Pd discovery at its Fontenoy project (NSW) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/21/australia-metals-ai-palladium-platinum-clean-energy#:~:text=An%20AI,new%20metal%20and%20mineral%20deposits)), but production from that deposit is years away.  

• **European Union (+ Norway/Iceland):** Minimal domestic Pt mining.  Finland (Boliden, Agnico-Eagle) produced ~1,420 kg (1.42 t) in 2017 ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_platinum_production#:~:text=7%20,2017)) (from Ni–Cu ores); Poland ~97 kg.  Other EU countries and Norway/Iceland have no significant Pt mines.  (Any “European” Pt supply comes from South Africa/Russia through refiners in the EU.)  

• **Japan:** Virtually all “production” is from recycling industry – no mines.  In 2017 Japan refined ~1,747 kg (1.75 t) of Pt ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_platinum_production#:~:text=7%20,2017)) from catalysts and scrap.  All of Japan’s Pt is therefore imported as metal or in concentrates for domestic refinery.  

# US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Automotive Catalysts:** The largest demand segment.  Historically ~30–42% of global Pt goes into vehicle catalytic converters ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/about/demand-drivers#:~:text=Automotive%20demand%20for%20platinum%20is,in%20the%20last%20five%20years)).  Stricter emissions standards (Euro 7, US Tier 3) will increase Pt loadings.  Growth of hybrids (which still use three-way catalysts) has recently buoyed auto Pt demand ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/about/demand-drivers#:~:text=Autocatalyst%20demand%20for%20platinum%20is,to%20achieve%20lower%20emissions%20requirements)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/hybrid-cars-throw-lifeline-platinum-metals-2024-09-09/#:~:text=Hybrid%20cars%20are%20offering%20a,expected%20to%20sustain%20PGM%20demand)).  For example, Johnson Matthey projects global automotive Pt demand ≈7.61 million oz (~236 t) in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/platinum-set-biggest-deficit-decade-2024-says-johnson-matthey-2024-05-08/#:~:text=En%202024%2C%20el%20mercado%20del,mientras%20que%20la)); if US+EU+Japan consume ~60% of that, their auto sector could demand on the order of 100–120 t/yr by 2030 (despite EV penetration).  

• **Fuel Cells & Hydrogen:** Pt is key in hydrogen fuel cells (typically 30–60 g Pt per vehicle) and in electrolyzers.  Japan, South Korea and the US are promoting FCEVs and H₂ infrastructure.  Though still niche, reports suggest rising hydrogen bus/truck use and fuel-cell stationary power.  (FT notes coordinated push for FCEVs ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/41fe6407-ca14-4bf3-b5ee-0163c0b4888c#:~:text=Toyota%27s%20hydrogen%20division%20chief%2C%20Mitsumasa,by%20high%20infrastructure%20costs%2C%20insufficient)).)  If even modest fleets deploy by 2030, this could add ~10–20 t/yr in allied demand.  

• **Industrial Catalysts & Chemicals:**  About 27–36% of Pt goes to industrial uses (e.g. nitric acid, silicone production) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/about/demand-drivers#:~:text=%2A%20Automotive29%E2%80%9342,%2A%20%209)).  Additional demand arises from “green” hydrogen (Pt-catalyzed PEM electrolyzers) and fuel-cell generation for power.  Allied industry (refineries, chemical plants) will maintain roughly steady Pt usage (potentially 30–50 t/yr combined by 2030).  

• **Jewelry and Investment:**  Platinum jewelry accounts for ~23–29% of global demand ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/about/demand-drivers#:~:text=%2A%20Automotive29%E2%80%9342,%2A%20%209)), but this is mostly in India/China.  In US/EU, Pt jewelry demand is small (<5 t/yr), and investment (coins, ETFs) is variable.  By 2030, allied jewelry/investment demand will likely remain on the order of 10–20 t/yr.  

*Total allied demand ~150–170 t/yr by 2030 is plausible.*  (For context, WPIC reports ~7.59 Moz global Pt demand in 2024, ≈236 t ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/weaker-supply-will-drive-platinum-deficit-higher-than-expected-2024-wpic-says-2024-05-13/#:~:text=418%2C000%20onzas,a%207.587%20millones%20de)); even a 10% drop in demand still exceeds domestic output.)  

# US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** Without major new mines, US mine output will remain <5 t/yr.  Stillwater West (US Silica/Sibanye) will not start until late 2020s at best.  Sibanye’s cuts (200,000 oz, ~6.2 t less Pt/Pd) in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/sibanye-close-securing-up-700-million-prepayment-deals-after-first-half-loss-2024-09-12/#:~:text=and%20palladium%20output%20in%20response,The)) imply stagnant or declining US production.  Even if existing mines hold capacity, 2030 production is likely only ~3–4 t/yr Pt (plus similar Pd).  

• **Canada:** Ontario supply may grow slightly.  North American Palladium’s Lac des Iles expansion and continued Sudbury output could lift Pt yield to ~8–10 t by 2030.  (Mining-Technology notes Canada’s 2023 Pt output rose ~13% vs 2022 ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/platinum-in-canada/#:~:text=According%20to%20GlobalData%2C%20Canada%20is,Buy%20the%20report%20here)).)  No dedicated new Pt projects are imminent, so Canadian production is tied to Ni/Cu projects.  

• **Australia:** If the Fontenoy discovery is developed, Australia could add Pt supply (project size unannounced).  Otherwise Pt output remains negligible.  No announced primary-Pt mine exists; current byproduct streams (e.g. Murrin Murrin Ni smelter, copper mines) yield only fractions of a ton per year.  Optimistically, allied Australia Pt might contribute a few tonnes (2–3 t/yr) by 2030 at best ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/21/australia-metals-ai-palladium-platinum-clean-energy#:~:text=An%20AI,new%20metal%20and%20mineral%20deposits)).  

• **EU/Norway:** Still essentially zero.  Finland’s new mines (like Keliber) may touch PGMs lightly, but no major Pt project.  EU policy does not include Pt mining initiatives, so domestic EU supply by 2030 will remain <2 t/yr.  Norway/Iceland: no Pt mines – these countries will rely on imports.  

• **Japan:** No change – still ~1–2 t from scrap reprocessing.  All other needs must be satisfied by imports.  

*In sum, US/allied mine+recycle supply in 2030 likely ≪20 t/yr*, far below domestic demand. (World platinum mining is dominated by South Africa/Russia; WPIC projects a ~476,000 oz (15 t) supply deficit for 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/weaker-supply-will-drive-platinum-deficit-higher-than-expected-2024-wpic-says-2024-05-13/#:~:text=El%20Consejo%20Mundial%20de%20Inversiones,el%20d%C3%A9ficit%20de%202024%20en)).)

# Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Airborne Geophysics (EM/Gravity/Magnetics):** Multisensor surveys map mafic intrusions and conductive sulfides.  Airborne EM (e.g. Helicopter or fixed-wing) is used to detect deep Ni–Cu–Pd–Pt sulfide bodies (stillwater Complex analogs).  Anomaly picks are followed up with ground surveys and drilling.  (For example, Stillwater Critical Minerals is using airborne EM to target Montana Ni–Pt prospects.)  
• **Geochemical Surveys:** Systematic soil, glacial-till, and stream-sediment sampling for Ni, Cu, Pt, Pd anomalies. Raised contents indicate proximal sulfide sources, guiding drill targets.  Many PGM deposits (e.g. Bushveld-type intrusions) were first located via anomalous Cr, Ni, or PGE geochemical signatures.  
• **Remote Sensing & AI Analytics:** Satellite/airborne hyperspectral and lidar can identify alteration or ultramafic rock signatures.  AI-driven data analysis is emerging: e.g. Earth AI used machine learning on geophysical and geological data to pinpoint a Ni–Pt–Pd prospect (Fontenoy, Australia) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2024/11/21/australia-metals-ai-palladium-platinum-clean-energy#:~:text=An%20AI,new%20metal%20and%20mineral%20deposits)).   
• **Geological Mapping & Structural Interpretation:** Field mapping of layered mafic–ultramafic complexes (e.g. ophiolites, sills, dykes) and intrusive contacts can reveal PGM-bearing horizons (e.g. Merensky Reef analogs).  Geologists look for footwall-hosting chromitite or sulfide layers. Tectonic reconstructions (ancient rifts, collisional belts) also focus exploration.  

# Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Underground Mining (Mechanized):** Most Pt in allied countries is mined underground.  Narrow disseminated mineralization (e.g. Stillwater Complex) is extracted via conventional drill-and-blast with jumbo drills, plus long-hole or cut-and-fill stoping.  New mines use automation (remote-controlled rigs, LHDs, trucks).  (For example, Sibanye’s Stillwater mines in Montana employ mechanized drifting and long-hole stopes.)  
• **Block/Sublevel Caving:** Some large, tabular PGM orebodies (e.g. deep layered intrusions) may be extracted by bulk-caving methods.  This could apply if a sufficiently thick PGM-orebody were developed (as in some South African mines). Allied projects have not used block caving for Pt but could if scale justified (e.g. hypothetical future U.S. projects).  
• **Open-Pit Mining:** Where PGM mineralization is near-surface (often as Ni–Cu–PGM disseminations), large open-pit mining and heap/storage leaching may be used.  Allied examples: (1) In Sudbury (Canada) Pt comes from open-pit truck-and-shovel and underground Ni–Cu mines. (2) Aurora mine (MT, now closed) was an open pit Cu–Au–PGM. Modern tech (GNSS drills, automated shovels) is standard.  
• **In-situ Preconcentration:** Experimental techniques (e.g. ambient-temperature leaching to upgrade PGM-bearing layers in place) have been tested in lab but are not yet commercial. Bioleaching of Pt is under R&D (using bacteria to oxidize sulfidic ores) but unproven at scale.  

# Key Separation Technologies  
• **Froth Flotation:** Primary separation for sulfide ores.  Crushed and milled ore is floated (often after copper sulphide flotation) to produce a high-grade Ni–Cu–PGM concentrate.  Allied mineral processors follow multi-stage flotation.  For Pt-bearing ores, modern “mill–float–mill–float” circuits can regrind and refloat tails, boosting Pt/Pd recovery by up to 10% ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=benefits,initial%20process%20development%20work%2C%20significant)). (E.g., treating “dirty” concentrates twice can recover PGMs that would otherwise remain in tailings.)  
• **Magnetic/Gravity Separation:** Coarser chromite or magnetite may be removed magnetically before flotation, particularly in Bushveld-type ores.  Gravity separators (spirals, shaking tables) occasionally pre-concentrate heavy minerals if Pt minerals (e.g. sperrylite) are liberated. These methods are minor for Pt but help clean feed to flotation.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Pre-Treatment:** Recently, pressure oxidation (autoclave) has been adopted (especially in Canada) as a pre-flotation step for Ni–Cu concentrates.  This oxidizes base sulphides (Ni, Cu) to sulfates while leaving Pt/Pd largely in the residue.  The resulting base-metal liquor is processed separately (e.g., Sherritt electrolytic Ni recovery), simplifying downstream PGM recovery ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20Kell%20Process%20has%20been,The)).  
• **Solvent Extraction / Ion Exchange:** After initial metal recoveries, PGMs in chloride solution are separated by selective extractants or ion-exchange resins.  For example, anion-exchange resin can adsorb Pt/Pd chlorocomplexes; subsequent elution or resin incineration yields a PGM-rich product ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=recovered%20into%20solution%20from%20the,nickel%2C%2080%20per%20cent%20for)). These steps concentrate Pt/Pd and purify them away from copper/iron.  

# Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Pressure Oxidation + Chlorination (Kell Process):**  A leading allied refinement route is the Kell hydrometallurgical flow-sheet ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20Kell%20Process%20has%20been,The)).  In Kell, a pressure-oxidation (autoclave) leach first removes Ni, Cu, Co by sulfates ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20Kell%20Process%20has%20been,The)).  The remaining solids (rich in Pt, Pd, etc.) are roasted (calcined) then leached with chlorine gas.  This dissolves Pt/Pd into solution.  Finally, Pt/Pd are recovered (via resin adsorption and incineration) as a high-grade metal concentrate ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20Kell%20Process%20has%20been,The)) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=recovered%20into%20solution%20from%20the,nickel%2C%2080%20per%20cent%20for)).  Kell trials achieved >95% Pt/Pd recovery ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20Kell%20Process%20has%20been,The)) with far lower energy use than conventional smelting.  
• **Matte Smelting & Electrorefining:** The traditional route (less common in US/EU facilities) is to smelt the Ni–Cu–PGM concentrate into a matte.  Copper and iron are then removed (e.g. by converting to blister copper and Fe-sulfides).  The PGM-bearing matte is leached (as in the Bauer chlorination process) and precipitated or electrowon.  For instance, South African plants use chlorine gas on matte to extract Pt/Pd, which are then purified by precipitation/electrolysis.  While energy-intensive, this pyromet step is a proven route where available.  
• **Ion-Leach & Precipitation:** Some allied refiners use direct leaching of scrap or matte with aqua regia or chlorine, followed by selective precipitation.  Chloride complexes of Pt/Pd may be precipitated by sulfur dioxide or hydrochloric acid.  The solid product (“Soxhlet ash” etc.) is then refined by electrolysis or hydrogen reduction to yield pure Pt metal.  These unit operations (chlorination, precipitation, electrowinning) are industry standard ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=Leaching%20of%20PGMs%20requires%20the,for%20this%20reason%2C%20and%20to)).  

# Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:**  Many PGM operations consider re-treating their flotation tailings to capture remaining Pt/Pd.  Advanced processes (e.g. Kell) allow low-grade or “dirty” tailings to be reprocessed, recovering PGMs and Ni that were missed ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=benefits,initial%20process%20development%20work%2C%20significant)).  This reduces environmental footprint by extracting value from waste. (For example, Kell’s design specifically accommodates retreatment of tailings from “float–mill–float” circuits ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=benefits,initial%20process%20development%20work%2C%20significant)).)  
• **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Treatment:**  Pt mines generate acidic effluent from sulfide oxidation.  Allied operations would use established AMD controls: neutralization (lime or limestone reactors), aeration wetlands, and selective ion-exchange to remove heavy metals.  Montana’s Stillwater mines, for example, treat sulfide-rich water with lime to precipitate metals.  New technologies (e.g. biological sulfate reduction cells) are under study to passively clean PGM-mine water.  
• **Spent Catalyst Recycling:**  Although not strictly “mining,” recycling spent autocatalysts and industrial catalysts is a form of secondary remediation.  Companies like Johnson Matthey/Umicore/BASF use high-pressure leaching and chlorination to strip Pt/Pd from used converters.  For instance, Pt in spent catalysts is dissolved in aqua regia or chloride and then electroplated or precipitated back to metal.  Such recycling plants recover >90% of Pt from waste catalysts, reducing the need for virgin mining. (Anion-exchange resins can concentrate these recovered PGMs to ~80–85% purity ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=recovered%20into%20solution%20from%20the,nickel%2C%2080%20per%20cent%20for)).)  
• **Phytoremediation (Experimental):** Research is exploring planted systems that bioaccumulate PGMs from contaminated soils or low-grade ore.  Certain ferns or microorganisms can uptake Pt-group elements.  While not yet commercial, this “green mining” approach offers an emerging remediation method for diffuse PGM pollution.

# Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **High-energy smelting/pressure-oxidation:**  Platinum ores are extremely low-grade, so recovering Pt requires large plants.  Traditional smelters (matte furnaces) consume tens of megawatts of power (on the order of 38 MW for a 2 t/h unit ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=approximately%203%20MW%20compared%20with,for%20matte%20smelting%20and%20refining))).  Few such facilities exist in allied countries (virtually all PGMs are smelted in South Africa/Russia).  Alternative hydrometallurgy (e.g. Kell process) can cut energy to ~3 MW ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=approximately%203%20MW%20compared%20with,for%20matte%20smelting%20and%20refining)), but these autoclave/chlorination setups are capital-intensive and uncommon outside large PGM mines.  Without such infrastructure, allied Pt producers must ship concentrates overseas.  

• **Capital & Scale:**  Building a PGM refinery or smelter is extraordinarily costly.  Greenfields require detailed metallurgical bench tests (as Kell did) and scale-up pilot plants ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=benefits,initial%20process%20development%20work%2C%20significant)). The Kell process itself exemplifies the leap in technology needed: it can treat complex or tailings material with “much-reduced power costs” ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=smelting%20are%20summarized%20in%20this,grade%20%27dirty)), but scaling it up is non-trivial. In practice, this means no new medium-bulk scale Pt refineries have been built in the US/EU – effectively capping domestic output.  

# Key Bottleneck summary  
The core bottleneck is the **complexity and cost of processing extremely low-grade platinum ores**. Conventional PGM refining (smelting and electro-refining) is energy-intensive – e.g. an oxidized concentrate requires ~38 MW of power for a small-scale smelter vs. ~3 MW for an optimized hydrometallurgical plant ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=approximately%203%20MW%20compared%20with,for%20matte%20smelting%20and%20refining)).  Allied producers lack such specialized infrastructure, so developing local Pt sources is uneconomical. In short, without domestic autoclaves/refineries or new high-grade deposits, US/allied Pt output will remain a tiny fraction of demand ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=approximately%203%20MW%20compared%20with,for%20matte%20smelting%20and%20refining)) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000100009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20Kell%20Process%20has%20been,The)).
