# US and Allies Domestic Critical Mineral Supply Chain Report: Platinum

# Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: High-capital autoclave/chlorination refineries; energy-intensive smelting infrastructure*

• **High-energy smelting/pressure-oxidation:** Platinum ores are extremely low-grade (typically 2-10 g/t), requiring large-scale processing plants. Traditional matte smelters consume approximately 38 MW of power for a 2 t/h unit, while few such facilities exist in allied countries (virtually all PGM refining occurs in South Africa/Russia). Alternative hydrometallurgical processes like the Kell process can reduce energy consumption to ~3 MW but require capital-intensive autoclave and chlorination infrastructure uncommon outside major PGM operations.

• **Capital & Scale:** Building a PGM refinery requires extraordinary capital investment ($500M-$1B for medium scale). Greenfield projects require extensive metallurgical testing and pilot plant scale-up. The Kell process exemplifies the technological leap needed: while it can treat complex or tailings material with reduced power costs, scaling requires specialized expertise. No new commercial-scale Pt refineries have been built in the US/EU in the past decade, effectively capping domestic refining capacity.

# Key Bottleneck summary
The core bottleneck is the **complexity and cost of processing extremely low-grade platinum ores**. Conventional PGM refining (smelting and electro-refining) is energy-intensive, requiring ~38 MW for small-scale smelters versus ~3 MW for optimized hydrometallurgical plants. Allied producers lack specialized infrastructure for chlorination, autoclave leaching, and PGM separation. Without domestic refineries or new high-grade deposits, US/allied Pt output will remain below 5% of demand.

# US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~15 tons/year combined from US, Canada, EU, Japan, Australia*

• **United States:** Platinum is mined only in Montana at the Stillwater and East Boulder mines (owned by Sibanye-Stillwater Ltd.). USGS data show US Pt output was 3,650 kg (3.65 t) in 2022, representing approximately 2% of global production. This supply from narrow, high-grade reef-type deposits in the Stillwater Complex is volatile – Sibanye announced in 2024 it would reduce US PGM output by approximately 200,000 oz (≈5.7 t combined Pt+Pd) to mitigate losses. Current US platinum mine production is approximately 3-4 tons/year.

• **Canada:** All Canadian Pt is byproduct from Ni–Cu–PGE sulfide mines. In 2022, Canada produced approximately 7,000 kg (7.0 t) of Pt according to Natural Resources Canada. Major operations include Vale's and Glencore's Sudbury Complex (Ontario) and Impala Platinum's Lac des Iles mine. These operations account for virtually all Canadian Pt production. Output fluctuates with base-metal mining economics but Canada consistently supplies 7-8 t/yr.

• **Australia:** Australia has no primary Pt mines; production in 2022 was approximately 200 kg (0.2 t) according to Geoscience Australia. Most Pt comes as trace byproduct from nickel laterite operations or recycling. Earth AI announced a Ni–Pt–Pd discovery at its Fontenoy project (NSW) in November 2024, but production is years away pending feasibility studies.

• **European Union (+ Norway/Iceland):** Minimal domestic Pt mining exists. Finland produced approximately 1,000 kg (1.0 t) in 2022 from Ni–Cu ores at operations like Boliden's Kevitsa mine. Poland produces <100 kg annually from copper operations. Other EU countries, Norway, and Iceland have no significant Pt mines. Most European Pt supply comes from imported concentrates refined in Belgium and Germany.

• **Japan:** Japan produces approximately 2,000 kg (2.0 t) annually entirely from recycling of automotive catalysts and industrial scrap. Japan has no platinum mines and relies completely on imports for primary metal supply.

# US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 160-180 tons/year projected by 2030*

• **Automotive Catalysts:** The largest demand segment, accounting for 35-40% of global Pt consumption. Stricter emissions standards (Euro 7, China 6b, US Tier 3) require higher Pt loadings in gasoline catalysts. Johnson Matthey projects global automotive Pt demand at approximately 240 tons in 2024. Growth in hybrid vehicles, which use conventional catalytic converters, supports continued demand. If US+EU+Japan represent 50-55% of global automotive demand (based on vehicle production data), their automotive sector could require 120-130 t/yr by 2030.

• **Fuel Cells & Hydrogen:** Platinum catalyst loadings in PEM fuel cells currently range from 10-30 g per vehicle (reduced from earlier 30-60 g designs). Japan's hydrogen strategy targets 800,000 FCEVs by 2030, while the US aims for 1 million. Combined with stationary fuel cells and electrolyzer demand for green hydrogen production, this sector could add 15-25 t/yr in allied demand by 2030.

• **Industrial Catalysts & Chemicals:** Approximately 30% of Pt goes to industrial uses including petroleum refining, silicone production, and nitric acid catalysts. PEM electrolyzer deployment for green hydrogen will add to industrial demand. Allied industrial usage is projected at 35-45 t/yr by 2030 based on chemical production forecasts.

• **Jewelry and Investment:** Platinum jewelry represents <5% of demand in Western markets (versus 25% globally, concentrated in China/India). Investment demand through ETFs and coins is volatile but typically 5-10 t/yr in allied countries. Combined jewelry and investment demand likely 10-15 t/yr by 2030.

# US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: <20 tons/year projected mine and recycling supply*

• **United States:** Without major new mines coming online, US mine output will remain 3-4 t/yr. The Stillwater West expansion project remains in early exploration phase with no defined timeline. Sibanye's 2024 production cuts indicate stagnant or declining near-term US production. Recycling may add 1-2 t/yr.

• **Canada:** Continued production from Sudbury and potential modest expansion at Lac des Iles could maintain Canadian output at 7-9 t/yr by 2030. No new primary Pt projects are in advanced development. Canadian production remains tied to nickel and copper project economics.

• **Australia:** Even if the Fontenoy discovery advances rapidly, Australian Pt production will likely remain below 1 t/yr through 2030. Current byproduct streams from nickel and copper operations yield only 200-300 kg annually.

• **EU/Norway:** Finnish production may increase slightly with potential new nickel projects, but EU domestic supply will remain below 2 t/yr. No primary platinum projects are in development. Norway and Iceland will continue to have zero production.

• **Japan:** Recycling capacity may increase to 2-3 t/yr by 2030 with improved collection systems, but Japan will remain entirely dependent on imports for primary supply.
