## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
- **United States:** Only one small chromite mine is active (Montana), yielding on the order of 20–30 kt crude chromite per year ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=While%20the%20U,domestic%20recycling%20of%20stainless%20steel)).  This translates to roughly 5–7 kt of contained Cr.  By comparison, U.S. mine output has been nearly zero in past official accounts; virtually all domestic chromium comes from imported chromite ore, finished ferrochrome or recycled scrap ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=While%20the%20U,domestic%20recycling%20of%20stainless%20steel)).  
- **Canada:** Currently no commercial chromite production.  Exploration in the Ring of Fire (Ontario) and pilot testing (Canada Chrome Company, etc.) are underway, but production has not yet begun. Domestic output is effectively 0 t as of 2024.  
- **Australia:** No operating chromite mines at present (Australia’s Identified Mineral Resources 2024 shows “0” operating mines and “0” production for chromium) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/aimr/preliminary-tables#:~:text=Chromium%20%20,0)).  Several projects (e.g. Roebuck Bay) are at development stage, but today Australian chromium output is negligible.  
- **European Union (EU):** Finland is the only EU country with active chromite mining.  Outokumpu’s Kemi underground mine produced ~1.3 million tonnes of chromite ore per year (circa 2009) ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=processing,optimization%20opportunities%2C%20one%20might%20think)); more recent data report Finland’s chromite output at about 2.3 Mt/yr of ore (roughly 0.6 Mt Cr content) ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/industrial-minerals/chrome-and-chromite/#:~:text=form%20part%20of%20the%20Bushveld,1%20million)). This makes Outokumpu the EU’s sole domestic source of chromium.   
- **Norway & Iceland:** No known chromite mining or production.  
- **Japan:** No domestic chromite mines; Japan meets its chromium needs entirely via imports (from S. Africa, India, etc.) and from recycled stainless steel.     

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
- **Drivers:** 85–90% of chromium demand is for stainless steel (SS) and specialty alloys ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=Roughly%2085%20percent%20of%20the,corrosive%20and%20hardness%20qualities)).  Allied consumption scales with SS output.  In 2018 the US consumed ~550 kt of chromium (contained in alloys) ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=The%20U,1%20billion%20during%202018)).  EU stainless output (~6 Mt/year) implies roughly 950 kt Cr use, and Japan (~2 Mt SS) ~320 kt Cr, for a total US+allies demand on the order of 1.8–2.0 million t Cr in 2020.  
- **2030 Projection:**  With stainless-steel demand projected to grow (Global SS production more than doubled 2010–2020 to ~63 Mt by 2020 ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/industrial-minerals/chrome-and-chromite/#:~:text=Global%20chromite%20production))), US/allied chromium demand could rise by 15–25% by 2030.  Conservatively, US+allies combined demand by 2030 may reach on the order of **2.2–2.5 million tonnes** of contained chromium (≈14–16% of forecast global SS).  (For reference, USGS and industry reports have noted U.S. demand ~0.55 Mt in 2018 ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=The%20U,1%20billion%20during%202018)); a 50–100 kt increase by 2030 is plausible given infrastructure and EV/defense growth.)  
- **Recycling Contribution:** Domestic stainless scrap recycling supplies ~25–30% of this demand. In 2018 the US recycled ~160 kt Cr from SS scrap ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=The%20U,1%20billion%20during%202018)), and Europe’s recycling is comparable; this is assumed to rise with SS scrap volumes. Thus, roughly **0.5–0.7 Mt/yr** may come from recycling by 2030. The rest (~1.5–1.8 Mt) must be met by mined chromite and ferrochrome imports.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
- **Mine Production:** Current allied mine output (~2.3 Mt ore from Finland + ~0.02 Mt from US) could increase with new projects: Outokumpu plans to double Kemi’s ore throughput to ~2.65–3.0 Mt/yr ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=Resource%20Evaluation%20To%20meet%20the,orebodies%20to%20yield%20the%20necessary)), and several Canadian/Oregon projects (e.g. Canada Chrome, Lelu, NewAge Metals) aim to come on-stream. Assuming Kemi ramps to ~3 Mt ore (≈0.8 Mt Cr) by 2030 and a startup mine producing ~0.1–0.2 Mt Cr (from 0.5–1 Mt ore) in N. America, allied mine supply could reach **~1.0 Mt Cr/year**.  
- **Recycling:** Combined US/EU stainless scrap recycling might supply ~0.6–0.8 Mt Cr by 2030. (US was ~0.16 Mt in 2018 ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=during%202018)); growth in corrosion-resistant steel and regulatory support suggest a rising trend in scrap reprocessing.)  
- **Chemical & Ferrochrome Production:** Little to none in US; Finland’s Kemi-Tornio integrated plant already produces ferrochrome using its ore. Assuming stable EU ferrochrome output (~350 kt FeCr containing ~200 kt Cr) and no new US smelters, imported ferrochrome will still fill any gap.  
- **Total Allied Supply:** Adding mining + recycling yields on order of **1.6–1.8 Mt Cr** available domestically by 2030.  Shortfall to meet demand (~2.2–2.5 Mt) implies continued import dependence on foreign ores/ferrochrome (mainly from S. Africa, Kazakhstan, etc.). (Figures reference Kemi’s expansion ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=Resource%20Evaluation%20To%20meet%20the,orebodies%20to%20yield%20the%20necessary)) and current scrap recovery ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/story/2023/06/03/critical-minerals/no-viable-substitute-for-critical-chromium/5768.html#:~:text=The%20U,1%20billion%20during%202018)).)

## Key Discovery Technologies  
- **Geologic Mapping & Targeting Ultramafics:** Identification of chromite requires mapping ophiolite and layered-mafic/ultramafic belts (peridotite-dunite cumulates). Classic examples (Bushveld, Great Dyke, Josephine Peridotite) guide prospecting. Geologists look for serpentinized ultramafic exposures and spinel-rich schists. Soil/rock geochemistry (anomalous Cr, Ni, Co, PGE) flags prospective intrusions.  
- **Airborne Geophysics:** Dense chromite bodies create distinctive gravity highs. Airborne or ground gravity surveys can highlight buried chromitite. For example, a detailed gravity survey in India’s Tangarparha chromite belt revealed a +16 mGal Bouguer anomaly corresponding to dense chromitite ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235933237_Integrated_geological_and_geophysical_studies_for_delineation_of_chromite_deposits-_A_case_study_from_Tangarparha_Orissa_India#:~:text=chromite%20were%20conducted%20in%20a,Chromite%20fragments%20recovered%20from%20pits)). Magnetics can also help where chromite is magnetite-rich. Geophysical data (gravity, magnetics, VLF-EM) when integrated with geology have successfully delineated concealed pods ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235933237_Integrated_geological_and_geophysical_studies_for_delineation_of_chromite_deposits-_A_case_study_from_Tangarparha_Orissa_India#:~:text=chromite%20were%20conducted%20in%20a,Chromite%20fragments%20recovered%20from%20pits)).  
- **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:** Identification of ultramafic rocks via multispectral imagery (AST-5, Sentinel-2) or drone-based sensors can trace silicate alteration halos. Index mapping of MgO, Ni, Cr-bearing minerals from satellite data can focus ground follow-up.  
- **GeoRoaming & AI:** Modern geochemical AI screening (multi-element anomaly detection) and machine learning on archive drill data (e.g. from past Ni/chrome programs) accelerate target discovery.  
- **Drilling & Chip Sampling:** Upon promising anomalies, RC or core drilling infills target zones. In-field XRF analysis of cores/soils quickly measures Cr₂O₃ grades. Linked exploration companies (e.g. Canada Chrome Company’s Ring of Fire drilling) combine all above tools.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
- **Underground Mining Methods:** Chromite ore is usually mined by mechanized drift-and-fill or bench cut-and-fill stoping. For steep, pipe-like deposits (e.g. Kemi), small-drift bench mining is typical. Outokumpu’s Kemi mine, for instance, used automated Diamec drilling and cut-and-fill stopes to reach deeper ore below 210 m depth ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=Extra%20production%20will%20initially%20be,will%20be%20extended%2C%20with%20new)). Bench-cut levels were driven at 350 m and 375 m, requiring ~11.5 km new tunnels ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=Extra%20production%20will%20initially%20be,will%20be%20extended%2C%20with%20new)).  
- **Rock Excavation:** Heavy drills (rotary or long-hole rigs) and jumbo excavators break the ore. Historically, cortege and hand mining were used (e.g. Chrome Queen, AK); modern operations use rubber-tired load-haul-dump (LHD) machines. Ventilation and rock support (mesh, bolts) ensure safety in serpentinite hosts.  
- **Ore Handling:** Broken rock is hauled by trucks or conveyors to surface. Outokumpu installed a new automated hoisting system to lift ore from 1,000 m depth efficiently ([www.outokumpu.com](https://www.outokumpu.com/en/locations/kemimine#:~:text=Outokumpu%20has%20finished%20a%20significant,of%20chrome%20for%20future%20decades)). Crushing plants at the mill feed the beneficiation circuit.  
- **Processing Plant:** On site, ore is comminuted (crushed+grinded). High-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) or autogenous mills can be used. Example data: Kemi’s mill was designed to grind ~1.3 Mtpy of ore to ~10–120mm for concentration ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=the%20heavy%20medium%20separation%20plant,3%20million%20mt%20in%202009)).  

## Key Separation Technologies  
- **Gravity Separation (Dense-Medium):** Primary beneficiation for chromite. Ore is crushed to liberation size and passed through dense-medium (ferrosilicon slurry) cyclones or jigs. At Kemi, a heavy-medium separation circuit upgrades run-of-mine (-0.1 to +120 mm) to a “lumpy” concentrate (~35% Cr₂O₃) and finer concentrate ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=the%20heavy%20medium%20separation%20plant,3%20million%20mt%20in%202009)). Shake tables, spiral concentrators, and spirals are also used for fine fractions.  
- **Magnetic/Electrostatic Separation:** Although chromite (Cr₂O₃) is weakly magnetic, ferromagnetic iron minerals can be removed with high-gradient magnetic separators, improving concentrate purity. Electrostatic separators (high-tension rollers) sometimes separate chromite from silicate gangue by conductivity differences.  
- **Flotation (Limited):** Flotation is not widely used for chromite (due to oxide surface). However, column flotation of chromite fines can recover ultrafines from waste streams ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304386X03001865#:~:text=ScienceDirect%20www,Abstract%20In)).  
- **Regrind & Cleaning:** Multiple-stage grinding and cleaning assists. Spiral concentrators and multi-gravity separators (MGS) can re-concentrate secondary tailings ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532012000500009&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=chromite%20processing%5E%7B3%2C26,0.1)). Indonesian industry also employs Roasting and leaching for refractory ores (though mostly outside allied domain).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
- **Ferrochrome Smelting:** Chromite concentrate is smelted in submerged-electric arc furnaces to produce ferrochrome (Fe–Cr alloy) containing 60–70% Cr (carbon added). This is by far the main route to chromium metal in alloys. Outokumpu’s Tornio Works uses electric furnaces to convert Kemi concentrate into high-carbon and low-carbon ferrochrome. The arc-furnace process is energy-intensive (requiring ~3,000–6,000 kWh/t Cr) and emits CO₂, but is proven industrially.  
  - *Example:* “Chrome ore is further processed into ferrochrome, which is a crucial raw material for stainless steel making” ([www.outokumpu.com](https://www.outokumpu.com/en/news/2025/outokumpu%E2%80%99s-mineral-reserves-in-kemi-chrome-mine-increased-by-95-3536649#:~:text=Chrome%20ore%20is%20further%20processed,the%20company%E2%80%99s%20integrated%20value%20chain)). Outokumpu’s integrated Kemi/Tornio chain is unique in housing mine-to-ferroalloy production under one company. No equivalent smelters operate in North America, so allied supply relies on this EU furnace and on imports of FeCr from South Africa/Kazakhstan (or from Outokumpu’s ferrochrome).  
- **Non-Ferrous Metal Production:**  Pure Cr metal (for special alloys, plating) can be made by aluminothermic reduction of Cr₂O₃ or by electrolysis in molten salts. Early research (U.S. Bureau of Mines) showed molten NaCl–CrCl₃ electrolysis yielding ductile Cr metal with <100 ppm O,N ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/electrorefining-chromium/#:~:text=The%20Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Mines,used%20as%20the%20anode%20connection)). Current practice: Cr metal (solid or powder) is niche, largely supplied from China/Kazakhstan.  
- **Chemical processing (Chromate route):** Alkali roasting followed by leaching converts chromite to sodium chromate (Na₂CrO₄), which can be further processed to chromium chemicals (CrO₃, CrCl₃, etc.). Though more applicable to foundry-grade ore, this route underpins production of dichromate pigments and plating salts. Allied companies (e.g. US base chemicals plants) rely on imported chromite or Na₂CrO₄; no large domestic operations exist.  
- **Secondary Refining:** Advanced refining (vacuum arc remelting, electroslag remelting) to produce superalloy-grade Cr or stainless steel billets uses small amounts of high-purity Cr and Ni. Allied metallurgical labs test impurities (S, P, C) to meet 4N+ purity for specialty applications.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
- **Tailings and Waste Rock Management:** Modern chromite mine closure emphasizes covering tailings with soil and vegetation to prevent dust, and constructing proper drainage. Chromite tailings (high in silicates, magnesium) are neutral or mildly alkaline (no acid mine drainage issues). However, fine chromite dust can pose silicosis risk; slurry containment and filtering are used.  
- **Chemical Stabilization:** Any Cr(VI) (if present from weathered chromate minerals) in waste can be chemically reduced to Cr(III). Adding ferrous sulfate or sulfide, or simple lime, precipitates Cr as insoluble hydroxides ([hjgc.ic-mag.com](https://hjgc.ic-mag.com/en/article/doi/10.13205/j.hjgc.202006001#:~:text=principle%20of%20reduction%20and%20stabilization,contaminated%20soil%20remediation%20projects%20currently)). This is standard in remediating contaminated soils (common around plating/pigment plants). Permeable reactive barriers (e.g. zero-valent iron walls) can treat seepage water.  
- **Phytoremediation & Bioremediation:** Certain plants and microbes can uptake or immobilize chromium. Research (e.g. arbuscular fungi) shows biologic transformation of Cr(VI) to trivalent forms ([hjgc.ic-mag.com](https://hjgc.ic-mag.com/en/article/doi/10.13205/j.hjgc.202006001#:~:text=principle%20of%20reduction%20and%20stabilization,contaminated%20soil%20remediation%20projects%20currently)). Hyperaccumulator plants (e.g. brake fern, Indian mustard) have been tested on chromite tailings. Field trials often involve adding compost or biochar to tailings to support native vegetation (Finnish trials show improved plant cover with organic amendments ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-021-14865-8#:~:text=Amending%20mine%20tailing%20cover%20with,Cite%20this))).  
- **Recycling of Process Water:** Historic processes (sodium dichromate plant residues) produced highly alkaline, Cr-laden slimes (e.g. US Freedom Industries site). Modern remediation in allied countries uses reverse osmosis, ion exchange or lime precipitation to clean effluents. For example, closed-loop water circuits and spent lime-stabilization are required in any new chromite concentrator.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Ferrochrome Production Capacity:** The crucial bottleneck is converting ore to usable ferrochrome domestically. There are no large ferrochrome smelters in the US or Canada (and only one in EU, at Outokumpu). Building a low-carbon electric-arc or alternative smelter is a critical need. Current industry must import ferrochrome or ore. Developing *direct reduction of chromite* (DRC) processes is therefore key. Innovative DRC methods (e.g. metallothermic or hydrogen-based reduction in aqueous/molten media) have been demonstrated in labs and pilot studies ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsengineeringau.3c00057#:~:text=Cite%20this%3A%20ACS%20Eng,2024%2C%204%2C%201%2C%20125%E2%80%93138)), but no commercial-scale plants exist yet. Scaling these “clean ferrochrome” technologies is the single biggest technical hurdle for a North America/EU chromium supply chain.  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
US and allied chromium production is limited only by processing, not ore availability ([www.womp-int.com](https://www.womp-int.com/story/2008vol8/story026c.htm#:~:text=Resource%20Evaluation%20To%20meet%20the,orebodies%20to%20yield%20the%20necessary)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235933237_Integrated_geological_and_geophysical_studies_for_delineation_of_chromite_deposits-_A_case_study_from_Tangarparha_Orissa_India#:~:text=chromite%20were%20conducted%20in%20a,Chromite%20fragments%20recovered%20from%20pits)).  The only significant mine (Outokumpu’s Kemi) has the ore, but converting it to ferrochrome at scale is energy-intensive and currently centralized. The lack of regional smelting/refining means even abundant chromite must be shipped abroad. New direct-reduction or low-energy smelting methods (currently at bench scale ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsengineeringau.3c00057#:~:text=Cite%20this%3A%20ACS%20Eng,2024%2C%204%2C%201%2C%20125%E2%80%93138))) are needed to break this bottleneck and enable fully domestic ferrochrome production.
