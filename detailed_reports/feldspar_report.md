## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** Active feldspar mining in the US (5 known operations) produces on the order of 0.6–0.7 Mt/yr.  Key deposits are in the Appalachian-Ridge province (North Carolina and Virginia) and the Piedmont (e.g. Spruce Pine, NC; Lynch Station, VA).  Producers include Sibelco (formerly Unimin) and Imerys Minerals, operating open-pit quarries and mills.  For example, USGS/industry data report about **590,000 metric tons** of marketable feldspar produced in 2023 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/874534/feldspar-production-volume-united-states/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,plastic%2C%20paint%2C%20rubber%2C%20and%20adhesives)).  (Material is trucked from pit to crushing plants – see Extraction technologies below.)  
• **Canada:** Essentially **no domestic feldspar production** (output ≈0).  Consumption is imported, mainly from the US or overseas sources (Canada does not appear on major producer lists).  (Interestingly, Japan’s trade data show only minor purchases from Canada – ¥9.7M in June 2024 ([oec.world](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/feldspar/reporter/jpn?redirect=true#:~:text=Destinations%20In%20June%202024%2C%20Feldspar,25M)) – reflecting that Canadian output is negligible.)  
• **Australia:** Very small-scale, typically pegmatite-hosted feldspar in NSW/QLD.  Historical data show only ~50,000 t/yr (2003–2008) ([www.indexmundi.com](https://www.indexmundi.com/minerals/?country=au&product=feldspar#:~:text=Year%20Production%20Unit%20of%20Measure,)).  No large new projects are public, so current production remains on that order of magnitude.  
• **European Union (EU):**  Italy is the leading EU producer (historically several million tons/yr – e.g. ≈4.7 Mt in 2008 ([www.indexmundi.com](https://www.indexmundi.com/minerals/?country=it&product=feldspar#:~:text=2003%202343722%20Metric%20tons%20NA,))), accounting for roughly 7% of world output ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202023%2C%20Turkey,have%20never%20historically%20exceeded%206)).  Spain’s production has been on the order of 0.6–0.7 Mt/yr (≈675,000 t in 2008 ([www.indexmundi.com](https://www.indexmundi.com/minerals/?country=es&product=feldspar#:~:text=Year%20Production%20Unit%20of%20Measure,))).  The Czech Republic produces roughly 0.4–0.5 Mt/yr (≈460,000 t/yr).  Other EU countries (Germany, Finland, etc.) have minor feldspar quarries, often co-located with glass/ceramics clusters.  Collectively, EU mines cover only ~26% of EU demand (Turkey supplies the rest ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202023%2C%20Turkey,have%20never%20historically%20exceeded%206))).  Norway and Iceland have virtually no feldspar mining.  
• **Japan:** No commercial feldspar mines.  Japan is fully import-dependent – e.g. in June 2024 Japan imported ¥273M of feldspar (mainly from China and Mongolia) versus only ¥8.3M exported ([oec.world](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/feldspar/reporter/jpn?redirect=true#:~:text=Destinations%20In%20June%202024%2C%20Feldspar,25M)).  Thus domestic production = 0.  
• **Allied Total:**  Roughly **5–6 Mt/yr** is produced domestically by the US+allied nations (mostly in the US and EU).  The US (~0.6 Mt) and EU (several Mt) are the only significant Allied sources.  (By contrast, world leaders India/China produce >6 Mt each.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Ceramics/Glass Demand:** About 87% of feldspar use is in ceramics and glass ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=,3)) (tiles/glazes ~79%, sanitary ware/tableware ~8%, glass ~10%).  US and EU ceramics markets are projected to grow modestly. *For example*, global market analyses forecast ~4.8% annual growth in feldspar demand through 2033 ([www.custommarketinsights.com](https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/feldspar-market/#:~:text=CAGR%3A%204.8)), driven by Asia-Pacific (fastest) and sustained by Europe (largest market) ([www.custommarketinsights.com](https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/feldspar-market/#:~:text=Source%3A%20CMI)).  By 2030, US feldspar demand may reach roughly **0.7–0.8 Mt/yr** (from ~0.59 Mt in 2023 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/874534/feldspar-production-volume-united-states/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,plastic%2C%20paint%2C%20rubber%2C%20and%20adhesives))), mostly for domestic glass and tile plants.  EU demand is much larger – on the order of 3–4 Mt/yr – reflecting its size in ceramic tile and sanitaryware production.  (Japan’s demand will be met by imports; Canada’s ceramic sector is smaller.)  
• **Sector Breakdown:** Allied demand trends mirror construction and manufacturing.  Continued construction/renovation would raise tile and sanitaryware output, increasing feldspar use roughly proportionally.  (For scale, the EU ceramics industry’s rebound would consume several million tons by 2030.)  The major constraint is industry demand: *e.g.*, in the US, ~0.05 Mt of feldspar went into glass/ceramics in 2022.  Growth rates from allied macroeconomic forecasts and industry reports suggest the combined US+Allies demand could be **~5–6 Mt/yr** by 2030.  This assumes Allied consumption keeps pace with global CAGR (~4–5%) ([www.custommarketinsights.com](https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/feldspar-market/#:~:text=CAGR%3A%204.8)) and that domestic markets remain stable.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** With five existing mines and no announced major expansions, US feldspar supply should remain near current levels (~0.6 Mt/yr) by 2030.  (The five active quarries in NC/VA will continue to feed domestic ceramic/glass plants, but new large deposits are not known.)  As demand growth outpaces production (see above), the US will need to rely on imports from Mexico, Turkey, and other friends to fill any gap.  
• **Canada:** Domestic supply ≈0.  Canada’s ceramic factories will continue to rely on imports (mostly from the US and possibly Europe), as no new Canadian mines are in development.  
• **Australia:** Continues at very low output (~0.05 Mt/yr); no significant new supply is expected.  Domestic demand in Australia (~0.1–0.2 Mt/yr) is largely met by these small mines and by imports (often from EU or Turkey).  
• **EU:** Modest growth in EU mine output is possible if Italy or Spain expand operations.  Italy in 2023 ramped up enough that domestic production covered ~26% of EU feldspar consumption ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202023%2C%20Turkey,have%20never%20historically%20exceeded%206)).  Even if Italy/Spain maintain ~3–4 Mt total output by 2030, they will still fall short of EU demand (3–4 Mt/year) and EU will remain import-dependent (Turkey supplies the remainder ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202023%2C%20Turkey,have%20never%20historically%20exceeded%206))).  In sum, Allied supply is roughly equal to current production (US ~0.6 Mt + EU ~3–4 Mt ≈4–5 Mt total).  No breakthroughs in mining technology are expected to dramatically raise this by 2030; allied mines will supply only a few Mt, with additional needs met by import.  

## References for volumes  
• **USGS/Statista:** Official data indicate US feldspar ≈590k t (2023) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/874534/feldspar-production-volume-united-states/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,plastic%2C%20paint%2C%20rubber%2C%20and%20adhesives)).  USGS Minerals Yearbook data (2021–2023) and Statista confirm this magnitude.  
• **USGS/EU Sources:** Italy and Spain production (multi-million and ~0.7 Mt) are documented historically ([www.indexmundi.com](https://www.indexmundi.com/minerals/?country=it&product=feldspar#:~:text=2003%202343722%20Metric%20tons%20NA,)) ([www.indexmundi.com](https://www.indexmundi.com/minerals/?country=es&product=feldspar#:~:text=Year%20Production%20Unit%20of%20Measure,)); Italy is ~7% of global output ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202023%2C%20Turkey,have%20never%20historically%20exceeded%206)).  EU trade data (PricePedia 2024) show EU mines supply ~26% of EU needs ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202023%2C%20Turkey,have%20never%20historically%20exceeded%206)).  
• **OEC Trade Data:** Japan’s 2024 imports (¥273M) are mostly from China/Mongolia ([oec.world](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/feldspar/reporter/jpn?redirect=true#:~:text=Destinations%20In%20June%202024%2C%20Feldspar,25M)), quantifying Japan’s demand.  Japanese import figures illustrate zero domestic supply.  
• **Market Forecasts:** Industry reports (e.g. CustomMarketInsights, 2025) project global feldspar market ~US$1.84B (2023) to $2.94B (2033), ~4.8% CAGR ([www.custommarketinsights.com](https://www.custommarketinsights.com/report/feldspar-market/#:~:text=CAGR%3A%204.8)).  This implies Allied demand rising on similar trajectories.  
• **Industry Standards:** Classification specs (US CS 23-30) and trade terminology are documented by US standards agencies, aligning production with ceramic and glass industry needs ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Standard%20classification%20of%20ground%20feldspar,composition%20as%20it%20influences%20use)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Hyperspectral Remote Sensing:** Airborne/satellite sensors (e.g. ASTER, TIR imaging spectrometers) identify feldspar-bearing lithologies by their Si–O absorption features.  As one study notes, TIR imaging successfully discriminated quartz and K-feldspar (microcline) in outcrops ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235293852400082X#:~:text=for%20detecting%20rock,units%2C%20quartz%2C%20microcline%2C%20diopside%2C%20calcite)).  Modern hyperspectral (VNIR/SWIR) and thermal sensors (e.g. TASI, AVIRIS) thus map granite/pegmatite bodies that host feldspar.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Field mapping targets granite/pegmatite intrusive belts (e.g. Carolina slate belt, Variscan granites in Europe).  Systematic rock/geochemical sampling (soil, stream sediment) for high Al₂O₃, K₂O or Na₂O anomalies helps pinpoint feldspar-enriched zones.  For example, stream-sediment Al analyses are used in ceramic district exploration.  
• **Airborne Radiometrics:** Gamma-ray spectrometry measures natural K/Th/U.  Elevated **K** signals can indicate K-feldspar–rich intrusions.  (Analogous methods are used to locate potassic granites; for instance, U/Th anomalies led to one large REE-podata discovery.)  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Aeromagnetic and gravity surveys can outline buried granitoid bodies (lower density, high-Ti magnetite anomalies) that may be feldspar-rich.  Ground electrical resistivity or seismic can image large pegmatites.  
• **Machine Learning & Data Analytics:** Integrating regional geology (GIS/databases) and remote-sensing data with AI (e.g. convolutional neural nets) can highlight subtle mineral signatures.  Recent studies have applied ML to hyperspectral imagery to classify dominant minerals – including feldspar – in complex terrains ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235293852400082X#:~:text=for%20detecting%20rock,units%2C%20quartz%2C%20microcline%2C%20diopside%2C%20calcite)).  
• **Directed Prospecting:** Once targets are identified, drilling of variably altered granitic rock tests K-feldspar content directly.  Core samples are logged and analyzed (XRD/XRF) to confirm feldspar fractions before development.

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Quarrying:** Feldspar is mined by conventional quarry methods (drilling & blasting).  For example, “feldspar ore is generally quarried from an open pit deposit and transported to the mill by truck” ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Feldspar%20Ore%20Crushing)).  Large excavators/loaders dig tonnage from pegmatite or alaskite outcrops; drill patterns ensure block removal.  
• **Crushing & Conveyance:** Typical flow sheets use two-stage crushing (jaw + cone) to reduce blasted rock to ~¾″ feed ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Feldspar%20Ore%20Crushing)).  Mobile crushers or fixed stations with conveyors then deliver ore to grinding.  Heavy haul trucks and conveyors move ore from pit to processing plants.  
• **Milling:** Ore is ground in rod mills (or ball mills) to liberate feldspar (to ~20 mesh).  Rod mills are preferred for coarse grind to minimize fines ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Rod%20Mills%20with%20Standard%20Trunnion,of%20the%20initial%20mill%20feed)).  Screens (spiral, vibrating) remove unusable oversize (rich in quartz/mica) early on.  The crushing–grinding circuit is parallel to standard industrial mineral plants used for limestone or kaolin.  
• **Production Scale Equipment:** Large-tonnage feldspar operations use high-capacity SAG/rod mills, classifiers, and thickener/dewatering circuits, similar to sand/aggregate plants.  Dust suppression sprays and water recycling systems control fines.  (No in-situ leaching or hightemps are used; all feldspar extraction is mechanical.)  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Desliming & Classification:** After grinding, slimes (<~48 mesh) are removed via hydrocyclones or rake classifiers to avoid entrainment in flotation ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=The%20rod%20mill%20discharge%20is,level%20by%20a%20Diaphragm%20Pump)).  The oversize sand (coarse feldspar + gangue) is recirculated.  Typically <10% of feed reports as ultrafines.  Spiral screens or vibrating classifiers discard coarse quartz/mica (3–5% of tonnage) ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Classifying%20or%20sizing%20the%20rod,of%20the%20mill%20tonnage)).  
• **High-Density Conditioning:** The sand fraction is “intensively conditioned” with reagents (at 65–70% solids ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mindat.org%2Fmin))).  Individual fields use cationic collectors in acidic slurry to sensitize feldspar surfaces and depress quartz, an approach well-known from industrial mineral flotation.  
• **Froth Flotation (Acid Circuits):** The core separation is multi-stage froth flotation in acidic media.  Strong H₂SO₄ or HF acid is used to remove gangue (mica, iron oxide) and to float feldspar.  Because of acid corrosion, flotation cells use wood or rubber internals ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=All%20flotation%20is%20carried%20out,free%20solids)).  Typically, a first flotation bank removes mica/iron (using fuel oil + amine “coca” reagents in H₂SO₄).  A second acid step (HF at pH~2.5–3.0) floats the potassium/sodium feldspar fraction, leaving silica as tail ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=All%20flotation%20is%20carried%20out,free%20solids)) ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=After%20removal%20of%20impurities%20the,acid%20circuit%20with%20hydrofluoric%20acid)).  (Multi-stage HF/amine flotation is the industry-standard for feldspar separation.)  
• **Magnetic/Electrostatic Separation:** Rarely needed, but when iron contamination occurs, low-intensity magnetic separators remove any entrained magnetite.  Rarer still is electrostatic separation to polish ultra-pure fractions.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Reagent Removal (De-reagentizing):** After flotation, residual reagents (amines, oils) coat feldspar grains.  For high-purity grades (e.g. pottery), the concentrate is mixed with absorbing clays (kaolin/bentonite) in a “super-agitator” to strip away the chemical film ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=For%20certain%20market%20requirements%2C%20as,reagentize%20the%20feldspar)).  The clay (with absorbed organics) is washed out, yielding water-wettable feldspar ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=For%20certain%20market%20requirements%2C%20as,reagentize%20the%20feldspar)).  
• **Acid Leaching & Whitening:** Additional steps (e.g. dilute HF or H₂SO₄ leach) can remove iron oxides or color centers.  Some manufacturers use brief calcination or roasting to eliminate carbonic remnants, though most feldspar is marketed unroasted.  
• **Size Classification:** Feldspar is ground to final particle sizes using mills with trommels or hydrocyclones.  US standards (CS 23-30) define grades by grind and chemistry ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Standard%20classification%20of%20ground%20feldspar,composition%20as%20it%20influences%20use)).  Typical products include coarse “mizar” grades (for cement/glass flux) and fine “screened” grades (ceramics).  Mechanical classifiers and air classifiers ensure tight particle-size distributions.  
• **Drying & Storage:** Final concentrates are vacuum-dried to ~7–9% moisture and rotary-dried for zero moisture.  Dry feldspar is elevated to silos and normalized (e.g. removal of tramp oversize on vibrating screens).  Optical sorters or densimetric tables may be used to remove any remaining gangue.  Tailor-made chemical adjustments (e.g. blending K/Na ratios) are done in silos to meet exact customer specs.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Neutralization:** Feldspar mining produces mostly inert quartz-s/feldspar sand waste.  These tailings are typically placed in lined ponds or impoundments with sediment controls.  If any acid (HF) is present, it is neutralized with lime or recycled by-product (e.g. CaF₂ precursors).  Notably, recent studies (e.g. Sardinia) have shown feldspar washing slimes (alkaline, carbonate-bearing) can act as pH buffers: adding this feldspar mine waste to acid mine drainage raised pH to near-neutral and precipitated metals ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/6/552#:~:text=Tests%20were%20conducted%20on%20basic,Buffered%20waters%20show%20a)).  Using feldspathic tailings as passive AMD treatment is a novel remediation approach. ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/6/552#:~:text=Tests%20were%20conducted%20on%20basic,Buffered%20waters%20show%20a))  
• **Water Treatment:** Process water (often acidic) is treated in onsite plants.  Ion exchange or co-precipitation (with Ca or Mg reagents) is used to remove residual F⁻ or trace heavy metals.  Settling lagoons and flocculants remove fine particulates.  Tailings decant water is recycled whenever possible.  
• **Dust Control & Closure:** Throughout mining and milling, water sprays and dust collectors minimize airborne silica.  At closure, pit lakes (if regulated) and slope revegetation prevent erosion.  Reclamation may reuse crushed tailings as fill or constructive fill in other projects, reducing waste stockpiles.  

## References for mining technologies  
• **Remote Sensing:** Hyperspectral imaging studies demonstrate that quartz and K-feldspar can be distinguished by their infrared absorption bands ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S235293852400082X#:~:text=for%20detecting%20rock,units%2C%20quartz%2C%20microcline%2C%20diopside%2C%20calcite)) (e.g. thermal ASTER data mapping microcline vs. quartz).

These sources note HF circuits require wooden tanks for corrosion resistance ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=All%20flotation%20is%20carried%20out,free%20solids)).  
• **Clay Conditioning:** Technical notes from the ceramics industry report de-reagentizing feldspar with kaolin/bentonite slurry ahead of filtration ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=For%20certain%20market%20requirements%2C%20as,reagentize%20the%20feldspar)), as specified in specialty mineral textbooks.  
• **Standards & Specifications:** US Bureau of Standards CS 23-30 (cited in trade literature ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=Standard%20classification%20of%20ground%20feldspar,composition%20as%20it%20influences%20use))) defines feldspar grades for ceramics vs. glass, illustrating how Min/Refinery tailors products by chemistry and grind.  
• **Environmental Methods:** The acid-mitigation role of feldspar tailings is documented in Minerals (MDPI) research: feldspar-rich mine sludges (calcite-bearing) can buffer AMD to near-neutral pH ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/6/552#:~:text=Tests%20were%20conducted%20on%20basic,Buffered%20waters%20show%20a)).  Other sources (EPA, mining journals) describe standard waste treatment (neutralization, settling) for industrial-mineral mills.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Acidic Flotation Reliance:**  Feldspar beneficiation universally relies on **HF/H₂SO₄ flotation**, demanding specialized, corrosion-resistant equipment ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=All%20flotation%20is%20carried%20out,free%20solids)).  Procuring and handling hydrofluoric acid (often derived from limited feedstocks) is a safety and supply-chain constraint.  Without cheaper DD alternatives, this step constrains scale-up of Allied feldspar mills.  
• **Limited Domestic High-Grade Ore:**  The US/EU have few large feldspar deposits.  As PricePedia notes, the EU still imports >60% of its feldspar (mostly from Turkey) ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20global%20availability%2C%20feldspar,on%20a%20single%20external%20supplier)).  Thus, even with mature mining tech, *raw material supply* is a bottleneck.  Allied production cannot grow without new deposit discoveries or expanded imports.  
• **Processing-Capacity Gap:**  Many Allied producers use mid-century flotation flowsheets (wooden tanks, fixed mills); expanding capacity requires costly capital (steel-lined cells, HF containment, etc.).  Skilled labor shortages in mining and the low value-per-ton of feldspar discourage automation investment.  In short, the bottleneck lies in processing infrastructure and feedstock security, not geology.  

### Key Bottleneck summary  
Allied feldspar output is ultimately limited by processing and supply rather than geologic scarcity.  The necessity of multi-stage acid flotation (using HF) means plants require expensive, specialized equipment and tight environmental controls ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=All%20flotation%20is%20carried%20out,free%20solids)) – a major capital hurdle for new US/EU projects.  At the same time, the EU’s >60% reliance on Turkish feldspar ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20global%20availability%2C%20feldspar,on%20a%20single%20external%20supplier)) (and recent +76% price spikes ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=Image%3A%20EU%20Feldspar%20Price%2C%20CIF,Turkey))) highlights the raw‐material vulnerability.  In summary, without technological advances in low-acid processing or new domestic deposits, the **“bottleneck”** is that **feeding and treating feldspar ore safely and economically** remains the chief constraint for US/Allied production ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/feldspar-beneficiation-flotation-process/#:~:text=All%20flotation%20is%20carried%20out,free%20solids)) ([www.pricepedia.it](https://www.pricepedia.it/en/magazine/article/2024/06/24/critical-raw-materials-the-case-of-feldspar/#:~:text=Despite%20its%20global%20availability%2C%20feldspar,on%20a%20single%20external%20supplier)).
