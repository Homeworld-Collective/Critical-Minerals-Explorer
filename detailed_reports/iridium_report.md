## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** Effectively zero. The Stillwater Mine (Montana, Sibanye-Stillwater) produces primarily Pd/Pt ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/724133454/mcs2023-platinum-group-quantities-of-metals#:~:text=Mine%20production%3A1%20Palladium%2014%2C300%2014%2C300,1%2C020%20875%201%2C620%202%2C310%201%2C700)); USGS reports no separate Ir output. USIr imports in 2022 were ~1,700 kg ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/724133454/mcs2023-platinum-group-quantities-of-metals#:~:text=Iridium%201%2C020%20875%201%2C620%202%2C310,11%2C200%2013%2C900%2018%2C000%2015%2C000%20Exports%3A4)), implying domestic production ≈0.  
• **Canada:** Minor byproduct output (~0.3 t in 2022) from Ontario PGM and Ni/Cu mines ([w3ask.com](https://w3ask.com/iridium-producing-countries/#:~:text=South%20Africa%20%20,information)). Lac des Iles (Ontario) is Canada’s only dedicated PGM mine (mainly Pd/Pt) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=Canada%20has%20one%20dedicated%20PGM,PGMs%20as%20their%20primary%20commodities)); Ir is recovered only in trace.  
• **Australia/EU/Norway/Iceland/Japan:** No active Ir mines. (Australia mines nickel/Cu but recovers negligible Ir; Europe and Japan import all needs.) Allied total production is essentially nil. For context, global mined Ir was only ~250,000 oz (~7.8 t) in 2022 ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,of%20a%20perceived%20iridium%20bottleneck)), so any US/allied output is a negligible fraction.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Hydrogen PEM Electrolysis:** The dominant driver.  Industrial plans in the US, EU, Japan and Australia target tens of GW of PEM capacity by 2030.  For example, the Hydrogen Council projects ~80–100 GW global by 2030 – scaling  such that 20 GW (≈US/EU+Japan share) would need ~250,000 oz (~7.8 t) of Ir at today’s 400 kg/GW loadings ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,of%20a%20perceived%20iridium%20bottleneck)).  With catalyst “thrifting” (aiming for ~80 kg/GW by 2030) this falls to a few tonnes (20 GW→≲1.6 t) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Iridium%20thrifting%20and%20design%20efficiency,and%20Heraeus%20cites%20the%20next)).  Roughly, US/allied hydrogen demand alone could be on the order of 5–10 t/yr by 2030.  
• **Automotive/Industrial (Spark Plugs, Catalysts):** Current Ir uses include platinum-metal spark-plug electrodes (mainly Knobs/Wires) and chemical catalysts.  These are modest compared to hydrogen.  WPIC notes that Ir substitution (e.g. in spark plugs) could free up ~45–67 koz (1.4–2.1 t) globally by 2030 ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=the%20past%20three%20years,2)), partly offsetting demand.  Allied automotive demand is thus on the order of 1–2 t/yr by 2030 (declining as EVs rise).  
• **Other Uses (Electronics, Glass, Oil):** Each is very small (<0.5 t) and not expected to grow.  Iridium crucibles, electrical contacts and niche catalysts will add only a few hundred kg/year.  Overall US/allied demand for 2030 is estimated at **~5–10 tonnes** per year (dominated by PEM hydrogen).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Mining (Domestic):** Essentially 0.  No new iridium mines are on the horizon in US or allied countries.  Existing nickel and platinum operations (e.g. Sudbury, Stillwater) will produce any Ir only as an unavoidable trace byproduct.  Thus primary supply stays at current near-zero levels.  
• **Recycling (Secondaries):** Growing contributor. Stranded Iridium in used catalysts and electronics will be recovered: the US “Hydrogen shot” targets ~99% PGM recovery from electrolyser catalysts by the 2030s ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20the%20third%20pillar,2030%20%28PEM)).  In practice, spent PEM CCMs (7–10 yr life) will re-enter the supply chain around 2030. While exact volumes are uncertain, WPIC estimates that recovering just ~10% of non-PEM Ir (e.g. from spark plugs) could meet future shortfalls ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=iridium%20supply%20net%20of%20closed,Nevertheless%2C%20evaluating%20cumulative)). By 2030, closed-loop recycling might supply on the order of 1–2 t/yr of Ir to US/allies, partially offsetting imports.  
• **Imports/External:** All other supply must come from foreign mines (S. Africa, Russia, etc.).  With domestic mine output essentially zero, US/allies remain ~100% import-reliant (USGS PGM data show net import reliance >60% for Pt/Pd ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/724133454/mcs2023-platinum-group-quantities-of-metals#:~:text=Net%20import%20reliance6%2C%208%20as,74%2067%2075%2072%2066)); for Ir it is effectively 100%).  

## References for volumes  
• **Global production:** USGS/WPIC data show ~250,000 troy oz Ir mined in 2022 (~7.8 t) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,of%20a%20perceived%20iridium%20bottleneck)). S. Africa dominated with ~6,160 kg in 2022; Zimbabwe ~437 kg ([w3ask.com](https://w3ask.com/iridium-producing-countries/#:~:text=South%20Africa%20%20,information)), Canada ~300 kg ([w3ask.com](https://w3ask.com/iridium-producing-countries/#:~:text=South%20Africa%20%20,information)), Russia ~200 kg ([w3ask.com](https://w3ask.com/iridium-producing-countries/#:~:text=South%20Africa%20%20,information)). No data are reported for US or other allied producers.  
• **US production:** USGS PGM chapter lists 2022 Pd/Pt mine output (~11.0 t Pd, 3.3 t Pt) but no Ir ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/724133454/mcs2023-platinum-group-quantities-of-metals#:~:text=Mine%20production%3A1%20Palladium%2014%2C300%2014%2C300,1%2C020%20875%201%2C620%202%2C310%201%2C700)), while Ir imports were 1,700 kg ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/724133454/mcs2023-platinum-group-quantities-of-metals#:~:text=Iridium%201%2C020%20875%201%2C620%202%2C310,11%2C200%2013%2C900%2018%2C000%2015%2C000%20Exports%3A4)). US domestic Ir mine output is therefore ~0.  
• **Canadian production:** Natural Resources Canada reports Canada’s 2023 PGM mine output 702,000 oz (Pd/Pt) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Canadian%20mines%20produced,Manitoba%2C%20and%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador)). Cited stats indicate ~0.3 t Iridium (2022) ([w3ask.com](https://w3ask.com/iridium-producing-countries/#:~:text=South%20Africa%20%20,information)).  
• **Demand forecast:** Hydrogen Council/IEA scenarios (80–100 GW global by 2030) imply ~30–40 t Ir over 8 yrs at current loadings ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=of%20iridium%20use%20will%20not,Increasing)). WPIC specifically notes ~250 koz (7.8 t) for 20 GW in 2030 ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,of%20a%20perceived%20iridium%20bottleneck)). Thrifting to 80 kg/GW could cut that to ~5–10 t ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=of%20iridium%20use%20will%20not,Increasing)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Iridium%20thrifting%20and%20design%20efficiency,and%20Heraeus%20cites%20the%20next)).  
• **Supply forecast:** Johnson Matthey and WPIC show that with recycling and thrifting, cumulative PEM Ir demand can be met by 2050 ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=of%20iridium%20use%20will%20not,Increasing)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20the%20third%20pillar,Nevertheless%2C%20evaluating%20cumulative)). This implies allied supply needs ~5–10 t/yr by 2030, mostly via recycled Ir.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Target known PGM host rocks (layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions, komatiites, orogenic belts).  Detailed field mapping identifies nickel-copper-PGE sulfide layers or chrome-rich horizons.  Geochemical sampling of soils, rocks and glacial tills for PGE tracers (Pd, Pt, Ni, Os) highlights anomalies. For example, Canada’s Lac des Iles deposit (Ontario) occurs in ultramafic/flood-basalt complex ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=Canada%20has%20one%20dedicated%20PGM,Ontario%20specifically%20targeting%20PGMs%20as)). NRCan notes three advanced PGM exploration projects in northern Ontario targeting such intrusives ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts#:~:text=Canada%20has%20one%20dedicated%20PGM,Ontario%20specifically%20targeting%20PGMs%20as)).  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Airborne and ground methods detect PGE-bearing bodies.  Strongly magnetic or dense (gravity) signatures indicate mafic intrusions (Dense norite/gabbro).  Modern explorers use induced-polarization (IP) and electromagnetic (EM) surveys: IP detects disseminated sulfides (high chargeability), EM finds conductive sulfide veins.  (E.g. at Montana’s Stillwater West, Group Ten Metals used large IP/airborne EM surveys to define high‐chargeability/conductivity zones associated with Pd–Pt mineralization ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2020/group-ten-metals-completes-drill-program-and-large-scale-geophysical-survey-reports-11-g-t-palladium-platinum-and-0.70-nickel/#:~:text=within%20broader%20geophysical%20and%20geochemical,along%20trend%20and%20to%20depth)) ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2020/group-ten-metals-completes-drill-program-and-large-scale-geophysical-survey-reports-11-g-t-palladium-platinum-and-0.70-nickel/#:~:text=Induced%20Polarization%20)).)  
• **Remote Sensing:** Hyperspectral satellite or drone imagery maps alteration minerals (chlorite, serpentine, magnetite) that typically accompany ultramafic intrusions. Structural lineaments and geochemical anomalies are also picked out via multi-spectral analysis.  
• **Heavy-Mineral Sampling:** Stream sediment and till panning can concentrate tiny PGE grains (e.g. chromite with IrOs inclusions).  Specialized laboratory analysis (PGM grain counts or isotope fingerprinting) helps trace-source buried deposits. By analogy, similar techniques are used to find legacy PGE deposits in glaciated terrains.  
• **Data-Driven Prospecting:** Machine‐learning prospectivity mapping (integrating geology, geochem, geophysics) can highlight overlooked PGE targets.  For instance, guides from known districts (Bushveld, Stillwater) inform regional exploration models that direct field surveys in allied jurisdictions ([criticalminerals.com](https://criticalminerals.com/news/2020/group-ten-metals-completes-drill-program-and-large-scale-geophysical-survey-reports-11-g-t-palladium-platinum-and-0.70-nickel/#:~:text=Group%20Ten%20is%20targeting%20world,with%20South%20Africa%E2%80%99s%20Bushveld%20complex)).  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Ore Concentration (Flotation):** PGM ores (often Ni-Cu sulfides or PtReOs alloys) are finely ground and floated. Reagents preferentially float sulfides; PGM minerals (e.g. sperrylite, iridosmine) report to sulfide concentrates.  This yields a concentrate rich in Ni, Cu and PGMs. (E.g. Stillwater and Sudbury plants use differential flotation to produce Ni–Cu–PGE matte.)  
• **Sulphide Smelting & Matte Smelting:** Concentrates are smelted (flash or electric furnace) to matte. Base metals (Ni, Cu, Fe) are reduced to matte phases, while PGMs and gold remain in the dense sulfide or “anode sludge.”  For example, Sudbury/Norilsk flash heat condenses Pt–Ir in anode slimes during Ni refining.  
• **Pressure Oxidation or Chlorination:** To liberate PGMs, mattes or sludges are oxidized. The traditional Mond–Kell process (Ni) or Kaldo converter (matte oxidation) produces a molten matte–slag, with a PGM-rich slag or slimes. Alternatively, chlorination of slimes (using chlorine/oxygen gas) dissolves Rh and Pd, leaving IrO2.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** The PGM-bearing intermediate (powder or sponge) is dissolved. Aqua regia (HCl+HNO₃) or chlorine gas is commonly used to dissolve platinum-group metals into chloride solutions ([www.pgmmetals.com](https://www.pgmmetals.com/the-process-of-refining-iridium-how-to-recover-iridium/#:~:text=broken%20and%20ground%20to%20facilitate,sintering%20or%20melting%20at%20high)). (JOHNS MATTHEY notes that Ir is very corrosion-resistant; dissolution often requires refluxing aqua regia or “dry” chlorination ([www.pgmmetals.com](https://www.pgmmetals.com/the-process-of-refining-iridium-how-to-recover-iridium/#:~:text=broken%20and%20ground%20to%20facilitate,sintering%20or%20melting%20at%20high)).)  
• **Catalytic & Electrochemical Methods:** In some flowsheets, electrorefining is employed. Crude PGM solution is plated (e.g. on steel wool cathodes) to recover platinum, whilst iridium remains in solution for separate recovery. Special catalysts (e.g. platinum black) may be used to precipitate certain PGMs selectively.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Selective Precipitation:** Iridium(IV) in chloride solution forms very stable [IrCl₆]²⁻.  Addition of excess NH₄Cl precipitates ammonium hexachloroiridate, (NH₄)₂[IrCl₆] ([www.pgmmetals.com](https://www.pgmmetals.com/the-process-of-refining-iridium-how-to-recover-iridium/#:~:text=in%20the%20solution%2C%20such%20as,sintering%20or%20melting%20at%20high)).  This is filtered off (other PGMs remain dissolved or precipitate differently). The solid Ir salt is then calcined/sintered to IrO₂, which is reduced to metal.  
• **Solvent Extraction / Ion‐Exchange:** Liquid–liquid extraction uses organic solvents (e.g. TBP, amines) that selectively pull PGM chloro-complexes into an organic phase. Anion-exchange resins (Cl⁻ form) can also absorb [IrCl₆]²⁻ from HCl media, separating it from base metals and Pd/Pt. Subsequent stripping yields purified Ir solution.  
• **Osmium Distillation:** If traces of osmium remain, it is removed by mild oxidative roasting (to volatile OsO₄) and distillation. This leaves Ir behind.  
• **Electrolysis:** In specialized processes, Iridium can be plated out from solution (e.g., on Pt or steel electrodes) at controlled potentials, separating it from other metals. This is less common at large scale.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **High‐Temperature Melting/Sintering:** Iridium’s low reactivity and high melting point (~2,447 °C) demand extreme heat.  The precipitated Ir salt or oxide is typically calcined and hydrogen-reduced to spongy Ir powder, then consolidated. Electric arc furnaces or plasma torches (often water-cooled “cold crucible” induction furnaces) melt Ir into ingots ([www.pgmmetals.com](https://www.pgmmetals.com/the-process-of-refining-iridium-how-to-recover-iridium/#:~:text=in%20the%20solution%2C%20such%20as,higher%20purity%20of%20iridium%20metal)).  
• **Zone Refining:** Directional solidification (zone melting) further purifies Iridium. A localized melt zone is passed along a solid Ir rod, driving impurities to one end.  Repeated passes yield >99.99% purity metal.  
• **Powder Metallurgy:** Alternatively, pressed Ir powder (from hydrometallurgy) is hot-forged or extruded into bars/rods. Post-sintering anneals relieve stress and refine grain structure.  
• **Electrolytic Refining:** A copper-nickel type refining can be used: Ir anodes in chloride baths can deposit Ir (or Osmium) on cathodes. This is more typical for Pt/Pd than for Ir, but it is applicable for final polishing of Ir metal.  
• **Alloying/Forming:** Pure Ir is often alloyed for workability (e.g. 5% W or Os). Metallurgical processes like cold/hot rolling and swaging produce wire and sheet. Final products (e.g. high‐density Ir fixtures) may be zone-melted again to eliminate residuals.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Effluent Neutralization & Treatment:** Hydrometallurgical processes produce acidic waste (HCl, HNO₃) containing trace metals.  These are treated with lime or limestone to neutralize pH and precipitate metals as hydroxides, preventing release of residual Ni, Cu or minor PGMs.  
• **Regeneration/Recycling of Chemicals:** Spent acid and ammonia streams are recycled. For example, spent chlorination liquors are treated in caustic scrubbers or ion-exchange circuits to recover and reuse chlorine/nitrogen reagents, minimizing effluent volume.  
• **Solvent Recovery:** Spent organic solvents (from SX circuits) are distilled to re-concentrate extractants and remove dissolved metals, greatly reducing waste.  
• **Particulate Control:** Air emissions (SO₂ from roasting or smelting) are handled by wet scrubbers or “Adam process” converters to form sulfuric acid, which can be captured or reused ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=produced%20as%20a%20minor%20by,will%20continue%20to%20be%20produced)). High-temperature filter bags and precipitators trap any iridium dust or fly-ash.  
• **Catalyst/Sludge Handling:** Sludges containing Ir and other PGMs (from precipitation or polishing) are filtered, dried, and returned to the refining stage (closed-loop recovery). Spent Plating/Waste PGMs are sent to specialized recyclers who dissolve and reconcentrate them (as described above). This “closed loop” recycling prevents environmental release of Ir and concentrates it for reuse ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=specifically%20South%20Africa%20and%20Zimbabwe%2C,will%20continue%20to%20be%20produced)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20the%20third%20pillar,2030%20%28PEM)).

These studies drive R&D in Ir usage efficiency and recovery, effectively shaping which technologies must mature in allied supply chains.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The single greatest bottleneck is *catalyst efficiency and recycling*, not mining.  Since no new Western iridium mines are forthcoming, US/allied supply hinges on reducing per-unit Ir demand and recapturing spent material.  Johnson Matthey emphasizes that Ir loadings in PEM electrolysers must plunge (from ~400 kg/GW to ~80 kg/GW by 2030) to keep demand within supply ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=reused,efficiency%20of%20raw%20materials%20use)).  Likewise, WPIC notes that achieving nearly 100% recycling of Iridium catalysts (US goal ~99% recovery of PGM media) is essential ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20the%20third%20pillar,2030%20%28PEM)).  In short, advances in catalyst **thrifting** and closed-loop **recycling/refinement** are the key technological constraints for US/allied Iridium availability.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
U.S. and allied Iridium production is constrained by geology; essentially no domestic ore deposits exist to mine.  Instead, supply growth depends on technology that stretches or recycles the material.  Achieving very low Ir loadings in PEM fuel/electrolyser catalysts and near-full recycling of spent catalysts are identified as the limiting factors ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=reused,efficiency%20of%20raw%20materials%20use)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years?category=&page=2&term=#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20the%20third%20pillar,2030%20%28PEM)).  Put simply, without breakthroughs in catalyst design and recovery processes, Ir shortage will bottleneck the allied hydrogen transition and related technologies.
