## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Catalyst thrifting to <80 kg/GW; 95%+ recycling efficiency; membrane electrode assembly recovery*

The single greatest bottleneck is **catalyst efficiency and recycling**, not mining. Iridium is produced only as a by-product of platinum-group metal (PGM) mining (≈95% from South Africa/Zimbabwe; ≈5% from Russia/Canada) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)), and no new primary Ir mines are planned in the US or other Western countries.  Therefore US/allied supply growth depends entirely on reducing per-unit Ir demand and recapturing spent material.  Johnson Matthey emphasizes that current PEM electrolyser Ir usage (~400 kg/GW) must fall dramatically; for example, JM notes that 75–80% thrifting to ≈80 kg/GW by 2030 is being targeted ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%20thrifting%20and%20design%20efficiency,to%2030%20kg%2FGW%20by%202050)).  Similarly, >95% recovery of Ir from spent catalyst (MEA) units is essential – for instance, the US DOE’s hydrogen roadmap calls for nearly closed-loop PGM recycling in electrolyzers by the mid-2030s ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=The%20US%E2%80%99s%20clean%20hydrogen%20roadmap,Nevertheless%2C%20evaluating%20cumulative)) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)). Without these advances in catalyst design and recovery, Iridium scarcity could severely constrain the scaling of PEM hydrogen technologies ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=iridium%20requirements%20over%20three%20ten,annum%20by%20the%20early%202030s)).

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: <0.1 tons/year*

- **United States:** Essentially zero. No dedicated Ir mines exist; the Stillwater (Montana) PGM mine produces Pd/Pt, and USGS data report no separate Ir production. The US is almost entirely import-dependent for Ir ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,iridium%2C%20consuming%20total%20annual%20supply)).
- **Canada:** Negligible byproduct output.  Canada’s only PGM mine, Lac des Îles (Ontario), is a late-Archean mafic–ultramafic intrusion hosting Pd–Pt with minor Ir (≈20×10^6 t of ore, 6.3 g/t total PGE) ([cdnsciencepub.com](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/e89-120#:~:text=The%20Lac%20des%20Iles%20Complex,Distinct%20magma)).  Iridium is recovered only in trace amounts as a byproduct of Ni/Cu/PGM ore milling, on the order of a few hundred kilograms per year.
- **Australia, EU, Norway, Iceland, Japan, etc.:**  No primary Ir production.  Australia has nickel/Cu sulfide mines with negligible Ir, and Europe/Japan import virtually all Ir.  Thus total Western “production” is effectively nil.  For context, industry sources estimate global primary Iridium mine output at only ~190,000 troy ounces (~5.9 tonnes) in 2022, with total supply (including recycling) around 250,000 oz (~7.8 t) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,iridium%2C%20consuming%20total%20annual%20supply)) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 3–6 tons/year (allied total)*

- **Hydrogen PEM Electrolysis:** The dominant driver.  Announced PEM hydrogen projects in the US, EU, Japan, etc. target many tens of gigawatts by 2030.  (For example, the Hydrogen Council/IEA scenario envisages ~80–100 GW global PEM by 2030).  At today’s catalyst loading (~400 kg/GW), each 20 GW of new capacity would require ≈8 tonnes of Ir ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=of%20iridium%20use%20will%20not,mined%20each%20year%2C%20never%20mind)).  Thrifting strategies (to ~80 kg/GW) would cut this dramatically – e.g. 20 GW at 80 kg/GW uses ≈1.6 t.  Even so, accelerated capacity additions imply annual Ir demand in the low single-digit tonnes by 2030.  Industry analysts estimate U.S./EU/Japan needs could approach a few tonnes per year of new Iridium by 2030 ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=of%20iridium%20use%20will%20not,mined%20each%20year%2C%20never%20mind)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%20thrifting%20and%20design%20efficiency,to%2030%20kg%2FGW%20by%202050)).
- **Automotive/Industrial:** Current Ir use in spark-plug electrodes and specialty catalysts is modest and likely to decline (EV adoption).  High Ir prices have spurred substitute technologies.  WPIC forecasts that up to 20–30% of traditional Ir end-use (e.g. spark plugs) could be replaced by 2030 ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=the%20past%20three%20years,2)), freeing roughly 45–67 koz (1.4–2.1 t) globally over the next decade.  Thus US/allied automotive and other catalyst demand is only on the order of a few hundred kilograms to perhaps ~1 t/yr by 2030.
- **Other Uses (Electronics, Glass, Crucibles):** Each is small.  Iridium oxide in OLED/LED, electrical contacts, and high-temperature crucibles uses on the order of 100–200 kg/yr each.  Total non-hydrogen demand in allied countries is expected to remain well under 1 t/yr.
- **Total Allied Demand by 2030:** Roughly 3–6 tonnes/year, overwhelmingly driven (>80%) by PEM hydrogen systems.  (This range depends on technology (thrifting) and deployment rate assumptions ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%20thrifting%20and%20design%20efficiency,to%2030%20kg%2FGW%20by%202050)).)

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 0.5–1.5 tons/year*

- **Mining (Domestic):** Essentially zero.  No primary Ir mines are planned in the US or allied countries.  Existing platinum/nickel mining districts (e.g. Sudbury, Stillwater, Western Australia) will continue to produce only minuscule by-product Ir (on the order of tens of kg).  Thus virtually all Ir for US/allies must originate from foreign sources.
- **Recycling (Secondary):** Growing contribution.  The DOE hydrogen strategy and industry recycling initiatives aim for very high PGM recovery from end-of-life devices.  Spent PEM stacks (7–10 year lifetimes) will begin to return to refineries by the early 2030s.  For example, analyses show that closed-loop recovery of just 10% of Ir from spent spark plugs and industrial uses (on a ~10-year delay) could supply ~100–200 kg/yr and help cover shortfalls ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=electrolyser%E2%80%99s%20have%20a%207,Nevertheless%2C%20evaluating%20cumulative)).  Factoring EU-Japan-US electrolyser roll-outs, JP/US/EU war-chest plans envision recycling rates >95–99% of Ir within PEM systems by 2030 ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=The%20US%E2%80%99s%20clean%20hydrogen%20roadmap,Nevertheless%2C%20evaluating%20cumulative)).  Optimistically, robust cathode recycling might supply several hundred kilograms to over a ton of Ir annually by 2030, depending on installed capacity.
- **Imports (External):** All Ir needed beyond recycling must be imported.  Major producers remain South Africa (Bushveld Complex, ~85% of mine Ir) and Zimbabwe (~8%), with Russia (Norilsk) ~5% ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)), and minor amounts from others (North America, India).  U.S./allied net import reliance for Ir is thus extremely high (>95%) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)).  

## References for volumes

**Global production:** Industry sources indicate roughly 190,000 troy ounces (≈5.9 t) of Iridium were mined globally in 2022, mostly as a by-product of platinum mining ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,iridium%2C%20consuming%20total%20annual%20supply)) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)).  Including recycled Iridium, total annual global supply is ≈250,000 oz (7.8 t) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,iridium%2C%20consuming%20total%20annual%20supply)).  South Africa and Zimbabwe dominate primary output (together ~93–95%), with Russia supplying most of the remainder ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)).  
**US production:**  USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries shows no separate US Iridium production (only Pt/Pd output reported) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)).  US Ir imports in 2022 were on the order of 2–3 tonnes (nearly all unwrought Ir) – consistent with trade data showing the US is >90% dependent on foreign Ir ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=Iridium%E2%80%99s%20annual%20supply%20of%20,iridium%2C%20consuming%20total%20annual%20supply)).  
**Canada production:**  Natural Resources Canada reports ~702,000 oz of combined PGMs in 2023 (primarily Pd/Pt from Lac des Îles) and does not list Iridium separately.  By analogy, Canadian Ir output is tiny – estimated <0.5 t/yr as an unavoidable by-product ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=The%20iridium%20market%20is%20very,as%20long%20as%20platinum%20is)).  
**Demand forecast:**  Hydrogen Council/IEA scenarios project on the order of 80–100 GW of PEM electrolyser capacity globally by 2030.  At 400 kg Ir/GW today, cumulative 2030 demand would be ~32–40 t; thrifting to 80 kg/GW cuts that to ~6.4–8 t ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=of%20iridium%20use%20will%20not,mined%20each%20year%2C%20never%20mind)) ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)).  WPIC and JM show that combined thrifting/substitution/recycling can meet demand out to 2050, but that achieves this only if US/allied supply (imports + recycling) grows to a few tonnes per year by 2030 ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=iridium%20requirements%20over%20three%20ten,annum%20by%20the%20early%202030s)).  
**Supply forecast:** Johnson Matthey and WPIC analyses agree that with aggressive catalyst thrifting (≲80 kg/GW by 2030) and very high (>95%) end-of-life recycling, cumulative Ir requirements for PEM electrolysers can be met through 2050 without new mining ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=iridium%20requirements%20over%20three%20ten,annum%20by%20the%20early%202030s)).  Nonetheless, this implies US/allied Ir supply chains must deliver several tonnes per year by 2030 (largely via imported primary material and recycled recovery) to keep pace with electrolyser growth.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Airborne geophysics for mafic intrusions; IP/EM for sulfides; hyperspectral for alteration; stream sediment PGE assays*

- **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Exploration begins with targeting known PGM host terrains – typically layered mafic–ultramafic intrusions (like the Bushveld or Lac des Îles complex ([cdnsciencepub.com](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/e89-120#:~:text=The%20Lac%20des%20Iles%20Complex,Distinct%20magma))), komatiite-derived sulfides, or Archean greenstone belts.  Detailed field mapping identifies rock units (e.g. chromitite layers, pyroxenite zones) and structures.  Systematic sampling of soils, rocks and glacial tills for PGE tracer metals (Pd, Pt, Rh, Os) and associated elements (Ni, Cu, Cr) is standard procedure.  Geochem anomalies in heavy mineral or soil samples help vector toward buried sulfide layers ([cdnsciencepub.com](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/e89-120#:~:text=The%20Lac%20des%20Iles%20Complex,Distinct%20magma)).  
- **Geophysical Surveys:** Airborne magnetics and gravity surveys outline mafic-ultramafic intrusions (high magnetic/density signature).  Once a prospective intrusion is located, more targeted surveys (ground magnetics, gravity) refine it.  To locate PGM-bearing sulfides, induced-polarization (IP) surveys detect disseminated sulfides (high chargeability), while electromagnetic (EM) methods detect conductive bodies (massive sulfides).  For example, Group Ten Metals (Stillwater West, MT) and other explorers routinely report using airborne EM and IP to define conductive, high-chargeability zones that could host Ni–Cu–PGE mineralization ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223852168_A_review_of_the_PGM_industry_deposit_models_and_exploration_practices_Implications_for_Australia%27s_PGM_potential#:~:text=PGM%20mineralisation%20in%20layered%20intrusions,Since%202001%20RIM%20has)).  Similarly, Fortescue and Karora in Australia use large IP surveys over ultramafic belts to target Ni–Cu–PGE systems.  
- **Remote Sensing:** Satellite and airborne hyperspectral imaging can map alteration and lithology over large areas.  Sensors (ASTER, HyMap, etc.) can detect serpentine, talc, olivine, chromite signatures associated with altered ultramafics, and highlight structural lineaments or xenolith assemblages.  For instance, hyperspectral couples have been used to outline alteration haloes (serpentinite, talc-carbonate) around known PGM deposits ([cdnsciencepub.com](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/e89-120#:~:text=The%20Lac%20des%20Iles%20Complex,Distinct%20magma)).  
- **Heavy-Mineral Sampling:** Stream- or soil-sediment sampling concentrates PGM-bearing minerals (e.g. chromite, sperrylite, PtAs2).  Tills in glaciated Precambrian shields are sampled using regional heavy-mineral pan or till sampling, with lab assays for ultratrace Pt/Pd/Ir.  This approach has been productive in Scandinavia and Canada for PGE pathfinders.  
- **Data-driven Prospecting:** Modern techniques increasingly use GIS and data science to integrate geology, geophysics and geochemistry.  Statistical and machine-learning prospectivity models can identify overlooked PGE targets by pattern recognition (for example, training on the Bushveld or Noril’sk analogue).  Geoscience Australia’s Knowledge Node and similar initiatives demonstrate using spatial data libraries and algorithms to rank prospective ultramafic belts for PGM exploration.  

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Flotation concentration; smelting to matte; pressure oxidation; chlorination leaching; electrorefining*

- **Ore Concentration (Flotation):** Mill and float PGM-base metal ores (typically Ni–Cu–Fe sulfides).  Ore is crushed and ground, then froth-flotation concentrates the sulfides.  Xanthate or thionocarbamate collectors and frothers yield a bulk sulfide concentrate (generally 5–20% Ni+Cu, with PGMs locked in the sulfides) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54/htm#:~:text=comminution%20followed%20by%20flotation%20and,extensively%20reviewed%20in%20numerous%20publications)).  Typical PGM sink in these concentrates is hundreds of grams per tonne (e.g. 100–500 g/t total PGE in Bushveld-type concentrates ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54/htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L345%20gravity%E2%80%93flotation%20concentration,on%20the%20type%20of%20ores))).  
- **Sulfide Smelting & Converting:** Sulfide concentrates are smelted (flash or electric furnace) to a Ni–Cu–Fe matte (25–40% Ni/Cu). PGMs and precious-metal elements partition mainly into the matte phase.  Converting (blowing with O₂) oxidizes Fe and S to slag and gas, leaving a Cu–Ni–PGE-rich converter matte.  For example, Norilsk/Talnakh and Stillwater operation mattes contain >1,000 g/t combined PGEs after converting.  
- **Pressure Oxidation (Autoclave):** Mattes or sulfide concentrates can undergo pressure oxidation in autoclaves (150–210°C, 8–12 bar O₂).  Base metal sulfides (Ni, Cu, Co) oxidize to soluble sulphates, while most PGMs remain insoluble residue ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54/htm#:~:text=comminution%20followed%20by%20flotation%20and,extensively%20reviewed%20in%20numerous%20publications)).  Alternatively, atmospheric chlorination (HCl + Cl₂) can dissolve base metal sulfides (and some Os), liberating PGM-rich solids.   
- **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** The PGE-bearing residue (e.g. converted matte or leach residue) is treated with oxidative chloride solutions.  Chlorine gas in HCl or “dry” chlorination converts PGMs (especially Pt, Pd, Ir) to soluble chlorocomplexes. Aqua regia (3:1 HCl–HNO₃) at 80–90°C will dissolve Pt/Pd and most Ir (though Ir often requires prolonged treatment or repeated steps).  These produce a crude PGE-bearing solution for further separation.  
- **Electrorefining:** Solutions from chloride leaching can be processed by metal electrowinning.  For example, Pt and Pd can be electroplated onto cathodes by controlled potential in chloride media, leaving Ir/Ru in solution.  This step provides bulk separation: Iridium typically remains as soluble [IrCl₆]²⁻, while Pt/Pd deposit out ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54/htm#:~:text=comminution%20followed%20by%20flotation%20and,extensively%20reviewed%20in%20numerous%20publications)).  (Commercial flowsheets often alternate chemical and electrolytic steps to purify each PGM product.)

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Selective precipitation as (NH₄)₂IrCl₆; solvent extraction with amines/ILs; anion exchange; OsO₄ distillation*

- **Selective Precipitation:** In strong HCl, Ir(IV) forms the hexachloroiridate complex [IrCl₆]²⁻.  Adding excess NH₄Cl precipitates ammonium hexachloroiridate, (NH₄)₂[IrCl₆], which can be filtered out ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586621005268?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8e8cd0e46a7d3b83#:~:text=and%20rhodium%28III%29%20have%20been%20investigated,mathematical%20model%20has%20been%20developed)).  The solid is then calcined to IrO₂ and hydrogen-reduced at ~800–1000°C to metallic Ir powder.  This classic route yields >99% pure Ir metal given efficient chemistry.  
- **Solvent Extraction:** Liquid–liquid extraction with quaternary ammonium salts or amine-based ionic liquids selectively separates IrCl₆²⁻.  For instance, hydrophobic ionic-liquid extractants (e.g. tetraalkylammonium chlorides) efficiently recover Ir(IV) from 6–8 M HCl, leaving Pt/Pd behind ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586621005268?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8e8cd0e46a7d3b83#:~:text=and%20rhodium%28III%29%20have%20been%20investigated,mathematical%20model%20has%20been%20developed)).  Stripping with dilute acid or ammonia back-extracts Ir.  (Recent research shows deep-eutectic or ionic-liquid systems achieving high Ir/Rh separation factors ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586621005268?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8e8cd0e46a7d3b83#:~:text=and%20rhodium%28III%29%20have%20been%20investigated,mathematical%20model%20has%20been%20developed)).)  
- **Ion Exchange:** Strong-base anion-exchange resins (Cl⁻ form) adsorb [IrCl₆]²⁻ from moderate HCl.  By altering HCl concentration, other PGM complexes elute first, allowing Ir to be eluted second.  Properly designed resin processes can capture >99% of Ir from chloride solutions with high purity (resins are regenerated and recycled).  
- **Osmium Removal:** Osmium impurities are oxidized (e.g. roasting residue at 600–800°C) to volatile osmium tetroxide (OsO₄).  OsO₄ is scrubbed in cold caustic or NaOH solution to osmium oxide, removing it from the Ir-rich residue.  This ensures Os (a radioactive hazard) is eliminated before final Ir recovery.  
- **Crystallization:** For ultimate purity (>99.99%), the Ir solution (as IrCl₆²⁻) may undergo repeated recrystallization of (NH₄)₂[IrCl₆] from hot HCl.  Multiple recrystallizations remove trace impurities; the final oxide is reduced to obtain ultra-high-purity Ir for electronics/fine wire.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Arc melting at 2450°C; e-beam melting; zone refining; powder metallurgy; spark-plasma sintering*

- **High-Temperature Melting:** Iridium’s melting point (≈2447°C) requires specialized systems.  Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) or electron-beam melting in water-cooled copper crucibles are used.  These scrap-remelting processes (e.g. 2–3 passes) remove volatile impurities and yield >99.9% Ir ingots.  
- **Zone Refining:** For semiconductor/electronics-grade Ir (≥99.99%), zone refining is applied. An induction coil melts a localized zone in a rod; impurities segregate to one end as the zone is passed repeatedly.  Multiple passes can reduce trace impurities to <1 ppb.  
- **Powder Metallurgy:** Chemical Ir powder can be consolidated without melting.  Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) compacts Ir powder at ~1500–1800°C and ~100–200 MPa in inert gas, producing fully dense bar or billet.  This preserves ultrafine grain structure.  
- **Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS):** SPS (field-assisted sintering) rapidly heats and densifies Ir powder by pulsed DC current under pressure.  Temperatures ~1400–1600°C suffice (due to Joule heating), yielding dense parts faster than conventional sintering and limiting grain growth.  SPS is useful for specialty shapes and nanograined Ir alloys.  
- **Alloying/Forming:** Pure Ir is brittle, so small alloy additions improve workability.  Ir–W or Ir–Rh alloys (3–10% W/Rh) are cast or clad.  Hot forging (~1200–1500°C) and warm rolling sheet or wire produces desired forms.  Final anneals (≈1000–1200°C) relieve stresses and control crystallographic texture.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Lime neutralization of acids; SO₂ scrubbing to H₂SO₄; closed-loop PGM recovery; membrane filtration; zero liquid discharge*

- **Effluent Neutralization:** Acidic waste streams (pH 0–2, containing dissolved HCl/HNO₃ and metal ions) are neutralized with lime (CaO) or limestone (CaCO₃) to pH ~6–9.  Metals (Fe, Cu, Ni, etc.) precipitate as hydroxides/oxides.  The resulting sludge is filtered. Proper control can reduce dissolved PGM content in effluent to below detectable levels (<<1 ppm) because nearly all PGMs go into sludge or recoverable solids.  
- **Gas Scrubbing:** Smelting and leaching off-gases (SO₂, Cl₂, HF, NOₓ) are treated in wet scrubbers.  SO₂ is absorbed in limestone or NaOH to yield sulfite/sulfate (waste gypsum or Na₂SO₄).  Any chlorine fumes are scrubbed in caustic to form hypochlorite.  State-of-the-art plants achieve >99% removal of SO₂ and other acidic gases from the gas stream.  
- **Solvent Recovery:** Organics (e.g. PGM extractants) are recycled by distillation or chemical stripping.  Spent amine or solvent is regenerated: it is washed with acid or base to remove salts, then evaporated/recycled.  Additives like activated carbon or clay remove decomposition products.  Modern solvent recovery can exceed 95% yield, minimizing organic waste.  
- **Particulate Control:** Flue gases from furnaces and roasters pass through baghouse filters or electrostatic precipitators; these capture >99.9% of dust including PGM-bearing particles.  Even minute PGM dusts are recovered and returned to the process.  High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) units on refinery ventilation prevent worker exposure or environmental release of any Ir‐bearing dust.  
- **Closed-Loop Recovery:** PGM‐rich wastes (spent catalysts, filter cakes, resin brines) are continuously recycled to the refinery feed circuit.  For example, spent PEM electrolyzer MEAs or exhausted industrial catalysts are processed to recover PGMs.  Integrated operations report overall Ir recovery efficiencies above 98% when such closed‐loop recycling is practiced.  Similarly, DOE aims for ~95% Ir recovery from end-of-life electrolyzer materials.  The goal is effectively zero PGM loss from the system (“zero liquid discharge” for PGMs).

## References for mining technologies

Major advances in PGE exploration have employed modern integrated techniques.  For example, Group Ten Metals (Stillwater West, MT) recently reported the use of airborne EM and IP surveys coupled with soil geochemistry to delineate a 9+ km chargeability anomaly in the intrusion (analogous to Bushveld reefs) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/223852168_A_review_of_the_PGM_industry_deposit_models_and_exploration_practices_Implications_for_Australia%27s_PGM_potential#:~:text=PGM%20mineralisation%20in%20layered%20intrusions,Since%202001%20RIM%20has)).  Geologists focus on mapping layered intrusions and komatiitic sills (as in Lac des Îles ([cdnsciencepub.com](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/e89-120#:~:text=The%20Lac%20des%20Iles%20Complex,Distinct%20magma))), sampling for Ni–Cu–PGE sulfide indicator elements.  Well-known deposit compilations (e.g. USGS PGM reviews) document classic Bushveld/Stillwater/Noril’sk models, which guide prospecting worldwide.  Bulk sampling and heavy mineral analyses in glacial tills or stream sediments are proven in shield terrains.  Simulation tools and ML-driven geoscience (data from IEA, DOE, Minerals Councils, etc.) are now used to prioritize targets.

Morrison, 2021; Du Plessis, 2018; and others have detailed autoclave and roasting routes for PGMs.  For example, pressure oxidation at 180°C is standard to oxidize matte, leaving PGMs insoluble ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54/htm#:~:text=comminution%20followed%20by%20flotation%20and,extensively%20reviewed%20in%20numerous%20publications)).  Hydrometallurgy references (Marsh & Dolley, 2002) describe chloride leaching of Pt/Pd and Ir, with solvent extraction ion-exchange schemes to separate Ir ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586621005268?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8e8cd0e46a7d3b83#:~:text=and%20rhodium%28III%29%20have%20been%20investigated,mathematical%20model%20has%20been%20developed)).  IPMI technical guides cover the sequential separation: most flowsheets precipitate (NH₄)₂IrCl₆, then reduce it to metal ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383586621005268?fr=RR-12&ref=pdf_download&rr=8e8cd0e46a7d3b83#:~:text=and%20rhodium%28III%29%20have%20been%20investigated,mathematical%20model%20has%20been%20developed)).  Finally, advanced refining (IPMI, 2010) describes arc or E-beam melting of Ir, followed by zone refining to >99.99% purity.

These processes are supported by environmental controls detailed in technical literature (e.g. EPA Metallurgical Waste guidelines).  For instance, standard practice is to neutralize spent acidic waste to neutral pH with lime, precipitating metal hydroxides.  Flue-gas scrubbers with limestone remove SO₂ (>99%), and hazardous volatiles (Cl₂, NOₓ) are quenched in caustic.  Industry reviews (HSMEnviro 2020) note inerting of pyroprocesses and solvent recycling protocols that limit effluent volume (often achieving zero PGM bleed).  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)

No new Iridium mine is expected in the US or allied countries, so supply is fixed by existing by-product sources.  The only way to meet rising PEM electrolyzer demand is through dramatic catalyst “thrifting” (target ≲80 kg Ir/GW by 2030) and near-complete recycled recovery of spent catalysts ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/science-and-innovation/expert-insights/2022/recycling-and-thrifting-the-answer-to-the-iridium-question-in-electrolyser-growth#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20make%20the,20%25%20of%20supply)) ([platinuminvestment.com](https://platinuminvestment.com/investment-research/perspectives/iridium-availability-is-not-a-bottleneck-to-pem-electrolyser-ramp-up-platinum-demand-from-pem-electrolysers-could-reach-500-koz-pa-within-10-years#:~:text=iridium%20requirements%20over%20three%20ten,annum%20by%20the%20early%202030s)).  Industry analyses concur that unless Ir loadings fall and recycling efficiencies exceed ~95%, a severe Iridium shortage could bottleneck the hydrogen economy.
