## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Catalyst thrifting to <80 kg/GW; 95%+ recycling efficiency; membrane electrode assembly recovery*

The single greatest bottleneck is **catalyst efficiency and recycling**, not mining. Since no new Western iridium mines are forthcoming, US/allied supply hinges on reducing per-unit Ir demand and recapturing spent material. Johnson Matthey emphasizes that Ir loadings in PEM electrolysers must plunge from current ~400 kg/GW to ~80 kg/GW by 2030 to keep demand within supply constraints. Likewise, achieving >95% recycling of iridium catalysts from spent membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) is essential. Without breakthroughs in catalyst design and recovery processes, Ir shortage will bottleneck the allied hydrogen transition and related technologies.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: <0.1 tons/year*

• **United States:** Effectively zero. The Stillwater Mine (Montana, Sibanye-Stillwater) produces primarily Pd/Pt; USGS reports no separate Ir output. US Ir imports in 2022 were 2,310 kg according to USGS data, with domestic production remaining negligible.

• **Canada:** Minimal byproduct output (<0.5 t estimated) from Ontario PGM and Ni/Cu mines. Lac des Iles (Ontario) is Canada's only dedicated PGM mine (mainly Pd/Pt); Ir is recovered only in trace amounts as an unavoidable byproduct.

• **Australia/EU/Norway/Iceland/Japan:** No active Ir production. Australia mines nickel/Cu but recovers negligible Ir; Europe and Japan import all needs. Allied total production is essentially nil. For context, global primary mine production of Ir was approximately 190,000 oz (~5.9 t) in 2022, with total supply including recycling reaching ~250,000 oz (~7.8 t).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 3-6 tons/year*

• **Hydrogen PEM Electrolysis:** The dominant driver. Industrial plans in the US, EU, Japan and Australia target tens of GW of PEM capacity by 2030. If US/EU/Japan achieve 20 GW combined by 2030, this would require ~8 t total at current 400 kg/GW loadings. With catalyst "thrifting" targeting 80 kg/GW by 2030, this falls to ~1.6 t. Annual demand for new capacity additions could reach 2-4 t/yr by 2030.

• **Automotive/Industrial (Spark Plugs, Catalysts):** Current Ir uses include spark-plug electrodes and chemical catalysts. These are modest compared to hydrogen. WPIC notes that Ir substitution in spark plugs could free up 45-67 koz (1.4-2.1 t) globally by 2030, partly offsetting demand. Allied automotive/industrial demand is estimated at 0.5-1 t/yr by 2030 (declining as EVs rise).

• **Other Uses (Electronics, Glass, Crucibles):** Each sector uses <0.2 t annually. Iridium crucibles for crystal growth, electrical contacts and specialty catalysts will add only a few hundred kg/year. Overall US/allied demand for 2030 is estimated at **3-6 tonnes** per year (dominated by PEM hydrogen).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 0.5-1.5 tons/year*

• **Mining (Domestic):** Essentially zero. No new iridium mines are planned in US or allied countries. Existing nickel and platinum operations (e.g., Sudbury, Stillwater) will produce Ir only as an unavoidable trace byproduct at current negligible levels.

• **Recycling (Secondary):** Growing contributor. The US DOE's hydrogen initiatives target high PGM recovery rates from electrolyser catalysts. Spent PEM MEAs (7-10 year life) will begin re-entering the supply chain around 2030. WPIC estimates that recovering even 10% of existing non-PEM Ir applications could help meet future shortfalls. By 2030, closed-loop recycling might supply 0.5-1.5 t/yr of Ir to US/allies, partially offsetting imports.

• **Imports/External:** All other supply must come from foreign mines (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Russia). With domestic mine output essentially zero, US/allies remain >95% import-reliant for iridium. USGS data show net import reliance >60% for Pt/Pd; for Ir it exceeds 95%.

## References for volumes

• **Global production:** USGS/WPIC data show ~190,000 troy oz primary mine production and ~250,000 oz total supply including recycling in 2022. South Africa dominated with ~85% of primary production; Zimbabwe ~8%, Russia ~5%, others ~2%.

• **US production:** USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries 2023 lists Pd/Pt mine output (~14.3 t Pd, 3.3 t Pt) but no Ir, while Ir imports were 2,310 kg in 2022. US domestic Ir mine output is therefore ~0.

• **Canadian production:** Natural Resources Canada reports Canada's 2023 PGM mine output at 702,000 oz (primarily Pd/Pt). Iridium production is not separately reported but estimated at <500 kg annually as byproduct.

• **Demand forecast:** IEA/Hydrogen Council scenarios projecting 80-100 GW global PEM capacity by 2030 would require ~32-40 t Ir cumulative at current loadings. With thrifting to 80 kg/GW, cumulative demand drops to 6.4-8 t. Annual allied demand could reach 3-6 t/yr by 2030.

• **Supply forecast:** Johnson Matthey and WPIC analyses show that with aggressive recycling (>95%) and thrifting (<80 kg/GW), cumulative PEM Ir demand can be met through 2050. This requires allied supply chain development of 3-6 t/yr by 2030, mostly via imports and recycling.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Airborne geophysics for mafic intrusions; IP/EM for sulfides; hyperspectral for alteration; stream sediment PGE assays*

• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Target known PGM host rocks (layered mafic-ultramafic intrusions, komatiites, Archean greenstone belts). Detailed field mapping identifies nickel-copper-PGE sulfide layers or chromitite horizons. Geochemical sampling of soils, rocks and glacial tills for PGE tracers (Pd, Pt, Rh, Os) highlights anomalies. Canada's Lac des Iles deposit (Ontario) occurs in an Archean mafic-ultramafic complex.

• **Geophysical Surveys:** Airborne and ground methods detect PGE-bearing bodies. Magnetic surveys identify mafic intrusions; gravity surveys detect dense ultramafic bodies. Modern explorers use induced-polarization (IP) and electromagnetic (EM) surveys: IP detects disseminated sulfides (high chargeability), EM finds massive sulfide conductors. At Montana's Stillwater West, Group Ten Metals used large-scale IP/airborne EM surveys to define high-chargeability/conductivity zones associated with Pd-Pt mineralization.

• **Remote Sensing:** Hyperspectral satellite or drone imagery maps alteration minerals (serpentine, talc, chromite) that typically accompany ultramafic intrusions. Structural lineaments and geochemical halos are identified via multi-spectral analysis.

• **Heavy-Mineral Sampling:** Stream sediment and till sampling can concentrate PGE-bearing minerals (chromite, sperrylite, cooperite). Specialized laboratory analysis including automated mineralogy helps trace buried deposits. These techniques are particularly useful in glaciated terrains.

• **Data-Driven Prospecting:** Machine-learning prospectivity mapping integrating geology, geochemistry, and geophysics can highlight overlooked PGE targets. Analogues from known districts (Bushveld, Stillwater, Noril'sk) inform regional exploration models in allied jurisdictions.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Flotation concentration; flash smelting to matte; pressure oxidation; chlorination leaching; electrorefining*

• **Ore Concentration (Flotation):** PGM ores (typically Ni-Cu sulfides) are crushed, ground and subjected to froth flotation. Xanthate collectors and frothers preferentially float sulfide minerals; PGM minerals (sperrylite, cooperite, laurite) report to sulfide concentrates. This yields a concentrate containing 100-500 g/t total PGMs.

• **Sulfide Smelting & Converting:** Concentrates are smelted in flash or electric furnaces to produce matte. Base metals (Ni, Cu, Fe) form a molten sulfide matte, while PGMs collect in this phase. Converting removes iron and sulfur, concentrating PGMs further. Stillwater and Sudbury operations produce Ni-Cu-PGE matte containing >1000 g/t PGMs.

• **Pressure Oxidation:** To liberate PGMs, mattes undergo autoclave leaching at 150-200°C with oxygen. This oxidizes base metal sulfides to sulfates while PGMs remain in residue. Alternatively, atmospheric leaching with chlorine/HCl dissolves base metals, leaving PGM-rich residues.

• **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** PGM residues are dissolved using oxidative chloride leaching. Chlorine gas with HCl, or aqua regia (3:1 HCl:HNO₃) at 80-90°C dissolves PGMs into chloro-complexes. Iridium's resistance requires extended leaching times or repeated treatments.

• **Electrorefining:** In some flowsheets, crude PGM solutions undergo electrowinning. Platinum and palladium plate onto cathodes at controlled potentials, while iridium remains in solution for separate recovery. This achieves initial separation of major PGMs.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Selective precipitation as (NH₄)₂IrCl₆; solvent extraction with amines; ion-exchange on strong-base resins; distillation of OsO₄*

• **Selective Precipitation:** Iridium(IV) in chloride solution forms stable [IrCl₆]²⁻ complexes. Addition of NH₄Cl precipitates ammonium hexachloroiridate, (NH₄)₂[IrCl₆], which is filtered and calcined to IrO₂. The oxide is hydrogen-reduced at 800-1000°C to iridium metal powder.

• **Solvent Extraction:** Liquid-liquid extraction uses tertiary amines or quaternary ammonium salts to selectively extract PGM chloro-complexes. Ir(IV) extracts at high HCl concentrations (6-8 M), allowing separation from Pt and Pd. Stripping with dilute HCl or NH₄OH yields purified Ir solution.

• **Ion Exchange:** Strong-base anion exchange resins in Cl⁻ form absorb [IrCl₆]²⁻ from 1-3 M HCl media. Sequential elution with varying HCl concentrations separates Ir from other PGMs. This achieves >99% Ir recovery with high purity.

• **Osmium Removal:** If osmium is present, mild oxidative roasting (600-800°C) converts it to volatile OsO₄ which is trapped in caustic scrubbers. This leaves iridium in the residue for further processing.

• **Crystallization:** Final purification involves repeated dissolution and crystallization of (NH₄)₂[IrCl₆] from hot HCl solutions, achieving >99.9% purity.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Arc melting at 2450°C; electron-beam melting; zone refining; powder metallurgy; spark-plasma sintering*

• **High-Temperature Melting:** Iridium's melting point (2447°C) requires specialized equipment. Electron-beam or arc melting in water-cooled copper crucibles under inert atmosphere produces ingots. Vacuum arc remelting removes volatile impurities, achieving >99.95% purity.

• **Zone Refining:** A molten zone passes through an iridium rod via induction heating. Impurities concentrate at one end through repeated passes. This achieves >99.99% purity for electronics applications.

• **Powder Metallurgy:** Iridium powder from chemical reduction is consolidated by hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1500-1800°C and 100-200 MPa. This produces near-theoretical density without melting, preserving fine microstructure.

• **Spark Plasma Sintering:** Pulsed DC current simultaneously heats and compresses Ir powder, achieving rapid densification at lower temperatures (1400-1600°C) than conventional sintering. This minimizes grain growth and contamination.

• **Alloying/Forming:** Pure Ir is alloyed with 3-10% W, Rh, or Ru for improved workability. Hot forging at 1200-1500°C followed by warm rolling produces sheet and wire. Annealing at 1000-1200°C relieves stress and controls grain structure.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Lime neutralization of acids; SO₂ scrubbing to H₂SO₄; closed-loop PGM recovery; membrane filtration; zero liquid discharge*

• **Effluent Neutralization:** Acidic process streams (pH 0-2) containing HCl, HNO₃, and dissolved metals are neutralized with limestone (CaCO₃) or lime (Ca(OH)₂) to pH 6-9. Metal hydroxides precipitate and are filtered, with sludge containing <1 ppm dissolved PGMs.

• **Gas Scrubbing:** SO₂ from smelting is captured in packed towers with NaOH or Ca(OH)₂ solution, producing sulfite/sulfate salts. Modern plants achieve >99% SO₂ removal. Chlorine gas from leaching is scrubbed with caustic to form hypochlorite.

• **Solvent Recovery:** Spent organic extractants are regenerated by distillation under vacuum. Degradation products are removed by clay treatment or activated carbon. This achieves >95% solvent recovery, minimizing waste generation.

• **Particulate Control:** Baghouse filters and electrostatic precipitators capture >99.9% of particulates from furnace off-gases. HEPA filtration in refinery areas prevents release of Ir-bearing dusts. Captured material is recycled to the process.

• **Closed-Loop Recovery:** All Ir-bearing residues, including spent catalysts, filter cakes, and ion-exchange resins, are returned to the refinery circuit. Modern operations achieve >98% overall Ir recovery. Membrane electrode assemblies from PEM electrolysers are designed for >95% Ir recovery at end-of-life.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)

U.S. and allied iridium production is constrained by geology; essentially no economically viable ore deposits exist for primary mining. Supply growth depends entirely on technology that reduces consumption and maximizes recycling. Achieving Ir loadings below 80 kg/GW in PEM electrolysers and >95% recycling efficiency of spent catalysts are the critical technological requirements. Without these breakthroughs in catalyst design and recovery processes, iridium scarcity will severely limit the allied hydrogen economy transition.
