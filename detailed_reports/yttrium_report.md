## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:**  MP Materials’ Mountain Pass mine (California) is currently the sole large-scale REE operation.  In 2023 MP Materials produced ~41,557 tonnes of rare-earth oxides (REO) in concentrate ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=Full%20Year%202023%20Highlights)), which includes Yttrium as part of the mix.  (If one assumes Yttrium oxide is a few percent of that output, US Y₂O₃ production is on the order of 1–2 × 10³ t/yr.)  No other U.S. mine produces Yttrium at scale; companies are developing smaller byproduct streams (e.g. monazite from heavy-mineral operations) but output is negligible.  
• **Australia:**  Lynas Corp’s Mt Weld mine (WA) is the only major REE producer outside China.  Lynas reported ~10,908 t of REO output in FY2024 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)).  This concentrates light and some heavy REEs (including Yttrium).  No pure-Yttrium mine exists; Yttrium derives from the mixed bastnäsite/monazite ore.  Other projects (e.g. Hastings’ Yangibana, not yet in production) may add REE (and Y) supply in future.  
• **Canada:**  Currently **zero** domestic Yttrium production.  Canada’s Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) has built a rare-earth processing hub (Saskatoon) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/52990ac7-6ba6-4c1d-aa52-ae265695ca30#:~:text=Saskatchewan%2C%20to%20counter%20China%27s%20control,scale%20Canadian%20mining%20operations)), but it processes imported ores, not domestic mine output. Cabinet-funded projects (e.g. Prairie projects) are years from production, so domestic output in 2023 was essentially nil.  
• **European Union:**  Essentially **zero** Yttrium mining production.  No active REE mines exist in the EU; planned mines (e.g. Sweden’s Per Geijer) are mid‐development.  European producers like Solvay (La Rochelle, France) focus on separation/refining, not mining ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20bloc%20is%20expected,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by)).  The bloc relies almost entirely on imports of Y-REE concentrates (primarily from China), though it is investing to retrofit ~45% of its REE separation capacity by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20set%20ambitious,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by)).  
• **Norway:**  No current production.  The planned REEtec (Norway) heavy-REE plant (est. 2,000 t/yr) is not online until ~2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-rare-earths-supply-chain-springs-into-gear-2024-06-17/#:~:text=Carolina.%20,to%20start%20production%20in%202025)), so as of today Norway produces essentially no Yttrium metal or oxide domestically.  
• **Japan:**  **Zero** domestic Yttrium mine or refinery; Japan imports ~100% of its YRE-materials (as with all REEs) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-rare-earths-supply-chain-springs-into-gear-2024-06-17/#:~:text=,in%20Estonia%20by%20next%20year)).  The country is actively diversifying suppliers (outsourcing to US/AUS projects, etc.), but in 2023 all Yttrium used in Japan came via import.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Steady Growth:**  Yttrium demand underpins many technologies (phosphors, YAG lasers, ceramics, SOFC electrolytes, electronics).  Although precise forecasts for Y are scarce, industry analyses project a strong rise in all REE demands by 2030.  For example, the IEA projects a ~40% increase in overall rare-earth metal demand by 2030 ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rare-earth-elements-2025-strategic-importance/#:~:text=Looking%20ahead%2C%20demand%20projections%20are,earth%20breakthrough%20to%20meet%20future)).  If Yttrium follows suit, US and allied consumption of Y₂O₃ could similarly jump by ~40%.  
• **US Demand:**  Historically modest – roughly on the order of 800–1,000 t/yr of Y₂O₃ in recent years ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/802829/us-yttrium-consumption/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20estimated%20consumption,ceramics%2C%20electronics%2C%20lasers%2C%20and%20metallurgy)).  Major uses include high-tech ceramics (e.g. YSZ fuel cells), fiber optics/lasers (YAG), and phosphors.  By 2030, with growth in EV electricity (some Y in LED phosphors), defense lasers, and electronics, US demand might reach on the order of 1,200–1,500 t/yr (projected).  
• **EU & Wood Allies:**  Europe’s baseline Yttrium demand is also in the low- to mid-thousand‐t/yr range today.  Given the EU’s aggressive EV/magnet and energy targets, demand is expected to climb.  Solvay’s expansion to meet 20–30% of EU magnet needs by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=earths%20but%20now%20produces%20a,possibly%20not%20until%20after%202030)) implies Europe will need several thousand tons of REYs (with Y untabulated separately).  Similarly, Japan’s consumption (currently a few hundred t/yr of Y₂O₃) is likely to rise with more EVs and consumer electronics.  Overall, allied (US+CAN+AUS+EU+NO+JP) Y-oxide demand by 2030 is plausibly in the single-digit thousands of tonnes per year (several thousand tons), though exact published forecasts for Y are limited.  
• **Sector Drivers:**  Key growth drivers include EV motors/generators (rare‐earth magnets use Nd/Pr plus Dy/Tb, though Y is not a magnet core element, magnets demand stimulates overall REE industry), energy-efficient lighting and displays (Y-based phosphors), and advanced defense systems (Y-doped lasers).  Allied governments assume much higher critical‐minerals use: e.g. the US Defense Dept. defines Australia/Canada as domestic sources under the DPA ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-track-establish-domestic-rare-earths-supply-chain-defence-official-says-2024-05-22/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20aims%20to,as%20domestic%20sources%20under%20the)), implicitly including Yttrium in that category, anticipating increased demand for clean-tech and defense applications.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **USA:**  Expansion projects aim to raise US ore output.  MP Materials is implementing its “Upstream 60K” plan, targeting nearly 60,000 t/yr of REO (concentrate) by ~2027 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2023-results#:~:text=Third%20Quarter%202023%20Financial%20and,N%2FM)) (up from ~41,600 t in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=Full%20Year%202023%20Highlights))).  This would increase the Yttrium contained in domestic concentrate.  New facilities (e.g. Iluka/Lynas HREE plant in Texas funded by DOD ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-rare-earths-supply-chain-springs-into-gear-2024-06-17/#:~:text=,by%202025%2C%20alongside%20recycling%20initiatives))) will add downstream separation capacity, but full Y₂O₃ production still hinges on finished-processing plants.  If these come online, US-backed rare-earth capacity could approach several ×10⁴ tonnes REO by 2030.  
• **Australia:**  Lynas plans to maintain ~11–15 k t/yr of REO (its target after expansions ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t))).  Iluka Resources is building a ~5,000 t/yr RE refinery (heavy minerals) in WA ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/8105da5b-a901-44dd-bb15-d9a94ae403c0#:~:text=to%20challenge%20China%27s%20dominance%20in,Western%20Australia%20will%20produce%20rare)) (financed by AU$1.6 bn loan), which should be operating by the late 2020s.  Combined, Australia’s supply (mostly light REEs and some heavy REEs containing Y) could reach ~15–20 k t REO/yr by 2030.  
• **Canada:**  The SRC Saskatchewan processing hub (commercial operation ~2024) will produce REO metals (NdPr, etc.) up to ~480 t/yr (40 t/mo target ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/miner-backed-by-canada-province-vows-compete-with-china-rare-earths-2024-09-23/#:~:text=95,sufficient%20for%20500%2C000%20electric%20vehicles))).  However, without domestic mining, Canadian “supply” depends on imports for feed.  If new yttrium-bearing mines (e.g. prospective Ontario/Québec deposits) come online, Canada could add a few hundred t/yr of Y₂O₃ production by 2030.  
• **European Union:**  EU mining output is projected to remain small in 2030.  Only the Swedish Per Geijer deposit (∼1.7 Mt REO resource ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/swedens-lkab-says-it-could-meet-18-europes-rare-earth-needs-with-per-geijer-mine-2025-01-28/#:~:text=early%202030,countries%20for%20these%20essential%20minerals))) and Finland’s projects could materially start by 2030, albeit at low tonnages (<1,000 t/yr Y₂O₃ likely).  However, EU separation capacity is slated to grow.  Solvay and Neo Performance plan to supply up to ~30% of EU magnet demands by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=earths%20but%20now%20produces%20a,possibly%20not%20until%20after%202030)), implying domestic Yttrium separation on the order of a few thousand t/yr (recycling + imported feed).  In summary, EU allied supply by 2030 may cover 20–30% of demand (per EU target ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20set%20ambitious,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by))) but quantities remain limited (several kt/yr REO).  
• **Norway:**  REEtec’s planned heavy-REE plant (~2,000 t/yr) starts ~2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-rare-earths-supply-chain-springs-into-gear-2024-06-17/#:~:text=Carolina.%20,to%20start%20production%20in%202025)), so post-2030 Norway may domestically produce on that order.  Initial volumes of Y (in HREE concentrate) will be small (low hundreds t/yr of Y₂O₃ equivalent).  
• **Japan:**  Still zero domestic production; all supply must be imported or recycled.  Japan pursues overseas projects (e.g. Australian mines, Greenland’s Tanbreez) to meet its 2030 demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Aerial Radiometric & Magnetic Surveys:** Carbonatite and monazite deposits often carry U/Th (radioactive), so airborne gamma-ray spectrometry can flag anomalies. Carbonatites also produce distinctive magnetic/gravity signatures. For instance, many REE carbonatites (e.g. Mt. Weld) were delineated by combined magnetic and radiometric surveys. Integrated geophysical mapping of magnetic, gravity and gamma data is a standard first step ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/7/720#:~:text=integrated%20approaches%20that%20combine%20geophysical,57)).  
• **Geological Mapping & Petrology:** Identifying REE-host rocks (carbonatites, alkaline complexes, monazite-rich pegmatites or heavy-mineral sands) is critical. Outcrop mapping, structural analysis, and recognition of alteration halos (e.g. iron-oxide or clay caps in weathered carbonatites) guide prospecting. Structural controls (faults, dykes) are often mapped to target mineralized bodies. Science reviews emphasize combining geological, geophysical and geochemical data ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/7/720#:~:text=integrated%20approaches%20that%20combine%20geophysical,57)).  
• **Geochemical Sampling:** Systematic soil, stream-silt and rock-chip geochemistry seeks pathfinder anomalies. Since Yttrium co-occurs with other heavy REEs, geochemical analyses targeting total HREE (including Y) or proxies (e.g. Zr, Nb) can highlight mineralization. Anomalous Y, Ce, or total rare-earth plus concurrent Th/U in soils can pinpoint sources. Geochemical vector mapping (e.g. of Mn-oxides or clays in laterites) often reveals buried REE zones ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/7/720#:~:text=integrated%20approaches%20that%20combine%20geophysical,57)).  
• **Hyperspectral & Remote Sensing:** Satellites or UAVs with hyperspectral cameras detect spectral absorption features of REE minerals (some REEs show characteristic narrow-band signatures). Hyperspectral surveys can delineate carbonate alteration patterns or oxide minerals associated with REE deposits. Modern exploration even applies machine learning to multi-source remote data for target prediction ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/7/720#:~:text=integrated%20approaches%20that%20combine%20geophysical,57)).  
• **Drilling & Downhole Geophysics:** Once targets are defined, core drilling confirms mineralization.  Downhole gamma probes can detect Th-bearing mineral zones. Core logging includes mineralogy (e.g. identifying bastnäsite, xenotime, monazite) and pulps are assayed for yttrium and other REEs to quantify ore.  
• **Data Integration & AI:** Geographic Information Systems (GIS) synthesize geophysical, geochemical and geological data. Recent work leverages ML algorithms (Random Forest, SVM) on regional datasets to rank REE prospectivity ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/7/720#:~:text=integrated%20approaches%20that%20combine%20geophysical,57)). This cross-disciplinary approach is now recognized as critical for discovering complex REE ore systems.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit and Dredge Mining:** Most REE extraction in allied mines is via conventional earth-moving.  Carbonatite deposits (Mountain Pass, Mt. Weld) are open-pit; heavy-mineral sands are dredged or trucked (as in Iluka’s Eneabba project). Stripping covers and blasting expose ore.  
• **Crushing & Grinding:** Run‐of‐mine ore is crushed in stages (jaw, cone, SAG mills) to liberate REE minerals from the gangue. Grinding circuits reduce rocks to sand/fine sizes (~100–200 µm) for further separation. Primary crush and ball mills are standard.  
• **Dense Media Separation (DMS):** Crushed ore (especially mineral sands) is fed to heavy‐media cyclones or jigs where ferrosilicon or magnetite slurry separates high‐density minerals.  Monazite (Y‐bearing), ilmenite, zircon, xenotime etc. are concentrated by their higher specific gravity compared to quartz. This first stage enriches REE‐bearing minerals before fine separation.  
• **Spiral & Shaking Table Concentration:** Further density separation uses spiral concentrators or shaker tables. These separate mineral sands by fluid dynamics: for example, Eramet’s work on Senegal HMS showed that 1.5 T magnetic separation plus gravity shaking-table achieved ~95% monazite recovery ([www.scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=113030#:~:text=Magnetic%20and%20gravity%20separation%20tests,and%20a%20titanium%20oxide%20concentrate)) (monazite is paramagnetic and heavy). Such circuits yield a high-grade REE concentrate from the DMS feed.  
• **Magnetic & Electrostatic Separation:** Following gravity/DMS, magnetic separators (induced‐roll or reverberatory magnets) and electrostatic units further split mineral fractions.  Ilmenite/hematite (strong magnetic) are removed first; zircon versus monazite can be separated by intermediate magnets (monazite is weakly magnetic). Electrostatic separators exploit conductivity differences (e.g. rutile vs ilmenite). Combined, these recover >94% of monazite from heavy-ore streams ([www.scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=113030#:~:text=Magnetic%20and%20gravity%20separation%20tests,and%20a%20titanium%20oxide%20concentrate)).  
• **Froth Flotation:** The concentrated heavy‐mineral fines (esp. silica‐rich rejects) are treated by flotation to produce a REE‐rich final concentrate.  Collectors (fatty acids, e.g. oleate) preferentially float phosphate minerals like monazite.  Bench-scale tests show oleic-acid flotation of monazite yielding ~18% TREO in concentrate at ~89% recovery ([www.cell.com](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440%2823%2906805-6#:~:text=Froth%20Flotation%20%20,%E2%80%93)) (from an ~0.9 wt% TREO feed). In practice, multi-stage flotation (often with pH adjustment) is used to remove silicic gangue and upgrade REE content.  
• **Leaching (Acid/Base):** For some ores (monazite/phosphate), chemical leaching is key.  Traditionally, monazite concentrate is roasted with H₂SO₄ or HCl to convert REEs into soluble sulfates or chlorides, then water-leached.  Improved in‐situ and heap leaching methods are also being piloted.  For example, the Round Top (Texas) deposit uses sulphuric acid heap leaching to dissolve REEs from glassy rhyolite.  After leach, ion exchange or solvent extraction recovers Y and other REEs from the liquor. (These hydrometallurgical steps overlap extraction and separation phases.)  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The workhorse for REE separation.  Multi-stage countercurrent solvent extractions (using organophosphorus reagents like D2EHPA or trialkylphosphine oxide) sequentially separate Yttrium, heavy-REEs, and light-REEs.  For instance, Lynas Malaysia’s plant uses SX to split Nd/Pr, Ce/La, and heavier elements (including Y) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-rare-earths-supply-chain-springs-into-gear-2024-06-17/#:~:text=,by%202025%2C%20alongside%20recycling%20initiatives)).  Allied players are building similar plants (e.g. Lynas’ Texas HREE SX plant, Iluka’s Kwinana SX refinery).  SX flowsheets are tailored so that Yttrium can be pulled out either with heavy-REEs or via a dedicated strip stage.  
• **Ion Exchange & Chromatography:**  Rare-earth ions (including Y³⁺) adsorb on functional resins.  Continuous ion-exchange chromatography (CIX/CIC) is being demonstrated for REE separation.  For example, a 2019 US pilot (Wheat Ridge, CO) will use continuous ion-exchange to separate heavy REEs from “Round Top” feed ([tmrcorp.com](https://tmrcorp.com/news/press_releases/2019/index.php?content_id=210#:~:text=,scale%20to%20full%20industrial%20capability)).  Ion-exchange is cleaner and can achieve very high purities, making it a key technology for high‐grade Yttrium recovery in future allied refineries.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Precipitation:** After SX or IX, REE eluates are precipitated.  In batch processes, reagents like oxalate or hydroxide (via NH₄OH) precipitate the REEs.  Controlled precipitation (often as oxalates) purifies Y by selectively forming double sulfates or oxalates (Zöllner double salts, for example, co-crystallize La/Ce but leave Y in solution).  Subsequent calcination yields high-purity Y₂O₃.  
• **Molten Salt & Metal Refining:** For metal products, REE chlorides or fluorides (e.g. YCl₃, YF₃) are electrolyzed in molten salts to produce metal.  MP Materials plans molten-salt electrolysis for Nd/Pr (Hall-Héroult type), and similar methods can produce Y metal.  Yttrium metal refining itself is done by electrorefining in molten LiCl–YCl₃ at ~710 °C, followed by vacuum distillation at ~880 °C to remove salt ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/electrorefining-yttrium/#:~:text=Tests%20on%20electrorefining%20of%20yttrium,remove%20salt%20from%20the%20metal)). These high-temperature electrochemical processes produce >99.9% pure Y metal.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Oxide Refinement:** High-purity Y₂O₃ is obtained by repeated precipitation and calcination.  For example, ammonium hydroxide precipitates Y⁺³ as Y(OH)₃, which is washed and calcined to oxide with <50 ppm impurities.  Solvent-cleaning agents (phosphate scavengers, chelators) are used to remove trace actinides and iron.  Final Y₂O₃ can be refined by zone-melting or by dissolving/re-precipitating to remove any remaining contaminants (similar to rare-earth oxide polishing for optical grade).  
• **Metal Production:** Yttrium metal is produced from purified oxide by chemical reduction or electrolysis.  A common route is electrolysis of YF₃ or YCl₃ in molten CaCl₂/CaF₂ (calciothermic reduction) or molten LiCl–KCl baths.  Electrowinning can yield ductile Y metal.  Post-electrolysis, Y ingots are melted in vacuum arc or induction furnaces to degas (esp. remove O/N) and cast into bars or powder.  Advanced processes (e.g. roll casting, melt-spinning) produce specialized Y-alloys and ultra-fine powders for electronics (sub-micron Y₂O₃ powders via sol-gel methods for lasers/LEDs).  
• **Magnet/Alloy Fabrication:** Although Y is not a major magnet component, for completeness: Y-containing magnets or alloys are made by vacuum induction melting of RE-E alloys (e.g. NdFeB with small Y additions for grain growth control).  Melt is cast into ingots, broken (hydrogen decrepitation), milled, and sintered into magnet shapes.  Vacuum annealing can enhance Y diffusion in Yttrium-Iron garnets (used in microwave devices). These downstream processes finalize yttrium into functional materials.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Management & Neutralization:** Rare-earth mining produces radioactive (Th/U-bearing) tailings.  Western operations emphasize engineered disposal.  Tailings are thickened and filtered to remove excess water; solids are capped with protective liners or inert rock.  Alkaline neutralization (lime dosing) is used to prevent acid runoff from heavy-mineral processing. For example, Lynas’ Kalgoorlie project will store water-leached purification (WLP) residue in dry-landform cells with synthetic covers to isolate thorium-rich dust ([www.epa.wa.gov.au](https://www.epa.wa.gov.au/proposals/lynas-kalgoorlie-rare-earths-processing-facility#:~:text=Lynas%20Kalgoorlie%20Rare%20Earths%20Processing,operate%20a%20new%20Rare%20Earths)).  
• **Wastewater Treatment:** Process effluent (spent leach solutions, rinse waters) is recycled as much as possible. Secondary treatments precipitate residual REEs and actinides: raising pH causes RE-hydroxides to form; sulfide precipitation removes heavy metals. Advanced adsorbents (ion-exchange columns, ferric hydroxide beds) capture trace actinides/REEs. Continuous water monitoring ensures discharge meet EPA limits.  
• **Reagent Recovery & Destruction:** Spent organophosphorus solvents (from SX) are reclaimed by solvent-stripping or incineration. Spent acids are concentrated and recycled or neutralized (e.g. gypsum precipitation from H₂SO₄). Ion-exchange columns are periodically regenerated or disposed as radioactive waste.  Modern refiners use closed-loop SX systems and catalytic oxidation units to break down organics, minimizing environmental release.  
• **Dust & Emission Controls:** Dry operations (crushing, grinding) generate fine dust with RE and Th content. Facilities deploy baghouses and wet scrubbers to keep airborne particulates <10 mg/m³. Collected dust is returned to circuit or stored safely. High-temperature processes (calcining, smelting) have fume-scrubbers and HEPA filters.  Research is ongoing (using lime filters, plasma techniques) to remove fluoride and rare-earth aerosol emissions.  
• **Land Reclamation:** Upon mine closure, pits and tailings ponds must be stabilized. Western mines plan progressive backfilling (with low-grade waste rock) and revegetation with native flora.  In karst or sensitive areas, in-situ neutralization (liming) is applied to prevent groundwater contamination. These best-practice measures aim for eventual post-mine land use without legacy contamination.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The principal bottleneck is **rare-earth separation and refining capacity**.  Western mines can produce REE concentrates, but converting them to pure yttrium compounds requires large-scale chemical processing plants that currently do not exist at the needed scale.  For example, Western SX refineries typically process only ~5 kt/yr of REO, compared to ~35 kt/yr by a single Chinese plant ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rare-earth-elements-2025-strategic-importance/#:~:text=,extraordinarily%20complex%20chemical%20processes%20required)).  In practical terms, US and allied supply chains can mine and concentrate yttrium‐bearing ore, but face a shortage of domestic SX/IX facilities to isolate and purify Yttrium.  In short, the hardest gap is building the complex solvent-extraction (and related hydrometallurgy) plants to produce yttrium oxide/metal at scale.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The **separation/refinement stage** is the bottleneck: although the US and allies can mine critical ores, they lack large-scale facilities to isolate pure yttrium. Western refineries are limited to a few thousand tonnes per year ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rare-earth-elements-2025-strategic-importance/#:~:text=,extraordinarily%20complex%20chemical%20processes%20required)), far below future needs.  Until new SX/CIX plants (e.g. Lynas/Texas, Iluka/WA, SRC/Canada) come online, domestic supply of high-purity yttrium will remain severely constrained ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rare-earth-elements-2025-strategic-importance/#:~:text=,extraordinarily%20complex%20chemical%20processes%20required)). This processing limitation — not raw ore — is the rate-limiting step in allied yttrium supply.
