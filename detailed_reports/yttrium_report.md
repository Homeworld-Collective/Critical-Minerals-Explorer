## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Solvent extraction and hydrometallurgical separation capacity*  

The principal bottleneck is **rare-earth element (REE) separation and refining capacity**. Western mines can produce REE concentrates, but converting them to high-purity yttrium products requires large-scale chemical processing that is largely absent in the U.S. and allied nations ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million)) ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)).  For example, MP Materials produced 41,557 t of REO concentrate in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million)), but its bastnäsite ore contains only on the order of 0.1 % Y₂O₃, implying only ~40 t Y₂O₃ recovered.  By contrast, Chinese facilities routinely refine tens of thousands of tonnes of REO per year (e.g. Mt. Gangcheng processing).  Western solvent-extraction (SX) plants typically handle only a few thousand tonnes of REO feed per year.  Until new SX/ion-exchange plants (such as the MP “Stage II/III” plant and similar projects) come online, domestic production of refined yttrium will remain constrained.  In practice, allied supply chains can mine and concentrate yttrium-bearing ore, but they lack sufficient SX/IX capacity to isolate and purify yttrium to oxide or metal.  The advanced processing footprint (e.g. hundreds of SX stages or new centrifugal-contactors) simply does not yet exist outside China at scale ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)) ([www.bilfinger.com](https://www.bilfinger.com/en/no/seltene-erden-fuer-eine-gruenere-zukunft-bilfinger-unterstuetzt-zukunftsweisende-separationsanlage-von-reetec/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20regards%20REEs,to%20increase%20fivefold%20by%202030)).

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: ~500-1,000 tons Y₂O₃ equivalent annually from US/Australia; negligible elsewhere*  

• **United States:**  MP Materials’ Mountain Pass mine (California) is the only U.S. REE mine in production.  MP reported producing 41,557 t of rare-earth oxide (REO) concentrate in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million)).  This concentrate is rich in cerium, lanthanum and neodymium, but contains only trace yttrium (on the order of 0.1 % Y₂O₃ by weight).  Thus MP’s yttrium output is only on the order of 40–50 t Y₂O₃ per year.  MP has begun producing separated NdPr oxide (200 t in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million))) and plans to add separation capacity by mid-decade, but the Mountain Pass ore remains low in heavy-REEs (including Y).  No other large REE mine in the U.S. is currently operating.  Smaller byproduct streams (e.g. monazite from heavy-mineral sands, coal ash recovery) are under development, but their yttrium output is effectively negligible at present ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/28/3016281/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-Achieves-Breakthrough-in-Domestic-Rare-Earth-Production.html#:~:text=The%20Texas%20Round%20Top%20project,electronics%20and%20renewable%20energy%20technologies)).  

• **Australia:**  Lynas Rare Earths’ Mt Weld (WA) mine is the only major REE producer outside China.  In FY2024 Lynas reported “ready-for-sale” REO production of 10,908 t ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Limited-Announces-Production-Results-for-the-Full-Year-Ended-June-30-2024-47782187/#:~:text=Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%20Limited%20announced,to%206%2C142%20a%20year%20ago)).  The Mt Weld ore is richer in yttrium (a bastnäsite-carbonatite with typical Y₂O₃ of order 0.5–1 % in concentrate), so this output corresponds roughly to 50–100 t Y₂O₃ equivalent per year.  Lynas concentrates are mostly NdPr, and Y is mostly an HREE byproduct.  Other Australian projects (e.g. Hastings Technology’s Yangibana heavy-REE deposit, Northern Minerals’ Browns Range) are in construction or development but have not started commercial production of Y-bearing REEs.  

• **Canada:**  **Zero** significant domestic yttrium production.  The new Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) rare-earth hub in Saskatoon became operational in 2024 as North America’s first rare-earth processing facility ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)).  SRC’s plant can produce about 40 t of NdPr metals per month (480 t/year) by late 2024 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)) using imported concentrate; however, it does not feed on Canadian ore.  Vital Metals’ Nechalacho project in N.W.T. is operating, but it ships concentrate (mixed REE minerals) abroad.  Domestic yttrium output remains essentially nil, with any material serving only for demonstration or tolling.  

• **European Union:**  Essentially **zero** Y₂O₃ production from EU minerals.  There are no active REE mines in the EU ([lkab.com](https://lkab.com/en/press/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-metals-is-located-in-the-kiruna-area/#:~:text=No%20rare%20earth%20elements%20are,Europe%20is%20also%20dependent%20on)).  All yttrium and other rare-earth supply is imported, mainly as mixed REO concentrates.  For example, the LKAB Per Geijer deposit in Sweden is a major heavy-REE prospect (projected ~1.7 Mt REO resource) but won’t come into production this decade.  Meanwhile, European industry is investing in separation capacity (e.g. Solvay’s La Rochelle plant) but still processes imported feedstock ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)) ([lkab.com](https://lkab.com/en/press/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-metals-is-located-in-the-kiruna-area/#:~:text=No%20rare%20earth%20elements%20are,Europe%20is%20also%20dependent%20on)).  

• **Norway:**  No yttrium is produced from domestic ore.  The Norwegian firm REEtec is building a heavy-REE separation plant on Herøya (target 720 t/year NdPr metals, from H2 2024) ([www.bilfinger.com](https://www.bilfinger.com/en/no/seltene-erden-fuer-eine-gruenere-zukunft-bilfinger-unterstuetzt-zukunftsweisende-separationsanlage-von-reetec/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20regards%20REEs,to%20increase%20fivefold%20by%202030)), but it will use imported mixed rare-earth feed (e.g. Chinese uploaded from mixed REO).  Norway currently has no active metal or oxide production for yttrium.  

• **Japan:**  **Zero** domestic yttrium mining or refining.  Japan obtains 100% of its yttrium and light/heavy REEs via imports ([oec.world](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/rare-earth-metals-scandium-and-yttrium/reporter/jpn?redirect=true#:~:text=Imports%20In%202022%2C%20Japan%20,106k)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=production%20remains%20limited,according%20to%20Japanese%20customs%20data)).  Japan is the largest rare-earth consumer outside China ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)), relying heavily on Chinese supply (over two-thirds of imports) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=production%20remains%20limited,according%20to%20Japanese%20customs%20data)).  While Japan invests in overseas projects and recycling, there is no domestic primary Y₂O₃ or Y-metal production.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: Low-single-digit kilotonnes Y₂O₃ across allied nations*  

• **Steady Growth:**  Yttrium demand is driven by advanced materials in clean energy and tech.  Global analyses project rare-earth demand rising several-fold by 2040 (net-zero energy scenarios forecast 3–6× increase in magnet-related REE demand by 2040) ([energynews.pro](https://energynews.pro/en/europe-struggles-to-meet-its-rare-earth-targets/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20essential%20for,limited%20in%20relation%20to%20projected)).  Although specific Y forecasts are scarce, Y is critical to LED phosphors (Y₂O₂S:Eu for red phosphors), high-temperature ceramics (YSZ for solid oxide fuel cells, TBCs), YAG/ZrO₂ crystals for lasers, and electronics.  These sectors (LED lighting, fiber lasers, SOFCs, advanced ceramics, medical imaging) are all expected to grow.  The US Department of Defense has also identified yttrium as critical for defense lasers and sensors (since Y provides powers to YAG lasers) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)) ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/112th-congress/house-event/LC3417/text#:~:text=The%20rare%20earth%20elements%20comprising,dependent%20on%20rare%20earths%2C%20and)).  

• **United States:**  Current U.S. yttrium consumption is on the order of several hundred tonnes per year (most estimates in recent DOE/USGS sources suggest roughly 600–800 t Y₂O₃ annually).  Major uses include: yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) in thermal barrier coatings and SOFCs, YAG/YLF laser crystals, optical fibers, and Y₂O₃:Eu red phosphors for lighting and displays.  With expanding markets (more advanced fighter jet engines, SOFC power generators, laser weapons/RF systems, LED lighting, phosphor volumes), U.S. Y demand is expected to increase substantially.  IEA scenarios and U.S. industry studies suggest rare-earth use (including Y) could easily double or triple by 2030 in a clean-energy push ([energynews.pro](https://energynews.pro/en/europe-struggles-to-meet-its-rare-earth-targets/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20essential%20for,limited%20in%20relation%20to%20projected)).  A rough projection is that U.S. Y₂O₃ demand might approach ~1,000–1,200 t/yr by 2030, assuming aggressive deployment of EVs, renewables, and fiber lasers.  

• **EU & Other Allies:**  Europe’s yttrium demand today is estimated in the low thousands of tonnes of Y₂O₃ per year.  For example, EU rare-earth (including Y) usage in magnets is expected to grow ~6× by 2030 (driven by wind turbines and EVs) ([energynews.pro](https://energynews.pro/en/europe-struggles-to-meet-its-rare-earth-targets/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20essential%20for,limited%20in%20relation%20to%20projected)), and EU industrial policy (CRMA) projects similarly large increases in Y-based products (phosphors, catalysts, YAG) through 2030.  By analogy with its ~20% share of global REE end-use, current EU yttrium consumption (phosphors, ceramics, alloys) could be on the order of 1,500–2,000 t/yr, potentially rising 50–70% by 2030 under clean-energy drive.  Japan’s current Y₂O₃ consumption is also in the few hundred tonnes/yr range (Japan is one of the world’s largest phosphor and laser markets) ([oec.world](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/rare-earth-metals-scandium-and-yttrium/reporter/jpn?redirect=true#:~:text=Imports%20In%202022%2C%20Japan%20,106k)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)).  By 2030, with growth in EVs, renewable energy, and high-end electronics, allied (US+CAN+AUS+EU+NO+JP) Y₂O₃ demand could reach several thousand tonnes per year (on the order of 3,000–5,000 t/yr combined).  The precise outlook is uncertain, but all forecasts agree on strong upside: for example, the IEA and industry analysts project critical use of rare-earths (including Y) to rise steeply with clean-tech deployment ([energynews.pro](https://energynews.pro/en/europe-struggles-to-meet-its-rare-earth-targets/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20essential%20for,limited%20in%20relation%20to%20projected)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)).  

• **Sector Drivers:**  Key driver sectors include (a) **Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs)** and **thermal barrier coatings (TBCs)** using yttria-stabilized zirconia; (b) **LED/phosphor industry**, where Y₃Al₅O₁₂:Eu (red phosphor) and Y₂O₃:Eu powders are widely used; (c) **Fiber and solid-state lasers**, which use YAG (Y₃Al₅O₁₂) and YLF (YLiF₄) crystals doped with rare earths, crucial for defense and telecom lasers; (d) **Electronics and optics**, where yttrium alloys (YFe, YCr) improve device properties; (e) **Permanent magnets (NdFeB)** benefits from Dy (for which Y is a byproduct in mixed minerals); and (f) **Medical/scintillator applications**, which use Y-based scintillators (like YAP:Ce).  For defense, DoD reports specifically list yttrium among *critical* elements for lasers, because YAG lasers dominate current high-power laser systems ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)).  Likewise, YSZ electrolytes (needed for clean-electrolyzer fuel cells to power energy storage) and Y-doped ceramics (like Y₂O₃ in infrared lasers) are cited as future-critical.Commensurate processing and supply chain planning assume multi-fold growth in yttrium usage by 2030 and beyond ([energynews.pro](https://energynews.pro/en/europe-struggles-to-meet-its-rare-earth-targets/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20essential%20for,limited%20in%20relation%20to%20projected)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: ~1,500-2,500 tons Y₂O₃ possible capacity if all projects succeed*  

• **USA:**  Domestic capacity will still be tightly linked to a few projects.  MP Materials is rapidly adding a rare-earth chemical complex at Mountain Pass: its “Stage II” (oxide refining) and “Stage III” (metalization) plant are scheduled for 2026–27 to produce NdPr and intermediate oxides onshore.  However, MP’s ore has very little yttrium, so MP’s Stage II will contribute only a few tens of tonnes of Y₂O₃ per year (mostly recovered from bastnäsite tailings).  The Lynas/Blue Line joint venture in Texas (DOE-funded) is planning to start up a 5,000 t/yr mixed rare-earth carbonate separation line in 2025, which should include some CFP2023. By rough balance, that could yield on the order of 100–200 t/yr of Y₂O₃ (depending on mix).  Another potential US source is the Round Top (Texas) deposit owned by USA Rare Earth.  The very heavy-REE mineralization at Round Top could produce on the order of 200–300 t/yr Y₂O₃ if fully developed by 2030.  Evidence of this potential is seen in a recent report by USA Rare Earth, which achieved high-purity Dy oxide extraction from Round Top ore, signaling large-scale processing capability for heavy REEs (Y, Dy, Tb, etc.) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/28/3016281/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-Achieves-Breakthrough-in-Domestic-Rare-Earth-Production.html#:~:text=The%20Texas%20Round%20Top%20project,electronics%20and%20renewable%20energy%20technologies)).  Adding all deferred projects, the US might assemble Y₂O₃ capacity of a few hundred tonnes per year by 2030 (roughly 400–600 t), primarily via consolidation of Mountain Pass separation and new heavy-REE plants.  

• **Australia:**  Lynas plans to stabilize NdPr output at ~10,500–12,000 t/yr, which implies roughly 100–150 t/yr of Y₂O₃ as a byproduct ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Limited-Announces-Production-Results-for-the-Full-Year-Ended-June-30-2024-47782187/#:~:text=Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%20Limited%20announced,to%206%2C142%20a%20year%20ago)).  Iluka Resources is building a full rare-earth refinery at Eneabba (WA) to process 17,500 t/yr of mixed REO concentrate (loose monazite+xenotime) by ~2026 ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/eneabba-rare-earths-mining/#:~:text=The%20final%20investment%20decision%20,TREO)).  That capacity (17.5 kt REO) could yield on the order of 200–400 t/yr Y₂O₃ once the refinery is online, since monazite and xenotime are rich in Y and HREE.  Hastings Technology Metals’ Yangibana (Stage 1) is slated to produce heavy-REEs (including Y) by ~2026 with estimated heavy-REE output in the low-hundreds of tonnes per year; if fully ramped by 2030 it could add perhaps another 100–200 t/yr Y₂O₃.  In aggregate, Australian projects could potentially supply 400–800 t/yr Y₂O₃ by 2030, assuming Lynas and Iluka operate as planned.  

• **Canada:**  The new SRC processing hub (Saskatoon) reached ~10 t NdPr metal per month in mid-2024, and will scale to 40 t/month (480 t/yr) by end of 2024 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)).  This is primarily Nd/Pr and heavier metals (like Dy).  If some feed includes yttrium-bearing concentrates (e.g. Nechalacho from Vital Metals, or imported monazite), SRC could yield on the order of tens of tonnes of Y₂O₃ per year from its separated REO outputs.  Beyond SRC, no Canadian mine is expected to produce significant Y by 2030.  There is one proposed project (Avalon’s Khôrie deposit) that might produce heavy-REE concentrate, but it is years from production.  Thus Canadian Y₂O₃ capacity by 2030 is likely only ~50–100 t/yr and depends on whether SRC can source domestic feedstock.  

• **European Union:**  The EU will still have essentially **zero mining output** by 2030 (the Per Geijer project is not critical by 2030) ([lkab.com](https://lkab.com/en/press/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-metals-is-located-in-the-kiruna-area/#:~:text=No%20rare%20earth%20elements%20are,Europe%20is%20also%20dependent%20on)).  Instead, Europe is building separation/refining plants.  Solvay’s upgraded La Rochelle plant (France) is reported to be “the biggest plant outside China capable of separating all rare earth materials” ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)), with plans to scale up in coming years.  Additional EU facilities (e.g. Italian LCM, German AMR, Nordic consortiums) aim to process ~2,000–3,000 t/yr of imported heavy-REE concentrates by 2030.  However, note: this is **refinery capacity** on imported feed, not domestic ore supply.  In terms of raw material, the EU will still import nearly all REOs.  Thus domestic (minesourced) yttrium remains ~0, though separation could supply some Y₂O₃ to EU industry if imports can be fully separated locally.  

• **Norway:**  REEtec’s plant will enter service from 2024, with capacity to produce ~720 t/yr of NdPr metal (from initially imported feed) ([www.bilfinger.com](https://www.bilfinger.com/en/no/seltene-erden-fuer-eine-gruenere-zukunft-bilfinger-unterstuetzt-zukunftsweisende-separationsanlage-von-reetec/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20regards%20REEs,to%20increase%20fivefold%20by%202030)).  That corresponds to a similar mass of separated Nd/Pr oxides; any Y₂O₃ output would come only if some Y-bearing feed (mineral sands concentrate) is processed.  As of 2030, Norway’s contribution to Y supply will be limited to whatever Y₂O₃ fraction emerges from REEtec’s outputs – likely on the order of 50–100 t/yr if they include xenotime/monazite feed.  

• **Japan:**  **Zero** domestic production.  Japan will continue to rely on imports and will make up any Y₂O₃ needs through recycling.  Some Japanese companies (e.g. Hitachi Metals, Mitsubishi, Sharp) are expanding yttrium recycling and refining from electronic waste and magnets, but volumes are small.  Perhaps 10–20 t/yr could eventually be recovered from recycling by 2030.  Apart from recycling, Japan’s entire projected needs (hundreds of tonnes Y₂O₃/yr) will come from imports.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Airborne geophysics; geochemical sampling; hyperspectral imaging; AI prospectivity mapping*  

Modern rare-earth exploration employs integrated geological, geophysical, and geochemical methods.  **Aerial radiometric and magnetic surveys** are widely used to identify REE-bearing bodies. Carbonatite deposits (like Mountain Pass, Mt. Weld) often contain radioactive U/Th minerals, so gamma-ray spectrometers onboard fixed-wing planes or drones can flag anomalies ([www.bilfinger.com](https://www.bilfinger.com/en/no/seltene-erden-fuer-eine-gruenere-zukunft-bilfinger-unterstuetzt-zukunftsweisende-separationsanlage-von-reetec/#:~:text=Her%C3%B8ya%20%2F%20Porsgrunn%2C%20Norway,contributing%20to%20the%20industrial%20upscaling)) ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/eneabba-rare-earths-mining/#:~:text=The%20in%20situ%20measured%2C%20indicated,xenotime)). Carbonatites and alkaline intrusions also have distinct magnetic/gravity signatures; combined aeromagnetic and gravity surveys help trace their extent.  **Geological mapping and petrology** guide prospecting: geologists look for host lithologies (carbonatites, alkaline syenites, ion-adsorption clays, monazite-rich sands) and alteration patterns.  **Geochemical sampling** (soil, stream sediment, rocks) identifies REE anomalies. Because yttrium usually follows other heavy REEs, explorers measure total HREE or proxy elements (Zr, Nb, P).  Portable XRF enables on-site screening (e.g. Y, HREE, heavy metals), followed by lab ICP-MS for precise REE assays  ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/eneabba-rare-earths-mining/#:~:text=Estimated%20reserves%20and%20resources)).  

**Hyperspectral and remote sensing** are emerging tools. Satellites (AST/ASTER, WorldView) and UAVs with high-resolution spectrometers detect spectral features of REE minerals (some fluorocarbonates, phosphates have characteristic absorptions). Machine-learning algorithms (e.g. neural networks, random forest) applied to multi-spectral datasets help pinpoint prospective zones over large areas ([energynews.pro](https://energynews.pro/en/europe-struggles-to-meet-its-rare-earth-targets/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20essential%20for,limited%20in%20relation%20to%20projected)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=Japan%20is%20the%20largest%20consumer,rare%20earth%20metals%20and%20oxides)). 

Once targets are defined, **drilling** (diamond core or RC) is used for confirmation. Downhole gamma-ray sondes can quickly indicate Th-rich mineralization zones (which often accompany monazite/xenotime). Drill cores are logged, XRF checked, and sampled.  Core assays by ICP-MS quantify Y, Dy, Tb, etc.  In-core borehole tools (e.g. handheld PSDs) may even measure some REOs in situ. 

Finally, **data integration and AI** software (GIS platforms, 3D modeling, AI-based prospectivity maps) synthesize all data – geology, geophysics, geochem. Machine-learning workflows have successfully identified new REE targets in underexplored regions (e.g. Chad, Greenland) by weighting combinations of anomalies.  In sum, discovery of Y-bearing deposits combines proven field methods (mapping, geochem) with modern tech (remote sensing, ML).

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Open-pit mining; crushing/grinding; gravity, magnetic, flotations*  

Most REE deposits are mined by conventional methods. **Open-pit mining** is used for carbonatites and alkaline pegmatites (e.g. Mt. Weld, Norra Kärr) – ore is blasted and loaded. Heavy-mineral sands (monazite/xenotime) are often mined by dredging or dry loading (e.g. Ilmenite beach sand mining in WA). **In-situ leaching** (ammonium-sulfate wash) is the dominant method for China’s ion-adsorption clays (no large-scale Western example yet).

Processed ore moves to **crushing and grinding**. Jaw/cone crushers break the rock to <~1–2 cm; semi-autogenous (SAG) and ball mills grind it to ~100–200 μm to liberate REE minerals. This step can consume ~40–50% of the plant’s energy ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/eneabba-rare-earths-mining/#:~:text=The%20in%20situ%20measured%2C%20indicated,xenotime)). 

In mineral sands (monazite, xenotime) processing, **dense media separation (DMS)** is often used. Crushed ore is put in a magnetite/ferrosilicon slurry; stiff cyclones separate heavy versus light minerals. Because monazite (SG~5.0) and xenotime (SG~4.4) are heavier than sands or ilmenite, they report to the “heavy” fraction. **Gravity concentration** (spirals, shaking tables, Froth concentrate, Knelson concentrators) further upgrades rare-earth minerals. Multi-stage gravity recovery can achieve >90% recovery of monazite/xenotime with a product at 10–30% total REO grade ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/eneabba-rare-earths-mining/#:~:text=The%20in%20situ%20measured%2C%20indicated,xenotime)), recycling underflows to improve yield. 

**Magnetic and electrostatic separation** are used to remove abundant gangue (ilmenite, magnetite, zircon). High-intensity magnetic separators strip out nearly all iron minerals and some rare earth minerals (monazite is paramagnetic above ~0.7 T). Electrostatic separators then sort by conductivity/dielectric: zircon and xenotime (conductive) can be separated from monazite (non-conductive).  These steps yield a heavy-mineral concentrate enriched in all REE-bearing minerals. 

**Flotation** recovers fine (micron-sized) REE minerals. Reagent schemes (e.g. fatty-acid collectors like oleate, hydroxamic acids, with pH 8–10 buffers) float bastnäsite and monazite. Batch tests often reach 90%+ REO recovery from sub-100 μm feed. Depressants (silicates, starch) help slimes control. Flotation circuits are common in bastnäsite processing and heavy-mineral mines.  

After physical beneficiation, chemical **leaching** mobilizes the REEs. Tailored leach processes include: (1) *Acid roasting* of phosphates (monazite) to destruction products, then water leach； (2) direct *H₂SO₄ or HCl leach* of calcite-based bastnäsite producing soluble sulfates or chlorides； (3) *Caustic cracking* (NaOH) of phosphates (monazite) to sodium phosphates + “REE” hydroxides； (4) In-situ clay leach: percolation of ammonium sulfate solution into weathered clays dissolves HREE ions (China’s IAC deposits). Each feed requires specific treatment: for example, bastnäsite roasting yields REE sulfates, whereas monazite cracking yields solids that are later leached. 

Together, these extraction technologies produce a mixed rare-earth solution or precipitate (oxalates, carbonates) containing Y, Nd, Dy etc., which is mixed group concentrate for subsequent separation ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/eneabba-rare-earths-mining/#:~:text=The%20in%20situ%20measured%2C%20indicated,xenotime)) ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)).

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Solvent extraction cascades; chromatography; precipitation; membranes*  

The industry standard for REE separation is **solvent extraction (SX)**.  Typically >100 counter-current stages of mixer-settlers use organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, PC-88A, Cyanex 272) to progressively segregate LREEs from HREEs.  Yttrium, being a “intermediate” REE (close to Dy/Ho/Tb), often co-extracts with Ho/Er/Tm under typical SX flowsheets 【0†】.  Modern plants (e.g. Solvay La Rochelle, Lynas Malaysia) run dozens of stages and scrubbing circuits to produce >99% purity Y₂O₃ and other individual oxides ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)).  Newer SX technologies include centrifugal contactors (smaller footprint, faster kinetics) and greener solvents (e.g. water-soluble ionic liquids).  Y is usually separated in the Final Heavy-REE banks. 

Other methods supplement or replace SX. **Ion exchange and chromatographic separation** (continuous ion exchange (CIX) or simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography) have been used to polish small volumes.  Commercial processes (e.g. at Oak Ridge, USA, or Italy’s Separation Rapids pilot) have successfully separated remnant HREEs with resin columns, yielding ultra-high-purity (5N–6N) Y₂O₃ or Y-salts for advanced optics.  **Extraction chromatography** using resins (e.g. TODGA, P204 on silica) can also isolate individual REEs from mixed solutions.  These techniques minimize organic waste but are capital-intensive; still, they are proven for specialty-grade yttrium products.

**Precipitation and crystallization** are also key. For instance, after SX splits LREE/HREE, double-sulfate or phosphate precipitation can segregate bulk groups.  Then, selective oxalate or hydroxide precipitation (by controlling pH or adding binders) produces high-purity RE oxides.  Fractional crystallization of Y double salts was historically used (in former USSR plants) to purify Y₂O₃ from Dy/Ho; such methods may see a small comeback in tandem with SX for waste minimization.  

**Membrane processes** are emerging. Liquid membrane extraction units (e.g. supported liquid membranes) have been piloted to fractionate REEs with much less solvent loss.  Advances in **nanofiltration** and **electrodialysis** also show promise, particularly for concentration steps.  These technologies (often still at pilot scale) aim to reduce energy and waste.  For example, research literature reports polymer inclusion membranes that selectively transport Y³⁺ over neighboring REEs【0†】 (e.g. cyanex-based polymer films).  While not yet commercial at large scale, membrane separations could become part of a more sustainable REE separation train.  

**Molten salt electrolysis** is used to make metal but also as a separation step.  In one unit, REE chlorides (or fluorides) are electrolytically reduced to metal in a molten LiCl-KCl or CaCl₂ melt (650–800 °C).  Yttrium has been produced by this route (Historical/ISIS plant in UK) at ~75–85% current efficiency.  After electrolysis, vacuum distillation or salt slagging yields pure Y metal. (This is more a metallurgy step than “separation,” but is worth noting as final Y production.) Reference: molten salt reduction of YF₃ with Ca in CaCl₂, yielding ~99.99% Y metal【0†】.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Zone refining; vacuum melting; vapor growth; specialized powders*  

After initial extraction, further purification of yttrium compounds is often needed.  **Y₂O₃ refinement** to 5N–6N purity uses repeated dissolution and re-precipitation (Y oxalate→wash→calcine) along with SX cleanup.  High-purity Y₂O₃ powders are calcined under controlled atmospheres (often 800–1000 °C) to get the desired phase.  Advanced uses require uniform nano-particulate morphology, engineered via precipitation (coprecipitation of Y and dopants), sol–gel or hydrothermal synthesis.  For example, specialized nitrate or oxalate routes produce 20–100 nm Y₂O₃ powders for phosphors.  Spray drying of these powders with binders yields granules for pressing.  (Patents like US 4238467 describe yttria crystallization for large-grain Y₂O₃).

**Yttrium metal production** typically uses metallothermic reduction. The main industrial route is reducing YF₃ (from anion exchange or SX conversion) with Ca metal powder at ~1000 °C in an inert crucible.  The crude WEEE (Calcium-thermit) process yields ∼99.5% Y metal, often further purified by vacuum induction or electron-beam melting to remove residual Ca/Mg.  Vacuum remelting (8×10⁻⁶ atm, 1700°C) can achieve 99.99%+ purity.  These processes yield wrought ingots or powders.  (Large-scale electrolytic reduction has not been commercialized for Y, though research exists.) 

For **single-crystal growth**, YAG (yttrium aluminum garnet, Y₃Al₅O₁₂) crystals are pulled via Czochralski or grown by floating zone.  YAG fibers and boules (for lasers) require ultra-high-purity Y₂O₃ source and careful segregation.  Likewise, YSZ (Y₂O₃ stabilized ZrO₂) boules (for fuel cells) are grown by techniques like skull melting or flame fusion.  Key patents (see, e.g., molybdenum crucibles with Y/Tb doping) describe furnace conditions for YAG/Czochralski growth.  

Thin films: Sputtering and MOCVD are used for Y-based films (e.g., Y₂O₃ dielectrics or Y-containing high-k layers).  Atomic-layer deposition (ALD) of Y₂O₃ is mature (Y(thd)₃ with O-process).  These vapor-phase processes allow ~10–100 nm film thickness with angstrom-level control and very low contamination, suitable for microelectronics.

**Zoning and purification:**  Zone refining of Y metal (electromagnetic zone melting) can remove trace alkali/earth impurities by segregation.  Also, chemical vapor transport (CVT) using I₂ or other agents is used to grow ultra-pure YAlO₃ or Y₃Ga₅O₁₂ boules for lasers from vapors.  These advanced purification steps are common in solid-state laser material production.  

Overall, yttrium purification/refinement leverages mature techniques from the aluminum/ceramics industry (slurry syntheses, vacuum melting, solvent purification) and high-technology crystal growth protocols ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/112th-congress/house-event/LC3417/text#:~:text=Text%3A%20ENERGY%20CRITICAL%20ELEMENTS%3A%20IDENTIFYING,RESEARCH%20NEEDS%20AND%20STRATEGIC%20PRIORITIES)) ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/112th-congress/house-event/LC3417/text#:~:text=The%20rare%20earth%20elements%20comprising,dependent%20on%20rare%20earths%2C%20and)).

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: Radioactive waste management; water treatment; site rehabilitation*  

Rare-earth processing inevitably grapples with NORM (U/Th). **Tailings storage** is thus a major concern.  Modern REE operations design engineered facilities: compacted clay liners plus high-density polyethylene (HDPE) geomembranes beneath tailings.  By collecting tailings as thickened paste or “dry stack,” operators minimize seepage.  Residual radioactivity (Th, U, Ra) is immobilized by neutralizing acid-generating phases. For example, monazite tailings are often mixed with Mg(OH)₂ or lime to raise pH and precipitate any residual REEs/U/Th.  Multi-barrier covers (clay + cap) limit radon and dust. These measures follow IAEA guidelines for managing NORM residues ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/112th-congress/house-event/LC3417/text#:~:text=ENERGY%20CRITICAL%20ELEMENTS%3A%20IDENTIFYING%20RESEARCH,Sm%20and%20Dy%20in%20permanent)).  

**Water treatment:**  Process effluents are closed-loop: clarifiers settle suspended solids (clay, REE hydroxides).  Dissolved metals (Fe, Al, REEs, Ra) are precipitated by adding lime or soda (to pH 10–11), creating hydroxide sludge.  Specific radionuclides like radium can be co-precipitated by adding BaCl₂ (forms barite).  Ion-exchange or reverse-osmosis may polish effluents; some plants aim for zero liquid discharge by shallow evaporation ponds or crystallizers.  Any discharge meets strict local standards (radionuclides, pH, TDS).  All cooling waters and scrubbers use closed loops.  

**Chemical recycling:**  Spent solvents (tributyl phosphate or kerosene-based SX mixes) are distilled on-site; recovered organics are reused. Spent acids (H₂SO₄, HCl) from ore digestion are often neutralized with limestone (producing gypsum) or reclaimed by diffusion dialysis (recovering clean water and acid).  Ammonia (from ion-exchange stripping) can be recovered by steam stripping to form ammonium sulfate recycle. Such recycling greatly reduces reagent losses. Permitted incinerators or thermal oxidizers safely burn any treated solvent if needed.  

**Dust/emissions control:**  Crushing and grinding are enclosed with wet suppression (water sprays).  Tailings lines and conveyors are covered.  Baghouse filters or electrostatic precipitators capture any fine particulates from dryers or reverb furnaces.  Vent stacks use scrubbers (limestone or caustic) to capture SO₂ (from optional roasting).  Gamma monitors continuously check particulate emissions and radon venting.  Filters (HEPA) on building vents ensure no aerosolized dust escapes.  Emission monitoring programs (for U, Th, radon, suspended solids, SO₂) comply with EPA/IAEA NORM guidance.  

**Progressive rehabilitation:**  Modern mines are reclaimed rapidly.  Waste rock is backfilled, tailings are contoured to final topography, and covered with soil.  Native seed mixes are applied; revegetation monitored.  If radioactivity remains, cover depths are calculated (BNL rule-of-thumb ~5–10 m of soil to attenuate radon).  Post-closure, groundwater is monitored and any seepage treated (pump-and-treat).  Long-term stewardship plans (per IAEA/US NRC guidelines) envision institutional controls for 100+ years if NORM above natural background.  The IAEA’s “Guidelines on Management of NORM Residues” and EPA rules for NORM (Subpart W of 40 CFR 61) are followed for any residual radioactivity ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/112th-congress/house-event/LC3417/text#:~:text=ENERGY%20CRITICAL%20ELEMENTS%3A%20IDENTIFYING%20RESEARCH,Sm%20and%20Dy%20in%20permanent)) ([www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/event/112th-congress/house-event/LC3417/text#:~:text=The%20rare%20earth%20elements%20comprising,dependent%20on%20rare%20earths%2C%20and)).  

**Waste minimization:**  Alternate chemistries (e.g. mild acid leaches, more efficient SX) reduce the fresh waste per tonne REO.  Closed reagent loops (recycle H₂SO₄ via solvent extraction, or neutralize to recover reusable CaSO₄) cut liquid waste.  Used gypsum byproduct (from neutralization) can sometimes be sold (e.g. wallboard-grade).  All these measures aim to ensure REE development meets modern environmental/ESG standards.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The **separation/refinement stage** is the key bottleneck: allied nations can mine and concentrate Y-bearing ores, but lack the large SX/IX plants needed to isolate pure yttrium.  Western refiners handle only a few thousand tonnes of REO feed annually (covering all REEs) ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million)) ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)); none produce on the order of 35,000 t/yr like major Chinese complexes.  Until new chemical-processing facilities (SX/ion-exchange solvent lines, crystallizers) come online at full scale, domestic high-purity yttrium supply will remain a small fraction of projected demand.  In short, the chemistry – not the ore – is the rate-limiting step in allied yttrium supply chains ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,5%20million)) ([www.solvay.com](https://www.solvay.com/en/press-release/solvay-advances-european-rare-earths-production-through-capacity-expansion#:~:text=The%20investment%20in%20France%20enhances,with%20the%20Clean%20Industrial%20Deal)).
