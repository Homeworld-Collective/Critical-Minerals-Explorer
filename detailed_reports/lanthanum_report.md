## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Solvent extraction separation; hydrometallurgical processing; waste management infrastructure*

The critical bottleneck is **separation and purification** of lanthanum from other REEs using multi-stage solvent extraction (SX).  Typical processing flowsheets require dozens of mixer–settler stages to achieve high-purity lanthanum – for example, Xie *et al.* note that achieving individual REE separation can involve “up to hundreds of stages” ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259134005_A_critical_review_on_solvent_extraction_of_rare_earths_from_aqueous_solutions#:~:text=technical%20performance,configurations%20for%20rare%20earth%20separations)).  These complex SX circuits use specialized organophosphorus reagents and generate large volumes of spent acids, waste organic solvents, and naturally radioactive residues.  Such refining is energy-intensive, costly and produces hazardous waste streams ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259134005_A_critical_review_on_solvent_extraction_of_rare_earths_from_aqueous_solutions#:~:text=technical%20performance,configurations%20for%20rare%20earth%20separations)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-rare-earth-metals-why-are-they-demand-2025-02-26/#:~:text=60,friendly%20extraction%20technologies)).  China’s REE refining commands ~91% global share by aggressive subsidies, whereas Western producers (focusing on mining) have struggled with the high cost and regulatory burden of such extensive hydrometallurgy ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259134005_A_critical_review_on_solvent_extraction_of_rare_earths_from_aqueous_solutions#:~:text=technical%20performance,configurations%20for%20rare%20earth%20separations)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-rare-earth-metals-why-are-they-demand-2025-02-26/#:~:text=60,friendly%20extraction%20technologies)).  In short, lack of mature, high-capacity separation plants outside China – and the need for continuous multi-stage SX (often 20–40 stages or more) – remains the chief bottleneck for scaling up allied lanthanum refining (Xie *et al.*, 2014; Reuters, 2025).

**Key Bottleneck Summary:** Efficiently separating lanthanum (and Ce) from other light REEs requires large SX circuits and custom extractants ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259134005_A_critical_review_on_solvent_extraction_of_rare_earths_from_aqueous_solutions#:~:text=technical%20performance,configurations%20for%20rare%20earth%20separations)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-rare-earth-metals-why-are-they-demand-2025-02-26/#:~:text=60,friendly%20extraction%20technologies)).  Western firms currently lack modern, large-scale SX/refining plants for lanthanum, so allied production remains constrained until new facilities (e.g. Lynas/Texas SX unit, Energy Fuels’ planned plant) are built and proven.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~5,000-7,000 tons La₂O₃ equivalent annually*

• **United States (Mountain Pass, CA):** MP Materials’ Mountain Pass is the only U.S. REE mine ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/mp-materials-posts-smaller-loss-rare-earths-production-surges-2025-08-07/#:~:text=surge%20in%20production%20amid%20rising,further%20increases%20expected%20next%20quarter)).  Recent reports state MP exceeds ~40,000 metric tons of REO production per year ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=Exceeded%2040%2C000%20metric%20tons%20of,for%20the%20third%20consecutive%20year)) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,approximately%201%2C300%20metric%20tons%20of)) (an all-time U.S. record), most as bastnäsite concentrate.  In late 2023 MP began Stage II separation, shipping NdPr oxide and ramping up cerium/lanthanum product output.  For example, MP reported ∼1,300 t of NdPr oxide and "lanthanum and other separated products" in 2024 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,approximately%201%2C300%20metric%20tons%20of)).  Based on Mountain Pass ore grades (~25–30% of REO as Ce/La) and initial Stage II capacity, separated La₂O₃ production is on the order of a few thousand tonnes per year (MP stage II ramping) (MP Materials, 2025; USGS).  

• **Australia (Lynas, Mt Weld):**  Lynas Rare Earths produced ~10,900 t total REO from Mt Weld in FY2024 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=1117%20%20,Total%20NdPr%20production)) (with NdPr =5,655 t).  The ore is highly enriched in light REEs: by composition ∼30% of Mt Weld REO is the Ce+La duo, with La₂O₃ itself ~20–25% of the mix.  In FY2024 this implies roughly 2,500–3,000 t La₂O₃ contained.  Lynas is expanding production (targeting ~10,500 t NdPr/year by 2025 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=accordingly,production%20is%20expected%20in%20CY2025))), which proportionally increases by-product lanthanum output.  However most Mt Weld concentrates are sent to Lynas Malaysia for processing, so exact lanthanum recoveries depend on those facilities.  

• **Canada:**  There is currently no commercial lanthanum mining in Canada.  Saskatch­ewan’s SRC operates a pilot-scale REE facility that in 2024 produced purified NdPr metal (10 t/month) from imported monazite feed ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=produced%20rare%20earth%20metals%20at,do%20so%20in%20North%20America)), but it has not yet produced separated La₂O₃.  Planned Canadian projects (e.g. Vital Metals' Nechalacho, Search Minerals' Foxtrot) are still in development; no commercial larthanum output exists yet.  

• **EU & Norway:**  No active native lanthanum mining or refining as of 2024.  Europe’s projects (e.g. LKAB/Norra Kärr in Sweden, Greenland’s Kvanefjeld) are in exploration or permitting.  For example, Sweden’s LKAB estimates its Per Geijer REE project could meet ~18% of Europe’s needs if developed, but commercial outputs are not expected until the 2030s at the earliest ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/swedens-lkab-says-it-could-meet-18-europes-rare-earth-needs-with-per-geijer-mine-2025-01-28/#:~:text=Sweden%27s%20LKAB%20company%20stated%20that,decade%20and%20still%20requires%20approvals)).  Current allied lanthanum production is essentially zero.  

• **Japan & Iceland:**  Neither country has domestic lanthanum mining.  Japan relies entirely on imports (primarily from Australia and China) for its small REE needs, and Iceland has no mining despite trace occurrences.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary:  Tengaged by catalysts, glass, etc., projected ~15-25 kt La₂O₃*

• **Petroleum Catalysts (FCC):**  Fluid cracking catalysts (FCC) are by far the largest use of lanthanum ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Batteries%3B%20catalysts%20for%20petroleum%20refining%3B,based%20on%20projected%20supply%20risks)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/publications/rare-earth-elements-end-use-and-recyclability#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20elements%20are%20used,of%20rare%20earth%20elements%20used)).   Lanthanum-rich rare earths (mixed with Ce) are added to FCC catalysts to improve reactivity and extend life.  U.S. and allied refiners (hundreds of FCC units globally) consume several thousand tonnes of La₂O₃/year.  With modest growth in refining (especially clean-fuel units), allied demand in this sector could reach the high single-digit kilotonnes of La₂O₃ by 2030.  

• **Battery Applications:**  Earlier demand from NiMH batteries (which use La-rich Mischmetal) is waning as Li-ion dominates. Remaining NiMH uses (stationary grid storage, some hybrid vehicles) will still use lanthanum into the 2030s, but at much-reduced levels.  Current estimates for allied NiMH and other battery-related La₂O₃ demand are on the order of 1–2 kt/yr (falling further by 2030) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Batteries%3B%20catalysts%20for%20petroleum%20refining%3B,based%20on%20projected%20supply%20risks)).  (In new markets, La is not major—Nd/Dy are critical for EV magnets.)  

• **Glass/Optics & Ceramics:**  Lanthanum oxide is used in specialty glass (high-refractive-index camera and aviation optics) and in luminescent/optical ceramics.  These niche industries in allied countries consume on the order of 1–2 kt La₂O₃ annually today.  Modest growth (new lens materials, lasers, polished glass) might raise demand to ~3–4 kt/yr by 2030 ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Batteries%3B%20catalysts%20for%20petroleum%20refining%3B,based%20on%20projected%20supply%20risks)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/publications/rare-earth-elements-end-use-and-recyclability#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20elements%20are%20used,of%20rare%20earth%20elements%20used)).  

• **Other Applications:**  Miscellaneous uses (e.g. lanthanum-based mischmetal for steel desulfurization, polishing compounds, phosphors) together consume a few hundred to ~1 kt La₂O₃ per year among US/allies, and are expected to remain relatively stable through 2030. 

Overall, total allied lanthanum demand by 2030 is projected in the mid ten-thousand tonnes range, driven overwhelmingly by refining catalysts and steady specialty uses ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/publications/rare-earth-elements-end-use-and-recyclability#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20elements%20are%20used,of%20rare%20earth%20elements%20used)) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Batteries%3B%20catalysts%20for%20petroleum%20refining%3B,based%20on%20projected%20supply%20risks)). 

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 12,000-18,000 tons La₂O₃ projected capacity*

• **United States:**  MP Materials plans to reach >10,000 t of mixed REO (separated oxides) per year by 2030, roughly 25–30% of which would be lanthanum (≈3,000–4,000 t) as Stage III completes and new SX circuits come online ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,approximately%201%2C300%20metric%20tons%20of)).  Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill is developing monazite processing: Phase 1 can separate ~1,000 t NdPr/yr now ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=battery%20powered%20electric%20vehicles%20%28,Energy%20Fuels)) and is designing larger capacity by 2027.  Combined U.S. capacity for La₂O₃ could plausibly reach on the order of 4,000–5,000 t/yr by 2030 (MP Materials; Energy Fuels).  

• **Australia:**  Lynas’ expansions (Mt Weld processing plus planned U.S. and Malaysian SX units) will scale up allied supply.  By 2025 Lynas plans ~10,500 t NdPr output ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=accordingly,production%20is%20expected%20in%20CY2025)); proportional increases in Ce/La recovery would yield several thousand tonnes more lanthanum per year.  Factoring that and other regions of Australia, globally-registered Lynas production could supply on the order of 6,000–8,000 t La₂O₃/year by 2030 (Lynas Rare Earths, 2024).  

• **Canada:**  Key projects (Vital Metals’ Nechalacho, Search Minerals’ Foxtrot) aim to come online in late 2020s.  If successfully funded and built, they might contribute on the order of 1–2 k t La₂O₃ by 2030.  However, timelines are uncertain.  (Ally-sourced concentrate processing under development, e.g. Vital partnership with CEO, suggests some potential.)  Otherwise, lanthanum output from Canada is negligible until these projects materialize ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=produced%20rare%20earth%20metals%20at,do%20so%20in%20North%20America)).  

• **Europe, Japan, Norway, Iceland:**  No significant production is expected by 2030.  Europe's nascent REE projects (e.g. Sweden’s Per Geijer, Russia/Greenland schemes) face long lead times and likely won’t produce REOs commercially until the mid-2030s ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/swedens-lkab-says-it-could-meet-18-europes-rare-earth-needs-with-per-geijer-mine-2025-01-28/#:~:text=Sweden%27s%20LKAB%20company%20stated%20that,decade%20and%20still%20requires%20approvals)).  Japan and Iceland import essentially all lanthanum; domestic supply remains effectively zero.

**Total Allied Supply (~2030):**  Summing planned projects yields roughly 12,000–18,000 t La₂O₃ annual capacity.  This still leaves a gap relative to projected demand (a potential shortage on the order of several kt per year) unless additional projects succeed or recycling/policy interventions occur.
