## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States (Mountain Pass, CA):** MP Materials (formerly Molycorp) is the only active REE mine. It generates a bastnäsite ore concentrate with mixed REOs (≈15% of U.S. REE supply ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=Since%20acquiring%20the%20Mountain%20Pass,the%20United%20States%20Geological%20Survey))). Modernized operations are ramping up in‐country refining. MP is planning to produce separated light-REE oxides (Nd–Pr, **Ce, La**) in its new processing plant ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20will%20focus%20on,used%20to%20make%20more%20specialized)).  Current US output (as rare-earth concentrates) is on the order of ~100,000 t REE/year (including all light RE oxides), roughly matching the provided 102,750 MT/Y estimate.  
• **Australia (Lynas, Mt Weld):** Lynas Rare Earths produces ~10.9 kt/year of mixed REO concentrate (FY2024) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1489285/lynas-corporation-reo-production-volume/#:~:text=As%20of%20fiscal%20year%20ended,a%20plant%20in%20Kuantan%2C%20Malaysia)).  Its Mt. Weld bastnäsite deposit outputs rare-earth carbonate containing lanthanum. In Q4’22 Lynas reported 4,457 t REO for 3 months ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2530073-lynas-to-ramp-re-output-back-up-after-oct-dec-drop#:~:text=The%20company%20produced%20901t%20of,December%202022)), implying ~9–11 kt/yr REO capacity by 2024 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2530073-lynas-to-ramp-re-output-back-up-after-oct-dec-drop#:~:text=Lynas%20now%20expects%20to%20produce,second%20quarter%2C%20Lynas%20said%20today)). At ~3–4% La₂O₃ content in that concentrate (based on Mt. Weld geochemistry ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370654288_Mineralogy_and_Distribution_of_REE_in_Oxidised_Ores_of_the_Mount_Weld_Laterite_DepositWestern_Australia#:~:text=6,2250%203770%2060%201%203090))), lanthanum oxide production is on the order of 300–400 t/month (few thousand t/yr).  
• **Canada:** No operating lanthanum mine yet, but a new Saskatchewan Research Council facility is toll-processing imported RE concentrates into metals. SRC has demonstrated ~10 t/month Nd–Pr metal (metals grade) production and will eventually separate light-REEs (including La) from monazite feed ([magazine.cim.org](https://magazine.cim.org/en/news/2024/rare-earths-milestone-en/#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%2C%20which%20is,facility%E2%80%99s%20output%20sometime%20next%20year)) (expected full-scale ~400 t NdPr/yr by 2025). Thus direct Canadian lanthanum output is ~0 now, but small (order 100 t/yr of La₂O₃) in ramp-up.  
• **EU & Norway:** Currently no active lanthanum mining.  Europe and allied states (e.g. Norway) are evaluating carbonatite and ion-adsorption clay deposits (e.g. Sweden’s Norra Kärr, Greenland’s Kvanefjeld) but see only exploration and permitting. Domestic production is effectively zero, making Europe dependent on imports.  
• **Japan & Iceland:** No domestic REE mining (Iceland’s geology is basaltic, barren of REEs; Japan has no REE mines). Japan’s lanthanum demand (<1 kt/yr last decade) is met by imports (mostly from China/Lynas).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Petroleum Catalysts (FCC):** La₂O₃ is a promoter in fluid catalytic cracking catalysts ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Batteries%3B%20catalysts%20for%20petroleum%20refining%3B,glass%2C%20television%20faceplates%2C%20mirrors%2C%20optical)).  U.S. and allied refineries (e.g. Gulf Coast, North Sea, East Asia) consume catalyst containing lanthanum potentially amounting to *thousands* of tonnes of La₂O₃ per year by 2030. (Estimates: a large refinery replacing FCC catalyst annually may use ~10–20 t La₂O₃; with dozens of refineries, combined demand is on the order of 1–5 kt/yr lanthanum oxide.)  
• **Nickel-metal Hydride Batteries:** Hybrids and NiMH batteries use lanthanum-rich alloys.  A Toyota Prius uses ≈4.5 kg of lanthanum metal (10 lb) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=To%20put%20use%20quantities%20in,unit%20includes%204%20magnets%20that)).  By 2030, projected Western hybrid/EV production (Japan, US, Europe) on the order of millions of vehicles could consume tens of thousands of tonnes of La (oxide equivalent). For example, 10 million hybrids would use ~45,000 t La metal (≈50,000 t La₂O₃). (NiMH demand is stabilizing, but any growth in hybrids or NiMH backup systems keeps lanthanum demand in the multi-thousand-ton range.) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=To%20put%20use%20quantities%20in,unit%20includes%204%20magnets%20that))  
• **Glass/Optics & Ceramics:** Lanthanum oxide is used in specialty glass (camera lenses, phosphors, high-refractive-index glass).  Allied precision optics and lighting industries collectively use *hundreds* of tonnes annually (projected to grow with photonics). Ceramics and metal alloys (e.g. battery alloys, lighting phosphors) add a few hundred more tonnes. These uses are smaller than batteries/catalysts but still notable.  
• **Other (Magnets, Polymers):** Small amounts of lanthanum are used in mischmetal for brazing alloys and NiMH precursor (each ton of NdFeB magnets uses a few kg La). Polymer catalysts and polishing compounds also consume lanthana. Combined “other” uses likely total only a few hundred tonnes by 2030.  
Overall, US+allied lanthanum demand by 2030 is expected to be on the order of **10–20 thousand tonnes per year (oxide basis)**, driven mainly by catalysts and batteries as above. (For context, non-China world demand was ~12,000 t La₂O₃ in 2017 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/450101/global-lanthanum-oxide-demand-outside-of-china-forecast/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20displays%20a%20forecast,12%2C091%20metric%20tons%20in%202017)), and projected to rise with green-tech growth, giving a similar ballpark.) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/450101/global-lanthanum-oxide-demand-outside-of-china-forecast/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20displays%20a%20forecast,12%2C091%20metric%20tons%20in%202017))  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** Planned projects (monazite or bastnaesite-based) could supply several thousand tonnes per year.  Energy Fuels Inc. (Utah White Mesa Mill) is expanding from a 10,000 t/yr monazite plant (yielding ~905 t La₂O₃) to a 60,000 t/yr plant (≈5,427 t La₂O₃) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Rare%20Earth%20Oxide%20%20,46)).  Mountain Pass (California) will produce separated cerium and lanthanum oxides when its new refinery comes online ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20will%20focus%20on,used%20to%20make%20more%20specialized)).  Together, US sources could provide on the order of 5–6 kt La₂O₃/yr by 2030 (assuming full commissioning and government support ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Rare%20Earth%20Oxide%20%20,46)) ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20will%20focus%20on,used%20to%20make%20more%20specialized))).  
• **Australia:** Lynas is expanding capacity. With 9–10 kt/yr REO today (per ArgusMedia projections ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2530073-lynas-to-ramp-re-output-back-up-after-oct-dec-drop#:~:text=Lynas%20now%20expects%20to%20produce,second%20quarter%2C%20Lynas%20said%20today))), and planned expansions at Mt. Weld, Australia will continue producing ~paletized carbonates containing lanthanum.  If capacity grows to ~15 kt/yr REO by 2030 as planned, La₂O₃ output could approach ~3–4 kt/yr (as a portion of the REO mix). (Lynas also plans to ship ore to a planned U.S. processing plant, bolstering allied supply.)  
• **Canada:** Once SRC’s RE plant and any new mines start up, Canada may produce a few hundred tonnes of La₂O₃ per year by 2030 (long lead times imply most supply will still come from imports).  
• **Europe, Japan, Norway, Iceland:** These jurisdictions are expected to have near-zero new lanthanum production by 2030. European projects (e.g. Tasman Metals Norra Kärr) are still in exploration. Japan and Norway lack mines. Official allied strategy is to import concentrate or get it toll-processed (e.g. US and Australia are courting Japan and EU off-takers). 
• **Total Allied Supply (~2030):** Sum of allied production could reach on the order of 10–15 kt La₂O₃/yr (from US + Australia + some Canada) by 2030 under optimistic assumptions ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Rare%20Earth%20Oxide%20%20,46)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2530073-lynas-to-ramp-re-output-back-up-after-oct-dec-drop#:~:text=Lynas%20now%20expects%20to%20produce,second%20quarter%2C%20Lynas%20said%20today)). This still falls short of demand, implying continued reliance on imports or additional mining projects.

• EPA Rare Earths Review (2012) – REE production uses and flows, including lanthanum uses and processing stages ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=used%20in%20permanent%20magnets%2C%20computers%2C,Goonan%2C%202011)) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=safety%20concern%2C%20as%20well%20as,Production%20and%20management%20of)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric/Gamma Surveys:** Many lanthanum-bearing minerals (monazite, bastnäsite) carry Th/U, emitting gamma radiation. Airborne or ground radiometric surveys detect these radioactive anomalies, highlighting REE prospects ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Detailed%20spectral%20data%20from%20remote,1995)). For example, earlier rare-earth finds (e.g. Mt. Weld) were aided by U/Th exploration.  
• **Remote Sensing (Hyperspectral):** Satellite or aerial hyperspectral imaging identifies REE-associated mineralogy (carbonates, ferruginous clays) and alteration signatures ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Detailed%20spectral%20data%20from%20remote,1995)). Terrain with spectral signatures of Th-enriched carbonatites or clays can guide detailed ground follow-up.  
• **Geological Mapping / Geochemistry:** Geologists target known REE host rocks (carbonatite complexes, alkaline igneous intrusions, continental pegmatites, or ion-adsorption clays). Detailed mapping and geochemical soil/stream sediment sampling look for lanthanum (and accompanying Ce, Nd, Y) anomalies.  Proven carbonatite deposits (e.g. Mountain Pass) guide explorers to analogous terranes ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=match%20at%20L914%20The%20principal,almost%20exclusively%20the%20two%20phosphate)) where lanthanum might accumulate.  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Magnetic and gravity surveys can identify subsurface carbonatite bodies (distinct density/magnetic signatures). Electrical resistivity or induced-polarization may highlight clay-rich (ion-adsorption) zones. Such geophysics complements radiometric methods in narrowing down prospects for drilling.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Mining & Milling:** Lanthanum ores (ore-grade ~5–10% total REO) are typically mined via open pit/dredging. After removal, the ore is crushed and ground to liberate RE-bearing minerals.  
• **Flotation & Gravity Concentration:** Ground ore is fed into flotation cells (using surfactants and pH modifiers) to separate hydrophobic REE minerals (bastnäsite, monazite fragments) from gangue ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=4,sieve%20prior%20to%20separation%20by)). Gravity separators can also concentrate dense monazite/thorianite grains, and magnetic separation can remove iron-bearing gangue. At Mountain Pass, a multi-stage flotation circuit upgrades REO from ~7% in raw ore to 60–90% ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=4,sieve%20prior%20to%20separation%20by)) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=ground%2C%20it%20is%20crushed%20so,often)).  
• **Roasting/Cracking:** For carbonate minerals, a calcination step (500–600 °C) may be used to remove carbonates and organics.  Bastnäsite can be “cracked” with NaOH (alkaline roast) to dissolve fluorine and carbonate, leaving sodium rare-earth carbonates. Monazite (phosphate) is often roasted and then acid-leached. These thermal/chemical steps mobilize the REEs into leachable form.  
• **Leaching (Hydrometallurgy):** The concentrate (or roasted ore) is leached with acids or caustics to dissolve REEs.  Example: processing monazite often uses 70% NaOH digestion to produce RE hydroxides, which are then acid-leached to yield a solution of rare-earth chlorides ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=4,purity)).  Filtration and washing remove solid wastes, resulting in a purified RE-rich liquor.  
• **Precipitation and Intermediate Products:** After leaching, lanthanum can be precipitated as hydroxide or carbonate by pH adjustment.  For bastnäsite, Mountain Pass calcines then leaches the crushed concentrate, washing and calcining to boost REO to 90% ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=processes%20include%20leaching%2C%20washing%2C%20filtering%2C,leaving%20the%20other%20lanthanides%20in)). Lanthanum often reports to a precipitated “lanthanum hydrate” or carbonate. This yields a middling product (≥90% REO) for further separation.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The workhorse for separating La from other REEs.  In multilayer mixer-settlers, organic extractants (e.g. organophosphorus reagents) selectively bind RE cations from the aqueous feed.  Multiple stages (often >10) “strip” one element at a time.  For example, after acid digestion, Mountain Pass uses multistage SX to isolate high-purity La (as hydroxide) and other lanthanides ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=contained%20cerium%20to%20plus%20four,l%20in%20Appendix%20C)). Energy Fuels likewise plans SX to produce separate La₂O₃, CeO₂, Nd₂O₃, etc. ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=rare%20earth%20hydroxides,purity)). This process yields 95–99.99% pure oxide products.  
• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatography:** Synthetic resins (e.g. iminodiacetates) or ion-imprinted polymers can fractionate lanthanum via affinity differences. Although less common than SX at scale, ion-exchange columns are used in pilot/research settings to polish separations or recycle process waters.  
• **Selective Precipitation:** Adjusting pH or adding specific reagents can precipitate certain REEs.  For instance, raising pH of an SX strip solution precipitates La(OH)₃ while keeping Ce in solution (since a Ce⁴⁺ phase forms).  Likewise, mixtures of La/Ce can be separated by precipitating double-sulfate salts (e.g. K₂La₂(SO₄)₄) under controlled conditions. These techniques complement SX to yield pure La oxide or hydroxide.  
• **Electrochemical Methods:** In development: e.g. electro-winning from molten chlorides (producing metal), or electro-deposition from aqueous streams. (Currently niche, not yet commercial for lanthanum.)  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metallothermic Reduction (Smelting):** The standard route to metal.  High-purity La₂O₃ is mixed with a reactive metal (Ca or Al) and heated (~1200–1600 °C) in a refractory furnace.  The reductant(s) scavenge oxygen, freeing lanthanum metal.  Calcium reduction (calciothermic) yields molten lanthanum which is cast into ingots or mischmetal alloy (Fe–La).  This is the **most widely used** purification method ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Metallothermic%20reduction%20,and%20%20free%20the%20metal)).  
• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Lanthanum can be produced by electrolysis of chloride or fluoride melts (e.g. LiCl–KCl with dissolved LaCl₃).  An electric current drives La³⁺ ions to the cathode, depositing metal.  This method (analogous to aluminium smelting) is practiced in some countries for light lanthanoids. ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Metallothermic%20reduction%20,and%20%20free%20the%20metal))  
• **Vacuum/Osmic Distillation:** Because La has a very high boiling point, vacuum distillation can purify lanthanum metal by evaporating and re-condensing it at reduced pressure.  This removes ionic impurities. Vacuum arc melting or zone refining can further increase purity to 99.99%+. ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Metallothermic%20reduction%20,and%20%20free%20the%20metal))  
• **Fluidized Bed Chloride Reduction:** (e.g. the Ames Process variant) A gaseous metal halide (LaCl₃ vapor) is passed over a hot alkali earth metal, depositing high-purity La metal. This gas-phase reduction can produce very pure lanthanum. (Not widely commercial, but demonstrated in labs.) ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Metallothermic%20reduction%20,and%20%20free%20the%20metal))  
• **Refinement & Alloying:** Final products include La metal, La–Fe/Ce mischmetal, or La master alloy with aluminium/iron. High-purity rare-earth alloys (≥99.9% La) are produced in specialty facilities (USA: Santoku America; allied: Dowa Japan, etc.) for use in electronics and research ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=Metallothermic%20reduction%20,and%20%20free%20the%20metal)).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Radium/Radon Management:** Tailings from lanthanum ores often contain thorium/uranium decay products.  EPA data show waste radiation levels up to 3,224 pCi/g ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=safety%20concern%2C%20as%20well%20as,Production%20and%20management%20of)).  Tailings are treated by precipitating radium (e.g. adding barium or sulfate to co-precipitate RaSO₄) and capping them under impermeable covers.  Facilities use engineered barriers and venting systems to keep radon (Rn) emissions minimal ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=safety%20concern%2C%20as%20well%20as,Production%20and%20management%20of)).  
• **Water Treatment & Recycling:** Process effluents (acidic or alkaline) are handled via neutralization and membrane filtration.  Many US plants employ reverse osmosis (RO) to purify ~90% of wastewater, recovering clean water and concentrate ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=osmosis%20,RTI%20International%2C%202011)).  The RO concentrate is then chemically treated in an on-site chlor-alkali unit to regenerate HCl/NaOH for reuse ([nepis.epa.gov](https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=P100EUBC.TXT#:~:text=osmosis%20,RTI%20International%2C%202011)).  This minimizes discharge and recycles reagents. Any residual brine is neutralized (e.g. with limestone) to precipitate dissolved REEs, heavy metals and fluorides as stable solids.  
• **Solid Waste Stabilization:** Wastes (spent ore, filter cakes, slag) are often cemented or encapsulated.  For example, lanthanum-rich residues can be incorporated into concrete matrices, immobilizing any remaining radionuclides.  Phosphate or sulfate co-precipitation can lock up heavy metals (e.g. Pb, As) in tailings.  Vegetative covers and soil amendments (phosphates, biochar) are used on tailings piles to reduce dust and leaching. Emerging research (phytoremediation) is also exploring metal-accumulating plants to clean low-grade tailings, though this is not yet commercial.  
• **Airborne Dust Control:** Tailings ponds are kept wet, and dust collection systems (baghouses and scrubbers) filter fine particles.  Fluoride-laden gases (from bastnäsite processing) are scrubbed with lime to precipitate CaF₂. Strict particulate controls and emission scrubbing address airborne REE/Th particulates.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is **separation and purification** of lanthanum from other REEs.  Current hydrometallurgical flowsheets are extremely complex (on the order of 50–100 SX stages or steps) ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTwo%20different%20rare%20earth%20elements,separate%20and%20purify%20the%20metals)), requiring many solvents and generating large waste streams. This makes expansion of domestic production costly and slow.  No major Western facility currently has the throughput or technology (solvent circuits, waste management) to cheaply handle multi-kiloton La projects.  In short, despite new mines, the lack of scalable, green separation and refining technology (and associated qualified facilities) remains the rate-limiting step in US/allied lanthanum production ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTwo%20different%20rare%20earth%20elements,separate%20and%20purify%20the%20metals)).

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Efficiently separating and purifying lanthanum (and other rare earths) is extremely difficult and expensive.  Existing SX-based processes involve dozens of stages and hazardous reagents ([www.nationaldefensemagazine.org](https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/2/10/us-begins-forging-rare-earth-supply-chain#:~:text=%E2%80%9CTwo%20different%20rare%20earth%20elements,separate%20and%20purify%20the%20metals)), so building out large-scale allied capacity is slow.  In practice the lack of established processing plants (solvent extraction and metal refining) outside China remains the chief bottleneck.  Until these refining challenges are solved or streamlined, allied lanthanum production will lag behind demand.
