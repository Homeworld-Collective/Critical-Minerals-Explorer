## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Solvent extraction separation; hydrometallurgical processing; waste management infrastructure*

The critical bottleneck is **separation and purification** of lanthanum from other REEs. Current hydrometallurgical flowsheets require complex multi-stage solvent extraction (SX) processes with typically 20-40 stages, demanding specialized solvents and generating substantial waste streams. This complexity makes expansion of domestic production costly and slow. No major Western facility currently matches Chinese throughput or cost-efficiency for multi-kiloton lanthanum projects. Despite new mining projects, the lack of scalable separation and refining technology and associated qualified facilities remains the rate-limiting step in US/allied lanthanum production.

**Key Bottleneck Summary:** Efficiently separating and purifying lanthanum from other rare earths requires complex, expensive solvent extraction processes with dozens of stages and specialized reagents. The lack of established processing plants with modern separation technology outside China remains the chief bottleneck. Until refining capacity is expanded and processes are streamlined, allied lanthanum production will lag behind projected demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~5,000-7,000 tons La₂O₃ equivalent annually*

• **United States (Mountain Pass, CA):** MP Materials operates the only active REE mine in the US, producing approximately 43,000 metric tons of rare earth concentrate (containing ~15% REO) annually as of 2023. The facility began producing separated REOs including lanthanum oxide in late 2023 with its Stage II operations. Current separated lanthanum production is estimated at 2,000-3,000 tons La₂O₃ per year, ramping up as processing capacity expands.

• **Australia (Lynas, Mt Weld):** Lynas Rare Earths produced approximately 15,900 tonnes of total REO in FY2024, with Mt. Weld operations yielding rare earth concentrates containing approximately 25-27% lanthanum oxide. Based on typical Mt. Weld ore composition, current lanthanum oxide production is estimated at 3,000-4,000 tonnes annually.

• **Canada:** No commercial lanthanum production currently. The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) facility processes imported concentrates at demonstration scale, producing approximately 10 tonnes/month of mixed rare earth products. Commercial lanthanum production remains at zero, with pilot-scale operations focusing on neodymium-praseodymium.

• **EU & Norway:** No active lanthanum mining or processing. European projects remain in exploration or permitting phases (e.g., Sweden's Norra Kärr, Greenland's Kvanefjeld). Domestic production is zero.

• **Japan & Iceland:** No domestic REE mining. Japan imports all lanthanum requirements (estimated <1,000 tonnes/year) primarily from China and Australia. Iceland has no REE mining operations despite trace REE occurrences in volcanic rocks.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 15,000-25,000 tons La₂O₃ projected*

• **Petroleum Catalysts (FCC):** Fluid catalytic cracking catalysts represent the largest lanthanum application. US and allied refineries (approximately 150 major facilities globally) consume an estimated 8,000-10,000 tonnes La₂O₃ annually, projected to reach 10,000-12,000 tonnes by 2030 as refining capacity expands.

• **Battery Applications:** The shift from NiMH to lithium-ion batteries has reduced lanthanum demand in this sector. Remaining NiMH applications (stationary storage, some hybrid vehicles) are projected to consume 2,000-3,000 tonnes La₂O₃ by 2030, down from earlier projections.

• **Glass/Optics & Ceramics:** Specialty optical glass, camera lenses, and technical ceramics consume approximately 2,000-3,000 tonnes La₂O₃ annually among allied nations, with modest growth projected to 3,000-4,000 tonnes by 2030.

• **Other Applications:** Mischmetal for steel production, polishing compounds, and phosphors collectively consume 1,000-2,000 tonnes annually, expected to remain stable through 2030.

Overall US and allied lanthanum demand by 2030 is projected at **15,000-25,000 tonnes La₂O₃ annually**, driven primarily by catalysts and specialty materials rather than batteries.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 12,000-18,000 tons La₂O₃ projected capacity*

• **United States:** MP Materials targets 10,000+ tonnes of separated REO production by 2030, with lanthanum representing approximately 25-30% of output (3,000-4,000 tonnes La₂O₃). Energy Fuels' White Mesa Mill in Utah is developing monazite processing capacity targeting 2,500 tonnes of total REO by 2027, potentially yielding 500-750 tonnes La₂O₃. Combined US production could reach 4,000-5,000 tonnes La₂O₃ by 2030.

• **Australia:** Lynas plans to expand Mt. Weld production to 10,500 tonnes NdPr by 2025, with proportional increases in lanthanum output. Including the planned US separation facility and Malaysian operations expansion, Australian-sourced lanthanum production could reach 6,000-8,000 tonnes La₂O₃ by 2030.

• **Canada:** Several projects in development (e.g., Vital Metals' Nechalacho, Search Minerals' Foxtrot) could contribute 1,000-2,000 tonnes La₂O₃ by 2030 if financed and developed on schedule.

• **Europe, Japan, Norway, Iceland:** No significant production expected by 2030. European projects face lengthy permitting processes with production unlikely before 2035.

**Total Allied Supply (~2030):** Combined production capacity of 12,000-18,000 tonnes La₂O₃ annually, creating a potential deficit of 3,000-7,000 tonnes versus projected demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Radiometric surveys; hyperspectral imaging; geochemical sampling; magnetic/gravity surveys*

• **Radiometric/Gamma Surveys:** Thorium and uranium associated with REE minerals (monazite, bastnäsite) emit gamma radiation detectable by airborne or ground surveys. Modern spectral gamma-ray surveys can differentiate thorium from uranium signatures, directly indicating REE potential.

• **Remote Sensing (Hyperspectral):** Satellite and aerial hyperspectral imaging identifies REE-associated alteration minerals and host rock signatures. ASTER and Sentinel-2 data help identify carbonatites and alkaline complexes prospective for lanthanum.

• **Geological Mapping/Geochemistry:** Systematic mapping targets carbonatite complexes, alkaline intrusions, and ion-adsorption clay deposits. Stream sediment and soil sampling detect lanthanum and cerium anomalies. ICP-MS analysis provides parts-per-billion detection limits for REE pathfinder elements.

• **Geophysical Surveys:** Magnetic surveys identify magnetite-bearing carbonatites; gravity surveys detect dense carbonatite bodies. Electrical methods map clay-hosted ion-adsorption deposits. Integration of multiple geophysical datasets improves drill targeting.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Open-pit mining; crushing/grinding; froth flotation; gravity separation; magnetic separation*

• **Open-Pit Mining & Comminution:** Most lanthanum deposits are mined via open-pit methods. Ore (typically 2-10% total REO) is crushed to <10mm and ground to 75-150 microns to liberate REE minerals.

• **Flotation Concentration:** Froth flotation using fatty acid collectors and sodium silicate depressants separates REE minerals from gangue. Multi-stage flotation achieves 30-60% REO concentrates from 2-8% REO feed.

• **Gravity & Magnetic Separation:** Dense media separation and spirals concentrate heavy REE minerals (specific gravity 4-5). High-intensity magnetic separation removes iron oxides and paramagnetic gangue minerals.

• **Roasting/Cracking:** Bastnäsite concentrates undergo oxidative roasting at 500-600°C to remove CO₂ and oxidize cerium. Sulfuric acid baking at 200-300°C converts REE minerals to water-soluble sulfates.

• **Leaching (Hydrometallurgy):** Acid leaching (HCl or H₂SO₄) dissolves REEs from roasted concentrates. Caustic cracking with concentrated NaOH at 140-150°C decomposes refractory minerals like monazite. Typical REE recovery exceeds 90%.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion exchange; selective precipitation; fractional crystallization*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Primary industrial method using organophosphorus extractants (D2EHPA, PC88A) in mixer-settlers. Typical circuits require 20-40 stages to separate lanthanum from cerium and other light REEs, achieving 99%+ purity.

• **Ion Exchange:** Displacement chromatography using strong-acid cation resins provides high-purity separation for smaller volumes. Continuous ion exchange systems are being developed for industrial scale.

• **Selective Precipitation:** Double sulfate precipitation separates light from heavy REEs. Selective oxidation of cerium to Ce(IV) enables separation from La(III) via pH-controlled precipitation.

• **Fractional Crystallization:** Historical method still used in China, exploiting solubility differences of REE double salts. Energy-intensive but produces high-purity products.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Metallothermic reduction; molten salt electrolysis; vacuum distillation; zone refining*

• **Metallothermic Reduction:** Standard industrial route mixing La₂O₃ with calcium metal at 1,000-1,200°C under argon. Yields 99%+ pure lanthanum metal after vacuum remelting.

• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Electrolysis of LaCl₃ in LiCl-KCl eutectic at 450-500°C produces high-purity metal. More energy-efficient than metallothermic reduction but requires anhydrous feed.

• **Vacuum Distillation:** Sublimation at 10⁻⁴ torr and 1,400°C removes volatile impurities. Combined with zone refining achieves 99.99% purity for electronic applications.

• **Chemical Vapor Deposition:** LaI₃ thermal decomposition on hot tungsten filaments produces ultra-pure lanthanum for semiconductor applications.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Radioactive waste management; water treatment/recycling; tailings stabilization; dust control*

• **Radioactive Waste Management:** Monazite and bastnäsite processing generates NORM (naturally occurring radioactive material) waste containing thorium and uranium. Precipitation with barium sulfate removes radium; engineered covers and liners prevent radon emissions.

• **Water Treatment & Recycling:** Lime neutralization precipitates dissolved metals and fluorides. Reverse osmosis recovers 85-90% of process water. Membrane bioreactors treat organic-contaminated streams. Zero liquid discharge systems minimize environmental impact.

• **Solid Waste Stabilization:** Tailings are neutralized and stabilized with cement or geopolymers. Phosphate addition immobilizes heavy metals. Dry stacking reduces footprint versus traditional tailings ponds.

• **Air Emission Control:** Baghouses capture particulates; wet scrubbers remove acid gases and fluorides. Activated carbon adsorbs volatile organics from solvent extraction operations.
