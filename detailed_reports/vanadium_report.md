## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary:* Limited domestic processing/refining capacity across the allied supply chain is the primary constraint. Converting mined vanadium-bearing ore (especially titaniferous magnetite or disseminated sandstone vanadates) into marketable products requires large, specialized facilities that the US and participating allies currently lack.  

- **Processing Infrastructure:** No operating U.S. or allied plant today performs the high-temperature roast–leach steps needed for titanomagnetite concentrates, nor do they have vacuum-furnace capacity for ferrovanadium alloy production.  (For example, Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill in Utah is essentially a legacy uranium-mill tailings plant that reclaims vanadium from old stockpiles ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-will-fast-track-utah-uranium-mine-permit-2025-05-12/#:~:text=Wood%20project%2C%20situated%20on%20a,uranium%20production)).)  Building a new commercial-scale roast-leach plant would demand high-capex investment (hundreds of millions USD) in roasters, kilns, acid/alkali circuits, and emissions controls.  By contrast, major producers in China, Russia, South Africa and Brazil operate integrated steel/vanadium smelters (e.g. Glencore’s Rhovan facility in South Africa) where vanadium is recovered from pig-iron smelting slag ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/glencore-plans-job-cuts-south-african-ferrochrome-vanadium-operations-2025-09-01/#:~:text=South%20Africa%2C%20which%20holds%20about,been%20permanently%20or%20temporarily%20closed)).  In sum, domestically mined ore cannot be profitably refined without new processing plants that are currently absent in Western markets. Recent U.S. policy efforts (e.g. a 2025 U.S. Interior Dept. initiative) have aimed to streamline mine-waste regulations and encourage recovery of critical elements from tailings ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/us-prioritizes-recovery-critical-minerals-mine-waste-2025-07-24/#:~:text=critical%20minerals%E2%80%94such%20as%20rare%20earths%2C,global%20dominance%20in%20the%20sector)), but actual processing capacity must be built. 

- **Ore Grade and Mineralogy:**  Many prospective Western vanadium deposits are lower-grade or refractory, such as uranium-vanadium sandstones (carnotite-type) and large but magnetite-dominated titanomagnetites.  These ore types require complex reagents (alkali or acid roast) and tight control of kinetics.  Established analogies exist (e.g. apatite or bauxite processing) but vanadium lacks a standardized, low-cost extractive path.  Piloting acid/pressure leaches or alkaline roast routes at scale has remained challenging outside China and South Africa, where decades of development have optimized these processes.  Hence, even if a deposit is identified in an allied country, converting it to saleable V₂O₅ or ferrovanadium is not straightforward without first proving a viable processing flowsheet.  No “plug-and-play” large-scale chemistry is ready in the West today.  

- **Purification Capacity:**  After leaching, producing battery- or aerospace-grade V₂O₅ demands multi-step purification (solvent extraction or ion-exchange followed by ammonium-vanadate precipitation and calcination).  Very few Western facilities have developed this expertise.  (By comparison, Energy Fuels built specialized processing ponds and pilot reactors at White Mesa to obtain ultrahigh-purity V₂O₅ from tailings ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-will-fast-track-utah-uranium-mine-permit-2025-05-12/#:~:text=Wood%20project%2C%20situated%20on%20a,uranium%20production)).)  Allied industries would need to replicate such advanced hydrometallurgical/refining units.  For example, Australia’s Vecco Group only recently started an electrolyte plant, but this is downstream of V₂O₅ production ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)).  In practice, allied refiners would be months or years away from refining-scale expertise equivalent to Chinese or Russian producers.

- **Environmental and Regulatory:**  Vanadium mining in the U.S. and allied countries often coincides with uranium or thorium.  Tailings from ore processing thus contain radioactive elements and heavy metals.  Safe disposal and remediation require advanced treatment (e.g. stabilization, radon containment) under strict EPA/NRC rules.  Permitting new vanadium operations (especially roast-leach plants) is nontrivial; for instance, a proposed Utah mill re-opening must comply with EPA’s 40 CFR Part 192 radon and groundwater rules.  These environmental and land-use hurdles add time and cost, acting as a deterrent to private investment.  

**Key Bottleneck Summary:** The overarching bottleneck is **lack of sufficient processing capacity**.  Western-aligned countries have viable vanadium resources, but virtually no current domestic infrastructure (roasting/kiln complexes, autoclaves, smelters or vacuum-refining furnaces) to convert raw ore into V₂O₅ or ferrovanadium.  Consequently, nearly all vanadium demand is imported from integrated producers overseas ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/glencore-plans-job-cuts-south-african-ferrochrome-vanadium-operations-2025-09-01/#:~:text=South%20Africa%2C%20which%20holds%20about,been%20permanently%20or%20temporarily%20closed)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)). Bridging this gap will require massive new capital investment in roast-leach and refining plants, alongside supportive policy, to match the output of established suppliers. 

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary:* US output is on the order of thousands of tonnes of V per year (almost all from legacy or recycling sources); allied output is effectively zero today.  

- **United States (Active Producers):** At present the only U.S. vanadium production comes from reclamation and recycling.  Energy Fuels Inc.’s White Mesa Mill (Utah) still produces V₂O₅ by leaching old uranium-vanadium tailings (as well as remaining uranium) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-will-fast-track-utah-uranium-mine-permit-2025-05-12/#:~:text=Wood%20project%2C%20situated%20on%20a,uranium%20production)).  Independent accounts suggest this tailings operation could recover on the order of 1,000–2,000 tonnes of V₂O₅ annually if fully utilized (roughly 550–1,100 tV) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-will-fast-track-utah-uranium-mine-permit-2025-05-12/#:~:text=Wood%20project%2C%20situated%20on%20a,uranium%20production)).  Separately, U.S. Vanadium (Hot Springs, AR) chemically recovers vanadium from spent petroleum catalysts and steelmaking dust, producing high-purity V₂O₅ and vanadium electrolyte, but this is a relatively small-scale operation.  In sum, current U.S. production capacity (mostly from Energy Fuels and recycling) is on the order of **1–2 thousand tonnes of V per year**, by far below the nation’s needs.  By contrast, U.S. apparent consumption is reported in the low- to mid-10,000-tonne range annually (dominated by steel alloy demand), indicating nearly 100% import reliance.  (Domestic survey data confirm that alloy metals and steelmakers buy most vanadium from foreign producers.)  

- **Allied Nations:** No allied country currently has a dedicated primary vanadium mine or smelter in production.  Canada and most European countries (including Finland and Norway) have known vanadium occurrences (e.g. titanomagnetite in Finland’s Mustavaara, or Canada’s Lac Doré) but none has commenced commercial output to date.  Australia, despite large deposits, likewise had no operating V mine as of 2023 (see below).  Japan and Iceland have no vanadium mining.  Thus, allied consumption is met almost entirely by imports.  Globally, production is dominated by China (~50%), Russia (~20%), South Africa (~15%), and Brazil (~10–15%) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/glencore-plans-job-cuts-south-african-ferrochrome-vanadium-operations-2025-09-01/#:~:text=South%20Africa%2C%20which%20holds%20about,been%20permanently%20or%20temporarily%20closed)).  For illustration, Australia’s only large project under development (Gabanintha) has a feasibility output of about 10,100 t V₂O₅/year (~5,650 tV) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)), but that mine is not yet online.  In conclusion, **allied primary production today is effectively zero tonnes**, apart from small specialty operations (like Vecco’s new electrolyte plant) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)), so allied demand is fully satisfied by foreign suppliers.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary:* Steel and alloying needs will still dominate (>85% of demand), but energy storage is an emerging segment.  Combined U.S. and allied demand could reach tens of thousands of tonnes V per year by 2030.

- **Steel and Alloying:** Historically the vast majority of vanadium has been consumed as ferrovanadium or V₂O₅ in high-strength steel (rebar, structural, automotive grades).  Estimates vary, but industry sources put steel’s share at roughly 80–90% of vanadium use.  (For example, recent media reports note that China’s upgraded rebar standards — due in 2024–2025 — will require significantly more microalloying elements like vanadium, implying long-term higher V usage ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinese-steel-traders-seek-delay-new-rebar-standards-2024-07-24/#:~:text=over%204,term%20costs%20are%20a%20concern)).)  In the U.S. and EU, infrastructure growth and stricter rebar codes (e.g. for seismic or hurricane resilience) are expected to drive higher vanadium content in new steel.  Assuming moderate annual growth (~5–7%) in steel-related demand, U.S. consumption could roughly double from current levels by 2030 to on the order of 20,000–25,000 tonnes of V (steel + other alloys).  European demand might similarly reach the low tens of thousands of tonnes by 2030, depending on industrial output, and Japan perhaps a few thousand tonnes. (All figures assume no major shift in steel production patterns beyond current forecasts.) 

- **Energy Storage:** Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are a growing application for grid-scale energy storage.  Analysts project that cumulative global VRFB capacity could reach on the order of tens of gigawatt-hours by 2030, driven by the technology’s durability and safety.  For context, Japan’s planned expansions (e.g. Sumitomo’s national storage program) will boost battery systems from a few GWh to tens of GWh ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sumitomo-aims-install-500-mw-battery-storage-japan-by-early-2031-2024-06-05/#:~:text=potentially%20expanding%20abroad%20as%20well,the%20wholesale%20electricity%20market%2C%20government)).  Vanadium flow batteries typically require about 20–40 kg of V per kWh of storage.  If even a few GWh of VRFBs are deployed annually in allied markets, that alone would add 1,000–2,000 tonnes of V demand (in addition to steel).  For example, Vecco’s recent venture highlights this trend: they began producing electrolyte in 2023 for VRFBs and cite flow batteries’ long lifespan and scalability ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)).  Chinese and Korean projects will account for much of global VRFB growth, but allies (USA, Japan, EU) have announced pilot and utility-scale VRFB installations that could cumulatively consume 1–2 ktV per year by 2030.   

- **Total Outlook:** Summing these trends, U.S. and allied vanadium demand could easily reach **30,000–50,000 tonnes V/year by 2030**.  (Industry consultants have noted that global demand was on the order of 110,000 tonnes in 2022 and could roughly double by 2032 under high-growth scenarios.)  Steelmaking will remain the bulk of usage, but batteries and specialty chemical uses will contribute an increasingly significant slice. 

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary:* Even with all planned projects, allied primary supply by 2030 will lag demand by a wide margin.Projected outputs in key regions (2030) are on the order of a few thousand tonnes V each.

- **United States:** A modest increase in U.S. vanadium output is possible if mining restarts.  Energy Fuels holds several idle uranium-(vanadium) mines (Pandora, La Sal, Whirlwind, Rim) that could potentially feed the White Mesa Mill if market conditions improve.  In early 2025, the Biden administration fast-tracked permission for one such mine (Velvet Wood in Utah) that would produce both uranium and vanadium ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-will-fast-track-utah-uranium-mine-permit-2025-05-12/#:~:text=Wood%20project%2C%20situated%20on%20a,uranium%20production)).  If these projects and the mill ramp up, U.S. output might rise from present levels to perhaps **2,000–5,000 tV/yr** by 2030.  U.S. Vanadium’s Arkansas plant (which recycles catalyst/scap) is also expanding, but even combined these efforts likely cover only ~10–20% of projected U.S. need.  In short, the U.S. could reach a few thousand tonnes V per year domestically under aggressive scenarios, but still fall far short of demand.  

- **Australia:** Several vanadium projects are advancing. Australian Vanadium Ltd’s Gabanintha (WA) feasibility study targets ~10,100 tV₂O₅ annual output (~5,650 tV), aiming for late-2020s production. TNG Ltd’s Mount Peake (NT) plans to process titanomagnetite concentrate via its TIVAN microwave roast process (targeting ~7% V₂O₅ in ore).  Technology Metals Ltd (Yarrabubba) and others have magnetite projects with vanadium coproduct. If Gabanintha and one or two others begin operation by 2030, Australian supply could exceed **5,000–10,000 tV/yr** by the end of the decade.  (Note: Vecco’s Debella deposit hasn’t reported V₂O₅ tonnage yet, but their electrolyte output indicates additional future supply ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)).)  

- **Canada:** No vanadium production is expected by 2030.  Canada has a few advanced exploration projects (e.g. Lac Doré, Québec) but none close to construction.  Therefore Canadian output will remain **~0** through 2030, and Canada will continue to rely on imports.

- **Europe/Norway:** Europe’s only viable project is Finland’s Mustavaara deposit, whose owners are exploring a restart.  If permitted and funded, Mustavaara might produce only a few hundred tV per year in the early 2030s.  Norway’s vanadium resources are dormant.  Combined EU/Norway production by 2030 is likely in the low-hundreds of tonnes at best (<< 500 tV).  

- **Japan/Iceland:** There are no vanadium mines in Japan or Iceland.  Japan will remain entirely import-dependent, even accounting for any domestic VRFB electrolyte manufacturing.

- **Total Allied Supply (2030):** In sum, even optimistic scenarios yield at most **~7,000–16,000 tV/yr** collectively (majority from the U.S. and Australia).  This is well below the projected allied demand (~35–50 ktV).  Allied production will remain a small fraction of global supply without further breakthroughs or government interventions.

## Key Discovery Technologies
- **Radiometric Surveys:**  Many vanadium ores are chemically associated with uranium or thorium (e.g. carnotite [K₂(UO₂)₂(VO₄)₂]) in sandstones or black shales.  Airborne or ground gamma-ray spectrometer surveys can identify uranium-enriched rock, which often co-locates with vanadium mineralization.  This approach was historically used to discover V–U deposits in the Colorado Plateau and Jordan ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/us-will-fast-track-utah-uranium-mine-permit-2025-05-12/#:~:text=Wood%20project%2C%20situated%20on%20a,uranium%20production)).  

- **Aeromagnetic Surveys:**  Vanadium often occurs in titanomagnetite, which is strongly magnetic.  High-resolution aeromagnetic maps are therefore valuable for spotting layered mafic intrusions or skarn/metasomatic zones (Bushveld, Lac Tio, Pilbara analogs).  Magnetic highs can guide drill targeting for vanadium-rich magnetite magnetite bodies.  

- **Geochemical Sampling:**  Systematic surface sampling (soils, stream sediment, rock chips) analyzed by ICP-MS for multi-elements (V, Ti, Fe, Cr, Mn, etc.) can reveal subtle V anomalies.  In weathered terrains, analyzing leachates or clay fractions for vanadium and pathfinders (Al, Fe) helps delineate concealed ore. Modern tracing might use portable XRF or ICP methods.  

- **Geologic Mapping & Remote Sensing:**  Traditional geological mapping identifies potential host rocks (e.g. Permian/Triassic sandstones, syenitic intrusions, iron formations).  Satellite hyperspectral imagery and aerial photography can map ferric/oxide signatures and alteration minerals (e.g. kaolinite, epidote) that often accompany vanadiferous ore zones.  Known V provinces (Fennoscandian shield, Colorado Plateau, West Africa) provide analogues.  

- **Drilling Programs:**  Once targets are defined, standard RC or diamond drilling is used to define ore bodies.  Drill cores are logged and sampled, with assays for V₂O₅, U₃O₈, Fe, Ti content. Mineral identification (e.g. roscoelite or patronite in shales, magnetite lamellae in gabbro) is confirmed petrographically or by SEM/EDS.  These data are essential to convert an exploration target into a reported resource or reserve.  

## Key Extraction Technologies
- **Alkaline Roast–Leach:**  Widely used for titaniferous magnetite vanadium.  Finely ground ore is mixed with sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide and roasted (often at 800–900°C) to convert vanadium into water-soluble sodium metavanadate.  The roast product is then water-leached to dissolve vanadium, leaving an iron-rich residue.  This technique is used commercially in some Chinese and Australian processes, and forms the basis of the patented TIVAN process (TNG’s Mt Peake) and others ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)).  

- **Ironmaking/Smelting & Slag Processing:**  The traditional route is to smelt V-bearing magnetite to pig iron, generating a vanadium-rich slag (10–25% V₂O₅).  Steel mills (electric arc furnaces or basic oxygen furnaces) at plants like Rhovan (SA) and Evraz (Russia) produce such slag as a byproduct.  The slag is then crushed and leached (acidic or alkaline) to recover V₂O₅.  This integrated iron-vanadium route remains the largest source of V globally.  

- **Acid Leaching and Pressure Oxidation:**  For oxides or complex ores (including secondary materials like fly ash), sulfuric acid digestion can extract vanadium.  Often an oxidizer (O₂, H₂O₂) is added to increase dissolution.  Autoclave pressure leaching (180–240°C) is used in several Chinese plants for lower-grade material, sometimes in multi-stage circuits to remove impurities.  This hydrometallurgical path can treat ore that is not amenable to smelting, but requires careful effluent treatment for contaminants.  

- **Direct Reduction:**  Ferrovanadium alloys (35–85% V) are typically made by aluminothermic or carbothermic reduction of V₂O₅ in electric arc furnaces.  Aluminum or ferrosilicon is used as the reductant.  The molten alloy often goes to a vacuum degassing/refining stage to remove volatile impurities (e.g. sulphur, lead, arsenic).  For aerospace-grade vanadium metal, calcium reduction of V₂O₅ followed by vacuum distillation (Van Arkel–de Boer process) yields ultrapure V metal.  

- **Byproduct/Secondary Recovery:**  Many refineries and steel mills publicly or on pilot scale treat spent petroleum catalysts, fuel oil ash, and steelmaking dusts.  These wastes are roasted or leached: for example, oil refinery catalysts containing vanadium pass through a roasting step (to burn off organics) and then acid leach.  New methods reported in patents (e.g. chelating-organic acid leaches) claim >90% recovery of V from spent catalysts, enabling circular economy recycling.  

## Key Separation Technologies
- **Solvent Extraction (SX):**  After leach, vanadium is purified via solvent extraction.  Commercial extractants include organophosphorus acids (e.g. D2EHPA) and quaternary amines.  The process removes V away from impurities like iron, titanium, uranium.  For example, D2EHPA in kerosene can extract amavadine or decavanadate species from acidic solution; vanadium is later stripped with ammonia or sodium carbonate ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)).  Multi-stage counter-current SX units are common in vanadium plants.  

- **Ion Exchange:**  Anion exchange resins (strong-base) can selectively bind vanadate anions from solution.  The resin is then eluted with salt or alkaline solution to yield a concentrated V stream.  This method is used in some Chinese plants as an alternative to SX for final polishing, especially where low organics are required.  

- **pH-Driven Precipitation:**  Perhaps the most established purification step: adjusting pH to precipitate ammonium metavanadate (AMV).  Typically, ammonia is added to the vanadate solution at pH ≈ 8–9, forming fine AMV crystals.  These are filtered and calcined.  This step removes most remaining impurities and yields solid ammonium polyvanadate, which then converts to V₂O₅ on heating.  Controlled precipitation (and subsequent washing) is crucial for battery-grade purity.  

- **Crystallization/Electrowinning:**  In some cases, very pure vanadium(V) solutions are crystallized directly (to ammonium polyvanadate).  Alternatively, electrowinning can reduce V(V) to metallic vanadium or produce concentrated vanadium electrolytes.  For uranium co-recovery, faintly etched SX circuits allow separation of U and V (U remains as solvated complex, V transfers to the aqueous strip); battery-grade vanadium often uses electrowinning from alkaline vanadate solutions to achieve low impurity levels.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
- **Calcination to V₂O₅:**  Ammonium metavanadate (NH₄VO₃) decomposes at ~450–500°C to V₂O₅, releasing ammonia and water.  This controlled calcination (often in multiple steps) yields the commercial flaky V₂O₅ product (>99% purity).  Thorough washing of AMV and precise temperature control (to avoid sintering) are standard procedures in industry. 

- **Vacuum Distillation/Sublimation:**  For ultra-high purity V₂O₅ (e.g. >99.9% for battery electrolytes), batch sublimation under vacuum can separate trace impurities.  V₂O₅ has a vapor pressure at ~700°C; under high vacuum it sublimates and re-crystallizes on cooler surfaces, leaving behind less volatile contaminants.  This step is used by specialty producers to meet electronics or specialty battery-grade specs.

- **Ferrovanadium Production:**  High-grade V₂O₅ is converted to FeV (typically 35–60% V) by reducing with aluminum or ferrosilicon in electric furnaces.  The molten alloy is cast into ingots/crumbles.  Subsequent vacuum arc-remelting (VAR) or electron-beam refinements remove impurities (S, Pb, Bi) to meet rebar-spec or aerospace-spec V content.  FeNiV alloys (nickel-vanadium) can also be produced by co-reduction for niche applications.  

- **Vanadium Metal and Chemical Products:**  For aerospace alloys, pure vanadium metal is made via calcium thermal reduction of V₂O₅ or by the Van Arkel–de Boer iodide process (V volatilizes as VCl₄ and deposits as metal on hot filament).  Electrolytic processes exist: e.g., some companies electrolyze V sulfate/bisulfate in molten salt to produce high-purity V powder.  Vanadium chloride is produced when needed (as an intermediate in specialty routes).  

## Key Remediation Technologies
- **Chemical Precipitation:**  Process effluents containing dissolved vanadium (often as vanadate) are treated by raising pH with lime (Ca(OH)₂) or soda ash.  Vanadium precipitates as calcium vanadate or hydrated V bluish-green precipitates.  Proper pH control (usually pH 8–11) yields >95% removal efficiency.  The resulting sludge (mostly Ca–V compounds) can either be disposed or recycled via re-leaching.  

- **Adsorption & Ion-Exchange Filters:**  Dissolved V can also be removed by passing effluent through adsorption media.  Iron oxides/oxyhydroxides (e.g. goethite) strongly adsorb vanadate.  Activated carbon impregnated with metal oxide or commercial ion-exchange resins (strong-base anion resin) can lower V in water to <1 ppm.  For example, chelated iron oxide filters have been demonstrated in mine water treatment to capture vanadium efficiently.  

- **Phytoremediation:**  Certain plants (e.g. water hyacinth, Vetiver grass) have some ability to uptake vanadium from contaminated water or soils.  Wetland microcosms have shown promise: plants accumulate V in biomass which can be harvested.  However, V is not as strongly hyperaccumulated as some elements, so this is usually a polishing step.  (China’s Academy of Sciences has published studies on wetland removal of V from industrial effluents.)  

- **Advanced Oxidation:**  Some waste streams contain organo-vanadium complexes.  Fenton’s reagent (H₂O₂ + Fe²⁺) can break down organics and precipitate V, combining treatment and recovery.  Other processes (ozonation, photocatalysis) can convert soluble vanadates to less mobile forms.  These are mainly at trial stage for vanadium-specific remediation.

- **Waste Recycling:**  Spent materials (e.g. petroleum catalysts, fly ash, spent VRFB electrolytes) are increasingly recycled.  For example, spent V catalysts can be roasted to remove bound SO₄ or Mo, then leached (acid or alkali) to recover >90% of V ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/idemitsu-take-majority-stake-australian-vanadium-developer-vecco-2024-12-18/#:~:text=which%20includes%20a%20vanadium%20mine,2027%2C%20following%20a%20detailed%20feasibility)).  Spent VRFB electrolyte (VSO₄ solution) is typically purified by distillation or ion-exchange and reused, minimizing losses.  Steel slag and ash containing vanadium likewise can be reprocessed into new feed for recovery, turning a waste stream into a resource.
