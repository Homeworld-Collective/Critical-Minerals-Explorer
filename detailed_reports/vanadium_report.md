## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States (Active Producers):**  The only significant domestic vanadium sources are Energy Fuels Inc. and U.S. Vanadium.  Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill (Utah) is the sole conventional vanadium processing plant in the US.  Recent upgrades have enabled it to produce on the order of 150,000–200,000 pounds V₂O₅ per month (~870 t V₂O₅/yr, equivalent to ≈470 t V) from existing tailings ponds ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)).  U.S. Vanadium Holding Co. (Arkansas) recovers vanadium from recycled sources (petroleum/oil catalysts and steel scrap), yielding ultra-high-purity V₂O₅ and VRFB electrolyte ([usvanadium.com](https://usvanadium.com/u-s-vanadium-acquires-materials-processing-plant-in-arkansas-as-it-continues-to-ramp-up-production-of-made-in-usa-high-purity-vanadium-products/#:~:text=USV%20produces%20vanadium,to%20primary%20vanadium%20mining%20operations)).  Together these operations account for only a few hundred metric tons of V₂O₅ (and thus V) per year – far below US apparent demand (~14,000 t V in 2023 ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%2094,metric%20tons%20to%20over%2014%2C000))).  
• **Allied Nations:**  Canada, Australia, the EU, Norway, Iceland, and Japan currently have essentially **no primary vanadium mining or processing**.  No commercial vanadium mine exists in Canada or Europe today, and Japan/Norway have none.  A handful of exploration-stage projects (e.g. Australia’s Gabanintha, Finland’s Mustavaara) are under development, but have yet to produce. As a result, allied demand is met by imports (roughly 99% of global supply from China, Russia, S. Africa ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=However%2C%2099,stage%20exploration))). For example, Australian Vanadium Ltd’s Gabanintha PFS plans ~10,100 t V₂O₅/yr output (≈5,500 t V) once built ([www.australianmining.com.au](https://www.australianmining.com.au/australian-vanadiums-gabanintha-goes-ahead-with-10100ty-planned-production/#:~:text=Australian%20Vanadium%E2%80%99s%20pre,5%7D%29%20per%20year)), but none of these domestic sources are online today.  (Current “2 US mines, 93,600 t/yr” likely includes byproduct/upgraded scrap estimates; official USGS figures show domestic mined V is only on the order of hundreds of tons ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)) ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=However%2C%2099,stage%20exploration)).)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Steel and Alloying:**  Historically ~90+% of vanadium goes into high-strength steel (rebar, automotive, aerospace). U.S. demand in 2023 was ~14,000 t V ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%2094,metric%20tons%20to%20over%2014%2C000)) (94% in steel ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=With%20steel%20still%20dominating%20vanadium,put%20significant%20pressure%20on%20supply))), having grown ~40% since 2019.  Demand in the US and EU will rise with infrastructure, automotive light-weighting, and stricter rebar standards.  For example, anticipated Chinese rebar codes imply higher V usage in global steel, with similar trends in advanced economies.  Assuming modest growth, U.S. vanadium demand alone could approach **20,000–25,000 t V by 2030** (steel + alloys). Europe’s steel gap suggests allied consumption on the order of **8,000–12,000 t V** by 2030, and Japan perhaps **3,000–5,000 t V**, excluding batteries.  (US industry notes “most U.S. V consumption still tied to steel alloying” ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%2094,metric%20tons%20to%20over%2014%2C000)) ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=With%20steel%20still%20dominating%20vanadium,put%20significant%20pressure%20on%20supply)).)  
• **Energy Storage:**  Stationary VRFB deployments will add to 2030 demand. World Bank analysis projects ~111 GWh cumulative VRFB energy storage by 2030 ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=The%20cumulative%20global%20demand%20of,a%20World%20Bank%20Group%20report)) (roughly 27 GWh/yr by 2030).  At ~15 kg V/kWh, that implies on the order of **80,000–120,000 t V** of total VRFB vanadium globally by 2030.  While most VRFB growth is expected in China ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=The%20cumulative%20global%20demand%20of,a%20World%20Bank%20Group%20report)), allies are active too (e.g. Japan’s Sumitomo deployed 51 MWh in Hokkaido ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=,storage%20project%20in%20Alberta)); Texas has >48 MWh scheduled with Largo energy).  U.S. and allied VRFB capacity by 2030 could easily consume several thousand tons of V₂O₅ (several thousand t V) annually.  
• **Total Outlook:**  In sum, by 2030 **U.S.+allied demand may approach tens of thousands of metric tons of V**.  Industry analysts see global vanadium demand ~110,000 t V in 2022 doubling by ~2032 ([www.crugroup.com](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2022/battery-demand-for-vanadium-from-vrfb-to-change-vanadium-market#:~:text=The%20cumulative%20share%20of%20energy,change%20the%20complexion%20of%20the)).  If global demand is ~200–220 kt by 2030, US+allies (say 10–15% of world) might require **40–60 kt V** by 2030.  The bulk is for steel/alloys, with a rapidly growing share for batteries ([www.crugroup.com](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2022/battery-demand-for-vanadium-from-vrfb-to-change-vanadium-market#:~:text=The%20cumulative%20share%20of%20energy,change%20the%20complexion%20of%20the)) ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=With%20steel%20still%20dominating%20vanadium,put%20significant%20pressure%20on%20supply)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:**  Domestic output may rise modestly if current projects advance. Energy Fuels has several idle uranium-vanadium mines (Pandora, La Sal, Whirlwind, Rim) that could feed White Mesa when prices justify. The mill can flex production (already ~870 t V₂O₅/yr) without new mining ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)). U.S. Vanadium’s new Arkansas roasting plant (Benton) expands capacity to grind and treat recycled feed ([usvanadium.com](https://usvanadium.com/u-s-vanadium-acquires-materials-processing-plant-in-arkansas-as-it-continues-to-ramp-up-production-of-made-in-usa-high-purity-vanadium-products/#:~:text=USV%20produces%20vanadium,to%20primary%20vanadium%20mining%20operations)). By 2030, aggressive restart of standby mines combined with full-scale recycling could boost U.S. supply to perhaps **2,000–5,000 t V**/yr (V₂O₅ basis), but still only a fraction of demand.  
• **Australia:**  Key projects will shape supply.  Australian Vanadium’s Gabanintha (WA) aims for 10,100 t V₂O₅/yr ([www.australianmining.com.au](https://www.australianmining.com.au/australian-vanadiums-gabanintha-goes-ahead-with-10100ty-planned-production/#:~:text=Australian%20Vanadium%E2%80%99s%20pre,5%7D%29%20per%20year)) (~5,500 t V) with first production planned mid-2030s.  TNG’s Mt Peake (NT) targets vanadium from titanomagnetite and ore (~7–8% V₂O₅) via its patented TIVAN process.  Kameron (QLD) and others also plan vanadium from magnetite.  If Gabanintha and similar projects enter production by 2030, Australia could add **5,000–10,000 t V**/yr.  
• **Canada:**  No current production. Several exploration-stage projects exist (e.g. Ontario’s Lac Doré, Devonian shale plays), but none will feed 2030 production.  Practically **0 t** domestically.  
• **Europe/Norway:**  The Mustavaara (Finland) Ni-V deposit is being permitted; if restarted, it could produce ~~500 t V/yr by mid-2030s. Norway’s old Fensfjord vanadium mine is inactive.  2030 EU/Norway production likely **≪500 t**.  
• **Japan/Iceland:**  No vanadium mines; Zero output. Japan will rely entirely on imports (e.g. from Taranto slag or ferrovanadium alloy) to meet even small VRFB and industrial needs.  

## References for volumes  
• **US Production:** White Mesa Mill has recovered several million pounds of V₂O₅ historically, currently ~150–225k lb/month ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)).  These figures imply ~870 t V₂O₅/yr (≈470 t V) without new mining. U.S. Vanadium’s output (scrap-recycle) isn’t public, but active projects are documented ([usvanadium.com](https://usvanadium.com/u-s-vanadium-acquires-materials-processing-plant-in-arkansas-as-it-continues-to-ramp-up-production-of-made-in-usa-high-purity-vanadium-products/#:~:text=USV%20produces%20vanadium,to%20primary%20vanadium%20mining%20operations)).  
• **Allied Production:** AVL’s PFS gives 10,100 t V₂O₅/yr for Gabanintha ([www.australianmining.com.au](https://www.australianmining.com.au/australian-vanadiums-gabanintha-goes-ahead-with-10100ty-planned-production/#:~:text=Australian%20Vanadium%E2%80%99s%20pre,5%7D%29%20per%20year)); Japan/EU have no operational plants.  Projected supplies come from company reports and PFS documents.  
• **US Demand (2023):** ~14,000 t V (from 2019–2023 growth data) ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%2094,metric%20tons%20to%20over%2014%2C000)).  USGS and industry sources confirm steel alloying dominates (~94% of V use) ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=With%20steel%20still%20dominating%20vanadium,put%20significant%20pressure%20on%20supply)).  
• **Global Demand Forecast:** CRU (U.S. Ferroalloys conf.) estimates ~110 kt V demand in 2022 doubling by 2032 ([www.crugroup.com](https://www.crugroup.com/en/communities/thought-leadership/2022/battery-demand-for-vanadium-from-vrfb-to-change-vanadium-market#:~:text=The%20cumulative%20share%20of%20energy,change%20the%20complexion%20of%20the)).  World Bank/Vanitec projects ~111 GWh VRFB by 2030 ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=The%20cumulative%20global%20demand%20of,a%20World%20Bank%20Group%20report)). Market reports indicate global supply must grow ~6.9%/yr to 2030 ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=significant%20pressure%20on%20supply)).  
• **Allied Demand:** Estimated from steel/VRFB usage.  Japan’s Sumitomo (51 MWh) and others imply multi-kilotons use ([min-met.com](https://min-met.com/blog/vanadium-use-steel-still-dominates-but-batteries-rising/#:~:text=,storage%20project%20in%20Alberta)).  EU steel forecasts imply several kilotons V.  
• **Projected Supply (2030):** Based on company studies (e.g. Gabanintha PFS ([www.australianmining.com.au](https://www.australianmining.com.au/australian-vanadiums-gabanintha-goes-ahead-with-10100ty-planned-production/#:~:text=Australian%20Vanadium%E2%80%99s%20pre,5%7D%29%20per%20year))) and insider estimates (Energy Fuels, etc.). These are discussed in Mining Journal/press releases. 

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Many V deposits contain U/Th. Airborne or ground gamma-ray surveys can flag U anomalies that often coincide with vanadium ores (e.g. carnotite).  The Arkansas Wilson Springs vanadium deposit was originally discovered by anomalous radioactivity ([encyclopediaofarkansas.net](https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/vanadium-mining-5915/#:~:text=The%20discovery%20of%20anomalous%20radioactivity,niobium%20at%20nearby%20Magnet%20Cove)).  
• **Aeromagnetic Surveys:** Titanium-rich magnetite (common V host) produces strong magnetic highs. Airborne magnetics map layered intrusions or skarns carrying vanadiferous titanomagnetite (analogous to South African Bushveld or Australia’s Gabanintha), guiding drill targets.  
• **Geochemistry:** Systematic soil/stream/rock sampling for V and indicator elements (Ti, Fe, Mn, V) identifies “footprints” of buried vanadium ore. For instance, multi-element assays of uranium-prospect samples at Potash Springs revealed vanadium and niobium content ([encyclopediaofarkansas.net](https://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/entries/vanadium-mining-5915/#:~:text=The%20discovery%20of%20anomalous%20radioactivity,niobium%20at%20nearby%20Magnet%20Cove)).  
• **Geologic Mapping & Remote Sensing:** Mapping of vanadium-host rocks (uraniferous sandstones, mafic intrusions, skarns) defines target areas. Satellite/hyperspectral imaging to detect iron oxides or clays (e.g. goethite from oxidized V) can also aid discovery. Known vanadium provinces (Colorado Plateau, Fennoscandia, the Pilbara) guide where to look.  
• **Drilling (RC/diamond):** After identifying anomalies, express drilling is used. Core geochemistry and mineralogy (e.g. of titaniferous magnetite or vanadate minerals) confirm grade.  This is essential for resource delineation in both US (e.g. Energy Fuels’ La Sal) and allied projects.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Alkaline Roast–Leach:** A common route for titaniferous magnetite. The iron-Ti ore concentrate is roasted with Na₂CO₃ or CaO at ∼800–900°C, converting V₂O₅ into soluble sodium/calcium vanadates.  The calcine is then water-leached to dissolve V.  This process (often called the “Soda Roast”) is used on vanadium slag from steel furnaces.  
• **Smelting/Slag Processing:** Traditional major pathway. Magnetite concentrate is smelted in a blast furnace to pig iron; a high-vanadium slag (∼10–15% V₂O₅) is produced by oxygen blowing of the melt ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279602010_Extractive_metallurgy_of_vanadium-containing_titaniferous_magnetite_ores_A_review#:~:text=review%20www,which%20is%20a%20product%20for)).  The slag is then ground and leached (acid or alkali) to extract vanadium.  (For example, Evraz’s Ontario Works plant uses such a converter process.)  
• **Acid Leaching & Pressure Oxidation:** Vanadium ores or slag can be digested in sulfuric acid, often at elevated T/P.  Pressure leach autoclaves (with added oxidants like H₂O₂) can dissolve V from refractory materials or spent catalysts.  This hydrometallurgical approach is widely studied for low-grade or secondary sources.  
• **Direct Reduction (Carbothermic):** Electrified furnaces can reduce V-bearing oxides with coke/ferrosilicon to produce ferrovanadium alloy in-situ.  High-temperature vacuum or plasma processes yield vanadium-rich metal directly (though energy-intensive).  
• **Byproduct Recovery (Catalysts, etc.):** Spent petroleum catalysts and steelmaking dusts are treated chemically.  Organo-vanadium chemicals (spent SCR catalysts) undergo oxidative acid leach (e.g. sulfuric/H₂O₂) followed by precipitation.  Recent research (ACS Omega) shows combined H₂SO₄/oxalate leaching recovers V efficiently ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.3c08452#:~:text=Acid%2FOxalic%20Acid%20Combined%20Solvent%20,Leaching%20Vanadium%20from)).  Another study used Fenton’s reagent (Fe²⁺/H₂O₂) to oxidize organics, then alkaline leach for V recovery ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/7/2021#:~:text=Efficient%20Multi,Using%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Approach)).  These allow remediation of wastes while producing V feedstock.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** After leaching, V is purified by organic SX.  Quaternary amines or ketoxime/phosphoric acid reagents selectively extract vanadate ions from the pregnant solution, leaving Fe, Ti and other impurities behind. Subsequent stripping yields a concentrated V solution.  SX is used in commercial vanadium plants to upgrade V₂O₅ purity.  
• **Ion Exchange:** Anion-exchange resins (e.g. strongly basic quaternary amine resins) can capture exposed vanadate ions (VO₃⁻, VO₂⁺). Loaded resin is eluted with salt/ammonia to produce a cleaner V liquor.  This technique provides finer separation of V from co-leached metals.  
• **pH-Driven Precipitation:** Vanadium is precipitated by pH adjustment. For example, raising pH to ~9–10 with ammonium hydroxide forms insoluble ammonium metavanadate (NH₄VO₃), which can be filtered and calcined.  At U.S. Vanadium and White Mesa, controlled precipitation/crystallization is used to isolate very pure V₂O₅ (White Mesa reports 99.6% V₂O₅ purity ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the))).  
• **Crystallization/Electrowinning:** In specialty cases, V can be crystallized directly (cooling a vanadate solution yields fine V₂O₅ crystals) or electrorefined (molten vanadium salts electrolysis) to achieve battery-grade purity.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Calcination to V₂O₅:** Ammonium metavanadate (NH₄VO₃) from precipitation is heated (∼500–600°C) to decompose into vanadium pentoxide (V₂O₅) flakes.  This yields a marketable oxide used for catalysts and alloys.  Careful calcination conditions (e.g. oxidizing atmosphere) achieve >99% V₂O₅. White Mesa’s “high-purity” V₂O₅ is produced this way ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)).  
• **Vacuum Distillation/Sublimation:** For ultra-high-purity V₂O₅ (battery-grade), sublimation under vacuum can separate impurities.  V₂O₅ sublimes at ∼690°C; impurities typically remain in residue.  This laboratory/industrial refinement can boost purity toward 99.9+%.  
• **Ferrovanadium Alloying:** Industrial steel use often requires ferrovanadium (FeV).  Purified V₂O₅ or V₂O₃ is mixed with scrap iron/steel and ferrosilicon in an electric arc or vacuum furnace.  High heat reduces V₂O₅ to metallic V, which dissolves in iron to form FeV alloy (common grades 35–85% V).  Final “refinement” includes slag skimming and vacuum degassing to meet spec (e.g. low C, P, S).  
• **Metal & Chemical Refinement:** Ductile vanadium metal (for aerospace) can be obtained by hydrogenation–dehydrogenation (vanadium hydride route) or electron beam melting of V sponge to remove residuals.  Alternatively, V₂O₅ can be converted to vanadium trichloride or oxide, reduced with aluminum or Zn, yielding high-purity V. Advanced methods (e.g. formic acid reduction of VCl₄) are under development for specialty V metal.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Chemical Precipitation:** Contaminated water (e.g. mine runoff) is treated by dose of lime or NaOH, raising pH to precipitate vanadium as hydroxide/carbonate solids.  This immoblizes V in tailings while clarifying effluent.  Similar to uranium/selenium treatment methods.  
• **Adsorption & Ion-Exchange Filters:** Vanadium in solution (as vanadate) can be captured using adsorbents (iron/manganese oxides, activated alumina) or strong-base anion-exchange resin columns.  Passing water through such media removes V, which is later eluted or the media is regenerated.  This is used for treating processing plant bleedwaters.  
• **Phytoremediation:** Certain plants and algae uptake V from soil/water.  Studies have shown aquatic and emergent macrophytes in V-mining sites can accumulate significant V levels ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-018-3069-9#:~:text=Effective%20phytoremediation%20of%20low,Cite%20this%20article%20Environmental%20Science)).  For example, native Chinese wetland plants removed low-level V from contaminated water, an eco-friendly clean-up approach.  
• **Advanced Oxidation (Fenton):** For organic-rich wastes (e.g. spent catalysts/sludge), Fenton’s reagent (H₂O₂+Fe²⁺) oxidizes organics, releasing vanadium into solution.  Subsequent alkaline leach recovers V ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/7/2021#:~:text=Efficient%20Multi,Using%20Deep%20Reinforcement%20Learning%20Approach)).  This method “remediates” organic waste while extracting V.  
• **Catalyst Recycling:** Spent vanadium catalysts (from oil refineries or SCR units) are effectively a vanadium-laden waste.  Recycling processes (acid leach, roasting, or bioleaching) recover vanadium and detoxify the residue.  New combined techniques (e.g. H₂SO₄/oxalic acid leaching ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.3c08452#:~:text=Download%20Hi,9294))) are being deployed to reclaim V and eliminate a disposal hazard.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Processing Infrastructure:** The critical bottleneck is a lack of large-scale hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical plants outside established suppliers.  No U.S. or allied facilities currently exist that can roast and leach titanomagnetite ore at commercial scale, nor produce ferrovanadium in vacuum furnaces.  For example, White Mesa can recover pond vanadium cheaply ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)), but building a new 100,000 t/yr roast–leach plant would cost ~$0.5B ([www.australianmining.com.au](https://www.australianmining.com.au/australian-vanadiums-gabanintha-goes-ahead-with-10100ty-planned-production/#:~:text=Australian%20Vanadium%E2%80%99s%20pre,5%7D%29%20per%20year)). Without these capital‐intensive facilities, domestic feedstock (even if mined) cannot be converted profitably.  
• **Ore Grade and Mineralogy:** Many US/allied deposits are lower grade or refractory (e.g. disseminated V in sandstone or titanomagnetite), requiring complex chemistry.  Technologies exist (acid/alkali leach), but scale-up hurdles remain.  There is no “plug-and-play” method to cheaply extract V from such ores, unlike bauxite-to-Al or iron-to-steel.  
• **Purification Capacity:** Producing battery-grade vanadium demands multi-step purification (precipitation/calcination, purer crystals).  Few Western plants have that expertise.  For instance, Energy Fuels had to develop “innovative” pond-processing to reach 99.6% V₂O₅ ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)). Allied nations would need similar advances in refining tech, which are not yet deployed.  
• **Environmental and Regulatory:** Vanadium extraction from novel ores would generate tailings with U or heavy metals.  Advanced remediation tech (like those above) are needed, but permit delays and compliance costs slow project development.  

**Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences):**  The paramount bottleneck is **processing capacity**.  Although deposits exist in western-aligned countries, there are virtually no domestic plants to turn those ores into market-ready product.  Addressing vanadium demand thus hinges on deploying capital-intensive roast–leach and refining facilities (to produce V₂O₅ or FeV), technologies currently limited to China, Russia and S. Africa ([www.energyfuels.com](https://www.energyfuels.com/2019-04-01-Energy-Fuels-Provides-Update-on-Vanadium-Production#:~:text=As%20previously%20reported%2C%20the%20Company,basis%2C%20which%20would%20exceed%20the)) ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/energy-transition/mining/vanadium-double-edged-demand/#:~:text=However%2C%2099,stage%20exploration)). Until allied producers can field these extraction/refinement infrastructures, production cannot scale to meet growing demand.
