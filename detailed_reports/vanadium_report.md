## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Processing infrastructure; ore beneficiation; purification capacity; environmental compliance*

• **Processing Infrastructure:** The critical bottleneck is a lack of large-scale hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical plants outside established suppliers. No U.S. or allied facilities currently exist that can roast and leach titanomagnetite ore at commercial scale, nor produce ferrovanadium in vacuum furnaces. For example, White Mesa can recover vanadium from existing tailings ponds, but building a new commercial-scale roast-leach plant would require significant capital investment. Without these capital-intensive facilities, domestic feedstock (even if mined) cannot be converted profitably.

• **Ore Grade and Mineralogy:** Many US/allied deposits are lower grade or refractory (e.g., disseminated V in sandstone or titanomagnetite), requiring complex chemistry. Technologies exist (acid/alkali leach), but scale-up hurdles remain. There is no standardized method to economically extract V from such ores, unlike established processes for bauxite-to-aluminum or iron ore-to-steel.

• **Purification Capacity:** Producing battery-grade vanadium demands multi-step purification (precipitation/calcination, recrystallization). Few Western plants have this expertise. For instance, Energy Fuels developed specialized pond-processing techniques to achieve high-purity V₂O₅. Allied nations would need similar advances in refining technology, which are not yet widely deployed.

• **Environmental and Regulatory:** Vanadium extraction from uranium-bearing ores generates tailings with radioactive materials and heavy metals. Advanced remediation technologies are needed, but permit delays and compliance costs slow project development.

**Key Bottleneck Summary:** The paramount bottleneck is **processing capacity**. Although deposits exist in Western-aligned countries, there are virtually no domestic plants to convert ores into market-ready products. Addressing vanadium demand requires deploying capital-intensive roast-leach and refining facilities to produce V₂O₅ or ferrovanadium, technologies currently concentrated in China, Russia, South Africa, and Brazil. Until allied producers can establish these extraction and refinement infrastructures, production cannot scale to meet growing demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: US ~500-1,000 tons V/year; Allies ~0 tons V/year*

• **United States (Active Producers):** The primary domestic vanadium sources are Energy Fuels Inc. and U.S. Vanadium. Energy Fuels' White Mesa Mill (Utah) is the sole conventional vanadium processing plant in the US. Current production from existing tailings ponds yields approximately 1,800-2,400 tons V₂O₅ per year (equivalent to ~1,000-1,350 tons V). U.S. Vanadium Holding Co. (Hot Springs, Arkansas) recovers vanadium from recycled sources (petroleum/oil catalysts and steel scrap), producing ultra-high-purity V₂O₅ and vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) electrolyte. Together these operations account for approximately 1,000-2,000 metric tons of V per year – far below US apparent consumption of ~14,000 tons V in 2023.

• **Allied Nations:** Canada, Australia, the EU, Norway, Iceland, and Japan currently have essentially **no primary vanadium mining or processing**. No commercial vanadium mine operates in Canada or Europe today, and Japan/Norway have none. Several exploration-stage projects (e.g., Australia's Gabanintha, Finland's Mustavaara) are under development but have yet to produce. As a result, allied demand is met almost entirely by imports, with global supply dominated by China (~40%), Russia (~20%), South Africa (~20%), and Brazil (~15%). For example, Australian Vanadium Ltd's Gabanintha project targets ~10,100 tons V₂O₅/year output (~5,650 tons V) with production potentially beginning in the late 2020s, but no allied domestic sources are online today.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: US ~20,000-25,000 tons V; Allies ~15,000-25,000 tons V; Total ~35,000-50,000 tons V*

• **Steel and Alloying:** Historically ~90% of vanadium goes into high-strength steel (rebar, automotive, aerospace). U.S. demand in 2023 was ~14,000 tons V (with 94% used in steel), having grown approximately 40% since 2019. Demand in the US and EU will rise with infrastructure investment, automotive lightweighting, and stricter rebar standards. Chinese rebar code changes requiring higher vanadium content may influence global standards. Assuming modest growth of 5-7% annually, U.S. vanadium demand alone could reach **20,000-25,000 tons V by 2030** (steel + alloys). European consumption could reach **10,000-15,000 tons V** by 2030, and Japan perhaps **3,000-5,000 tons V**, excluding battery applications.

• **Energy Storage:** Stationary VRFB deployments will significantly add to 2030 demand. World Bank analysis projects ~111 GWh cumulative VRFB energy storage by 2030. At typical loading of 20-40 kg V/kWh, this implies **2,000-4,500 tons V** of annual VRFB vanadium demand globally by 2030. While most VRFB growth is expected in China, allied nations are increasingly active (e.g., Japan's Sumitomo deployed 51 MWh in Hokkaido; projects planned in Texas, California, and Alberta). U.S. and allied VRFB capacity by 2030 could consume 1,000-2,000 tons V annually.

• **Total Outlook:** By 2030, **U.S. + allied demand may reach 35,000-50,000 metric tons of V**. Industry analysts project global vanadium demand of ~110,000 tons V in 2022 potentially doubling to ~200,000-220,000 tons by 2032. The bulk remains for steel/alloys, with a rapidly growing share for batteries and chemical applications.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: US ~2,000-5,000 tons V; Australia ~5,000-10,000 tons V; Others <1,000 tons V; Total ~7,000-16,000 tons V*

• **United States:** Domestic output may rise modestly if current projects advance. Energy Fuels has several idle uranium-vanadium mines (Pandora, La Sal, Whirlwind, Rim) that could feed White Mesa Mill when prices justify restart. The mill can potentially increase production from current levels without new mining. U.S. Vanadium's expanded Arkansas facility increases capacity to process recycled feed. By 2030, aggressive restart of standby mines combined with full-scale recycling could boost U.S. supply to **2,000-5,000 tons V/year**, still only 10-25% of projected demand.

• **Australia:** Key projects will shape supply. Australian Vanadium's Gabanintha (Western Australia) targets 10,100 tons V₂O₅/year (~5,650 tons V) with first production potentially in late 2020s. TNG's Mount Peake (Northern Territory) plans vanadium recovery from titanomagnetite via its TIVAN process. Technology Metals Australia's Yarrabubba project and other magnetite projects are also in development. If Gabanintha and similar projects enter production by 2030, Australia could add **5,000-10,000 tons V/year**.

• **Canada:** No current production exists. Several exploration-stage projects (e.g., Lac Doré vanadium-titanium project in Quebec) are in early development, but none are likely to reach production by 2030. Output remains at **0 tons** domestically.

• **Europe/Norway:** The Mustavaara project (Finland) is seeking permits for potential restart. If developed, it might produce several hundred tons V/year by early 2030s. Norway's historical vanadium resources remain undeveloped. 2030 EU/Norway production likely **<500 tons V**.

• **Japan/Iceland:** No vanadium mines exist; zero output projected. Japan will continue relying entirely on imports to meet VRFB and industrial needs.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Radiometric surveys; aeromagnetic surveys; geochemical sampling; geological mapping; drilling programs*

• **Radiometric Surveys:** Many vanadium deposits contain uranium/thorium. Airborne or ground gamma-ray surveys identify radioactive anomalies that often coincide with vanadium ores (e.g., carnotite). Historical discoveries in Arkansas and Colorado Plateau utilized radiometric methods.

• **Aeromagnetic Surveys:** Titanium-rich magnetite (common V host) produces strong magnetic anomalies. Airborne magnetics map layered intrusions or skarns containing vanadiferous titanomagnetite (analogous to South African Bushveld or Australia's Gabanintha), guiding drill targets.

• **Geochemistry:** Systematic soil/stream sediment/rock chip sampling for V and pathfinder elements (Ti, Fe, Mn, Cr) identifies geochemical halos around buried vanadium ore. Multi-element ICP-MS analysis reveals vanadium enrichment patterns.

• **Geologic Mapping & Remote Sensing:** Mapping of vanadium-host rocks (uraniferous sandstones, mafic intrusions, black shales) defines target areas. Satellite hyperspectral imaging detects iron oxides or clay alteration associated with vanadium mineralization. Known vanadium provinces (Colorado Plateau, Fennoscandian Shield, Pilbara Craton) guide exploration.

• **Drilling (RC/Diamond):** After identifying anomalies, reverse circulation and diamond drilling confirm mineralization. Core analysis for mineralogy (e.g., roscoelite, carnotite, magnetite) and assaying establish resource grades. This is essential for resource definition in both US and allied projects.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Alkaline roast-leach; smelting/slag processing; acid leaching; direct reduction; byproduct recovery*

• **Alkaline Roast-Leach:** Common route for titaniferous magnetite concentrates. Ore is roasted with sodium carbonate at 800-900°C, converting vanadium to soluble sodium vanadate. Water leaching dissolves vanadium for subsequent recovery. This process is used commercially for vanadium slag processing.

• **Smelting/Slag Processing:** Traditional major pathway where magnetite concentrate is smelted to produce pig iron and vanadium-rich slag (10-25% V₂O₅). The slag undergoes grinding and leaching (acid or alkaline) to extract vanadium. This integrated steel-vanadium production model dominates in China and Russia.

• **Acid Leaching & Pressure Oxidation:** Vanadium ores or secondary materials are digested in sulfuric acid, often at elevated temperature/pressure. Pressure oxidation autoclaves with oxidants (oxygen, hydrogen peroxide) enhance vanadium dissolution from refractory materials. This hydrometallurgical approach suits low-grade or complex ores.

• **Direct Reduction:** Electric arc furnaces reduce vanadium-bearing materials with carbon or ferrosilicon to produce ferrovanadium alloy directly. Aluminothermic reduction of V₂O₅ yields vanadium metal for aerospace applications.

• **Byproduct Recovery:** Spent petroleum refinery catalysts, fly ash, and steelmaking dusts undergo chemical treatment. Recent advances include combined acid/chelating agent leaching for enhanced recovery from spent catalysts, enabling circular economy approaches.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion exchange; pH precipitation; crystallization; membrane separation*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** After leaching, vanadium is purified using organic extractants. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) or quaternary ammonium compounds selectively extract vanadium from pregnant solutions, leaving impurities behind. Stripping with ammonia or sodium carbonate yields concentrated vanadium solution.

• **Ion Exchange:** Strong-base anion exchange resins capture vanadate ions from solution. Selective elution with ammonium or sodium salts produces purified vanadium streams. This technique enables fine separation from co-dissolved metals like uranium and molybdenum.

• **pH-Driven Precipitation:** Controlled pH adjustment precipitates vanadium compounds. Adding ammonia to pH 8-9 forms ammonium metavanadate (AMV), which is filtered and calcined to V₂O₅. This remains the dominant commercial purification method.

• **Crystallization/Electrowinning:** Cooling concentrated vanadate solutions yields high-purity crystals. Electrowinning from vanadium electrolytes produces metallic vanadium or concentrated solutions for VRFB applications.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Calcination to V₂O₅; vacuum refining; ferrovanadium production; chemical conversion; ultra-purification*

• **Calcination to V₂O₅:** Ammonium metavanadate decomposes at 450-500°C to form V₂O₅ flakes. Careful temperature control and oxidizing atmosphere achieve >99% purity. This standard process produces commercial-grade vanadium pentoxide.

• **Vacuum Distillation/Sublimation:** For ultra-high-purity V₂O₅ (>99.9% for batteries), controlled sublimation separates trace impurities. V₂O₅ melts at 690°C and can be purified through controlled vaporization and condensation.

• **Ferrovanadium Alloying:** V₂O₅ is reduced with aluminum or ferrosilicon in electric arc furnaces to produce ferrovanadium (35-85% V content). Vacuum refining removes volatile impurities to meet steel industry specifications.

• **Metal & Chemical Refinement:** High-purity vanadium metal for aerospace uses electron beam melting or the Van Arkel-de Boer process. Chemical routes include calcium reduction of V₂O₅ or electrolytic refining of vanadium salts.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Chemical precipitation; adsorption systems; phytoremediation; oxidation processes; waste recycling*

• **Chemical Precipitation:** Mine water and process effluents are treated with lime or caustic soda to precipitate vanadium as hydroxides or vanadates at pH 8-10. This immobilizes vanadium in stable compounds for disposal or recovery.

• **Adsorption & Ion-Exchange Filters:** Iron oxide adsorbents, activated carbon, or ion exchange resins remove dissolved vanadium from water streams. These systems achieve discharge limits <1 mg/L V in treated water.

• **Phytoremediation:** Wetland plants and hyperaccumulators uptake vanadium from contaminated soils and water. Chinese studies demonstrate effective removal using native wetland species in constructed treatment systems.

• **Advanced Oxidation:** Fenton's reagent (Fe²⁺/H₂O₂) breaks down organic-vanadium complexes in waste streams, enabling subsequent vanadium recovery. This dual remediation-recovery approach treats hazardous wastes while reclaiming valuable vanadium.

• **Catalyst Recycling:** Spent catalysts from oil refining and power plants undergo controlled roasting and leaching to recover vanadium while detoxifying residues. New hydrometallurgical processes achieve >95% vanadium recovery from these waste streams.
