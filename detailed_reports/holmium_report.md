## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
• **USA (Mountain Pass):** MP Materials’ Mountain Pass, CA mine is the only active U.S. rare-earth mine. It produced **42,499 MT** of rare‐earth oxide (mixed REO concentrate) in 2022 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=,5)) – a record high for the U.S.  This bulk concentrates mostly light REEs, with heavy lanthanides (including Ho) barely a few percent.  (The given context estimates current US Ho output ~3,425 MT/yr, implying <0.1% of MP concentrate, consistent with HREE-lean bastnäsite ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=REE%3B%20while%20terbium%2C%20dysprosium%2C%20holmium%2C,minerals%20in%20which%20LREE%20dominate)) ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=,5)).)  MP’s Stage II expansion is ongoing, but heavy REE (Ho) processing is only at engineering stage ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Increased%20production%202%25%20year,lead%20procurement)).  
• **Canada (Nechalacho):**  Cheetah Resources/Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (Thor Lake, NWT) began shipping REE concentrate in 2022 (≈5,000 t/yr initially ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/significant-day-for-the-north-nechalacho-s-first-rare-minerals-shipment-leaves-hay-river-1.6428596#:~:text=,transportation%20hub%20for%20the%20North))).  The project’s feasibility envisions up to **9,286 MT**/yr of total rare‐earth oxides (REEO) extracted ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/nechalacho-rare-earth-elements-project-thor-lake-northwest-territories/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20estimated%20to,mine%20life%20of%2020%20years)), including both LREE and HREE.  By 2025 production is expected to reach **25,000 t/yr** of REE‐rich concentrate ([www.mromagazine.com](https://www.mromagazine.com/2022/05/23/first-canadian-rare-earth-mine-starts-shipping-concentrate-from-n-w-t/#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20Nechalacho%20hopes%20to,decades%20to%20come%2C%20Connelly%20said)), with downstream separation to follow (some processing already in Saskatchewan and Norway).  
• **Australia (Mount Weld/Lynas):**  Lynas Corp’s Mt Weld mine in Western Australia shipped rare-earth ore to its Kuantan, Malaysia refinery.  For FY2023–24 Lynas produced **10,908 MT** of separated RE oxides ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)) (mostly Nd/Pr, Ce/La), with heavy REEs as minor coproducts.  Lynas is expanding capacity: a new Kalgoorlie processing plant (Phase 1 dewatering complete in Q2 2024, Phase 2 by 2025) will boost concentrate output ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20paid%20A%24579,projects%20at%20its%20Malaysian%20plant)).  Current Ho share in Lynas’ mix is small.  
• **EU (incl. Greenland):**  No active REE mine in EU.  Planned Greenland Kvanefjeld (Denmark) is the one large deposit: it holds ~**6.6 Mt** of rare-earth oxides (with substantial heavy lanthanides) ([rawmaterials.net](https://rawmaterials.net/greenlands-rare-earths-promising-but-challenging/#:~:text=Since%20then%2C%20the%20project%20has,a%20shift%20in%20Greenlandic%20politics)), but development is on hold (Greenland has banned U/Th mining ([rawmaterials.net](https://rawmaterials.net/greenlands-rare-earths-promising-but-challenging/#:~:text=Since%20then%2C%20the%20project%20has,a%20shift%20in%20Greenlandic%20politics))).  The EU currently relies ~100% on imports (mainly from Australia/USA/Japan).  
• **Norway/Iceland:** No REE mining. Research into geothermal or marginal sources is at R&D stage only.  
• **Japan:** No primary REE ore or oxide production; Japan imports all REEs. Domestic activities focus on recycling of magnets and specialized separation.  (Japan’s downstream magnet and electronics industries create Ho demand, but supply is imported.)

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
• **Global REE Demand Growth:**  CRU forecasts total RE oxide demand rising from ~186,000 MT in 2022 to ≈250,000 MT by 2030 (≈4.1% CAGR) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=The%20aggregate%20global%20market%20for,in%20demand%20for%20NdPr%20magnets)).  NdPr (for magnets) is growing fastest (~8.6% CAGR) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=growth%20rate%20,in%20demand%20for%20NdPr%20magnets)).  If Holmium oxide is ~1–2% of the REO basket, global Ho demand would be a few thousand tonnes by 2030.  US/allies share (roughly 25–30% of global) implies on the order of **hundreds to ~1,000 MT** of Ho demand in 2030, driven by new technologies.  
• **Clean-Energy/Auto (Magnets):** Rapid EV and wind-turbine growth drives NdFeB magnet demand (and its HREE dopants).  Nechalacho material is earmarked for EV motors – e.g. Nechalacho concentrate is being processed in Norway into alloys destined for European EV drivetrains ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/significant-day-for-the-north-nechalacho-s-first-rare-minerals-shipment-leaves-hay-river-1.6428596#:~:text=Once%20there%2C%20it%20will%20be,to%20Norway%20for%20further%20processing)) ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/significant-day-for-the-north-nechalacho-s-first-rare-minerals-shipment-leaves-hay-river-1.6428596#:~:text=Once%20further%20processing%20is%20complete,be%20used%20in%20electric%20vehicles)).  Similarly, MP Materials signed GM for ultramotor magnets ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%202023%2C%20the%20MP%20team,exciting%20verticals%20of%20today%E2%80%99s%20global)).  Although Ho is not primary in NdFeB (Dy/Tb dominate), rising magnet performance specs may incrementally use Ho.  (Alloy makers like REalloys and DOE programs forecast multihundred‐MT RE alloy demand in 2030 ([www.realloys.com](https://www.realloys.com/blog-posts/realloys-inc-signs-joint-mou-with-saskatchewan-research-council-enabling-processing-of-rare-earth-materials-for-high-performance-magnet-production-in-q2-2025#:~:text=magnet%20materials,includes%3A%20National%20Defense)) ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%202023%2C%20the%20MP%20team,exciting%20verticals%20of%20today%E2%80%99s%20global)).)  
• **Defense/Laser Systems:** Holmium is used in high-energy lasers (e.g. Ho:YAG surgical/military lasers) and fiber-optic amplifiers.  Defense modernization and advanced communications drive some Ho demand.  Rare‐earth elements are critical for guidance, radar, drones, and directed‐energy lasers ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20materials%20are%20used,array%20of%20end%20markets%2C%20including)).  For example, Ho’s 2.1 μm laser line is key in some military sensors and medical devices ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20materials%20are%20used,array%20of%20end%20markets%2C%20including)).  Growth in these sectors (e.g. USN, USAF laser programs) implies a modest increase in allied Ho usage.  
• **Electronics/Optics:** Holmium oxide (Ho₂O₃) is a stable wavelength calibration standard for optical spectrophotometry ([www.nist.gov](https://www.nist.gov/publications/holmium-oxide-glass-wavelengths-standards#:~:text=PUBLICATIONS%20,shown%20very%20little%20variation%20from)). Photonics industry growth (optical networking, microscopy) means steady Ho demand for calibration glass.  Likewise, specialty glass and ceramics (colorants) use Ho in small amounts.  
• **Nuclear/Industrial:** Some nuclear reactors use Ho or Er in control/absorber rods, though overall contribution is minor. Allied nuclear power capacity (and research reactors) may consume tens of MT of HREEs by 2030.  Overall, Ho’s demand remains niche; most allied projections emphasize NdPr and Dy/Tb, so we estimate **allied Ho demand on the order of 500–1,000 MT/yr by 2030** (broad range, reflecting limited public data).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
• **U.S.:** Mountain Pass is scaling up (Stage II roasting, Stage III metallurgy) to roughly maintain ~40–50k MT/yr REO concentrate ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=,5)) (maximal design above 60k known).  Without a major new mine, US output stays flat/slow-growth.  Domestic heavy‐RE fractions remain bottlenecked.  Supplemental supply will come via imports and allied cooperation (e.g. Sumitomo supplying separated HREEs from Lynas/Mp overseas ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=Signed%20distribution%20agreement%20with%20Sumitomo,providing%20access%20to%20Japanese%20customers))). The US is also launching recycling (e.g. DoD’s REE recycling projects ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4033048/department-of-defense-awards-51-million-to-recover-rare-earth-elements-from-rec/#:~:text=Release%20www,restart%20an%20existing%20demonstration%20facility))). By 2030 U.S.-sourced Ho oxide might be in the low hundreds of MT/yr, barring large new projects.  
• **Canada:** Nechalacho is ramping to 9,286 MT/yr REO ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/nechalacho-rare-earth-elements-project-thor-lake-northwest-territories/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20estimated%20to,mine%20life%20of%2020%20years)); with 25,000 t/yr concentrate by 2025 ([www.mromagazine.com](https://www.mromagazine.com/2022/05/23/first-canadian-rare-earth-mine-starts-shipping-concentrate-from-n-w-t/#:~:text=By%202025%2C%20Nechalacho%20hopes%20to,decades%20to%20come%2C%20Connelly%20said)), even more if extended.  Additional projects (e.g. Quebec’s Kipawa, Nova Scotia clays) may add another few thousand REO.  Processing plants (Saskatchewan Research Council separation hub) began in 2024, supporting up to ~1,000 MT/yr of separated REO.  Thus by 2030 Canada could supply on the order of **10,000+ MT/yr REO**, equating to a few hundred tonnes of HREEs including Ho (given Nechalacho’s >20% HREE content ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/nechalacho-rare-earth-elements-project-thor-lake-northwest-territories/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20estimated%20to,mine%20life%20of%2020%20years))).  
• **Australia:** Lynas is expanding Mt Weld concentrate output and processing.  From 10,908 t/yr now ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)), Lynas expects prill expansions plus a new Kalgoorlie refinery (2024–25) to boost total to ≈15–20k MT/yr REO by 2030.  Australia also has the Arafura Resources Nolans project (light REE with little Ho) coming on in late 2020s.  Combined, Australia should supply ≥15k MT REO/yr, producing maybe 100–200 MT Ho (assuming heavy fraction 1–2%).  
• **EU (incl. UK/Scandinavia):** If Greenland’s Kvanefjeld opens (policy permitting), it could add multi-thousand ton REO/year capacity – but it is currently stalled.  Otherwise, the EU’s only supply in 2030 is recycled and imports.  Norway/Iceland have no REE mines; Iceland has geothermal brine R&D (not commercial).  Expected domestic Ho supply in EU by 2030 is near zero without Greenland.  
• **Japan:** Still no domestic mine; Japan depends entirely on imports (mostly from Australia/US). It is building some separation (JOGMEC projects) and recycling plants (magnet making/recovery) into the 2030s.  Domestic REE oxide output will remain negligible – perhaps a few hundred MT of oxide from recycling (NdFeB magnets, electronics) by 2030, yielding only a few MT Ho.

## Key Discovery Technologies
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry detects Th/U-bearing monazite and xenotime. Heavy rare-earth deposits (often thorium-rich) produce distinct radiometric anomalies. For example, Monumental Minerals’ heli-borne radiometric survey outlined two 8 km-long HREE anomalies at the Jemi project (Mexico) coinciding with monazite/eudialyte zones ([monumental.energy](https://monumental.energy/2022/05/monumental-minerals-corp-airborne-geophysical-survey-defines-8-km-prospective-radiometric-trend-and-conducts-site-visit-at-jemi-heavy-rare-earth-project-mexico/#:~:text=The%20Jemi%20HREE%20Project%20airborne,of%20Monumental%E2%80%99s%20management%20and%20technical)).  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Mapping of carbonatite–alkaline complexes, pegmatites or REE-rich seams guides exploration. Systematic soil and stream-sediment geochemistry (using XRF/ICP analyses for Ce, La, Nd, Y, etc.) identifies “bright spots.”  Example: Mt Weld’s carbonatite complex was delineated by mapping and clay geochemistry, revealing a lateritic REE deposit ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/70248416#:~:text=Carbonatite,the%20formation%20of%20secondary%20minerals)). Heavy lanthanide anomalies in vegetation or soils (e.g. Y/Gd spikes) similarly flag prospects.  
• **Airborne Geophysics:** Magnetometer and gravity surveys locate buried intrusions. Carbonatites often contain magnetite/pyrochlore; magnetics can outline their extents. EM and VLF surveys detect conductive clay/mineral zones. Monumental Minerals flew a 1,122 km heli-borne mag+EM survey to reveal Jemi’s prospective complex ([monumental.energy](https://monumental.energy/2022/05/monumental-minerals-corp-airborne-geophysical-survey-defines-8-km-prospective-radiometric-trend-and-conducts-site-visit-at-jemi-heavy-rare-earth-project-mexico/#:~:text=Corp,29%2C%202022)). Modern projects use high-resolution drone and UAV geophysics for detail.  
• **Hyperspectral & Remote Sensing:** UAV/multispectral (VNIR/SWIR) sensors and satellite data (e.g. ASTER) are applied to identify REE-bearing minerals by their spectral signatures. Hyperspectral imaging can discriminate Nd/Ho by narrow absorption bands (e.g. near 580–870 nm) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/5160#:~:text=elements,determining%20neodymium%20at%20outcrop%20surfaces)). Ground-based or airborne spectrometers are “fast, noninvasive” for mapping REE-rich outcrops ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/5160#:~:text=elements,determining%20neodymium%20at%20outcrop%20surfaces)), as demonstrated on Nechalacho and Fen carbonatites. This reduces drilling needs and environmental impact.  
• **AI/ML Exploration:** New AI tools (e.g. DOE/NETL’s GAIA) combine geospatial/geologic datasets to predict “hidden” REE deposits. DOE reports that machine-learning models trained on existing mine data recently “uncovered a record-setting rare earth deposit” in U.S. basins ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/technologycommercialization/articles/ai-tool-speeds-critical-mineral-hunt-boosting-us-supply#:~:text=Blog)). Such AI-guided prospecting (combining remote-sensed geology, geophysics, geochemistry) accelerates discovery of subtle REE targets (ion-adsorption clays, REE-hosting peat, or overlooked deposits).  

## Key Extraction Technologies
• **Physical Concentration:** Crushing/milling ore followed by gravity (spirals, shaking tables) and magnetic/electrostatic separation to concentrate heavy minerals. Monazite, xenotime and eudialyte are denser/magnetic – they are separated from gangue via dense-media separation and high-intensity magnetic separators. For example, the Nechalacho plan includes a 2,000 t/d concentrator to produce a ~8,300 t/yr TREO concentrate ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/nechalacho-rare-earth-elements-project-thor-lake-northwest-territories/#:~:text=The%20rare%20earth%20element%20project,of%20separated%20rare%20earth%20oxides)). Flotation (using fatty acids or amines) is also common to float REE-phosphates. These beneficiation steps yield a mixed REE concentrate (phosphate or carbonate) for chemical processing.  
• **Acid/Caustic Leaching:** Chemical breakdown of concentrates.  *Sulfate Roasting:* Monazite concentrate is digested in hot H₂SO₄ (≈200 °C) to dissolve REEs and Th/U ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Starting%20from%20the%20monazite%20concentrate%2C,are%20part%20of%20the%20concentrate)).  *Caustic cracking:* Alternatively, autoclave or alkaline (NaOH) digestion breaks down monazite into concentrated hydroxides (common in India/Australia).  *Clay Leaching:* For ion-adsorption clays, simple leaching with (NH₄)₂SO₄ or Na₂SO₄ solutions exchanges REEs into solution ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20found%20in,44%7DCl)).  These hydrometallurgical steps produce solutions of RE chlorides/sulfates.  
• **Selective Precipitation:** The leach solution’s pH is carefully raised in stages to selectively precipitate unwanted or target elements ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=First%2C%20a%20treatment%20with%20ammonium,of%20the%20rare%20earths%20precipitate)).  For monazite, Th is first precipitated (as Th-sulfate) at low pH ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=First%2C%20a%20treatment%20with%20ammonium,of%20the%20rare%20earths%20precipitate)), then REEs as hydroxides.  By intermediate pH adjustments, uranium and residual Th are removed, leaving a purified REE precipitate.  In clay leach (e.g. Chinese process), REEs in solution are precipitated as oxalates by adding oxalic acid ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Rare%20earths%20are%20found%20in,44%7DCl)) (calcined to RE oxides).  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX) & Ion Exchange:** Although often classed as “separation,” large-scale extraction begins here: REE-rich solutions are contacted with extractant chemicals (organophosphorus or carboxylic acids) in mixer-settlers. SX removes impurities (Fe, Al) and grouped REEs from the aqueous phase.  For example, tributyl phosphate (TBP) or alkyl phosphoric acids selectively strip HREEs into organic phase ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=First%2C%20a%20treatment%20with%20ammonium,of%20the%20rare%20earths%20precipitate)) ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Starting%20from%20a%20rare%20earth,are%20separated)).  In clays processing, SX is used after leaching to concentrate individual lanthanides.  *Ion-exchange and resin*: Though used more for separation than coarse extraction, resins (Tiatan, DGA) and in-line chromatographic columns are now used to purify REE solutions before SX (and also to recover REEs from dilute solutions).  
• **Emerging Methods:** New techniques aim to reduce chemical use.  *Molecular Recognition Technology (MRT)* uses tailored ligands to bind one REE at a time from solution; *RapidSX* (Ucore’s flow-column SX) can continuously process mixed solution, improving throughput ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/home-advantage-how-domestic-ree-supply-is-supercharging-north-american-companies-301846636.html#:~:text=A%20watershed%20moment%20is%20imminent,generation%20vehicles)).  *Bioleaching* (microbial breakdown) and *in-situ leaching* (acid injection into ore bodies) are being researched, but not yet proven at scale for HREEs.  (High-pressure CO₂ carbonate precipitation has been demonstrated to separate lanthanide groups ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)) but remains experimental.)

## Key Separation Technologies
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** By far the dominant tech for REE separation. After leaching, the remaining REE mixture is subjected to multi-stage SX.  In SX, organic solvents (e.g. DEHPA, Versatic 10, naphthenic acids) in kerosene/hydrocarbon are used to preferentially dissolve specific lanthanide subsets ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Starting%20from%20a%20rare%20earth,are%20separated)) ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=,number%20of%20the%20metallic%20element)).  Typically the cascade first isolates heavy lanthanides (Ho, Er, etc.) from mid and light groups ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Starting%20from%20a%20rare%20earth,are%20separated)), then refines each element.  For instance, DEHPA extractant has increasing affinity from La→Lu ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=,number%20of%20the%20metallic%20element)), so adjusting pH and extractant mix separates out Ho from adjacent Dy/Tb. Modern SX plants use dozens of mixer-settler stages to achieve 99.99%-pure oxides.  
• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatography:** Many new projects (allied) supplement or replace parts of SX with ion-exchange. For example, Mitsubishi/Arafura have piloted monosodium titanate or resin columns to remove trace impurities.  Ucore’s “RapidSX” is a continuous column system (Ontario demo in 2024 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/home-advantage-how-domestic-ree-supply-is-supercharging-north-american-companies-301846636.html#:~:text=A%20watershed%20moment%20is%20imminent,generation%20vehicles))), effectively a moving-bed SX.  Chromatographic separation (multiple narrow columns) is used in Japan and Europe (e.g. European Battery Alliance-supported TRL labs) to ultra-purify each REE.  Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and new ligands can isolate single rare earths.  
• **Precipitation & Selective Oxidation:** As a complement to SX, methods like cerium leverage are used.  Ce(III) can be oxidized to Ce(IV) and precipitated out, simplifying separation ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)).  Similarly, small-scale methods (like mercury cathode reduction for Eu) exist.  Supercritical CO₂ precipitation (carbonate “stripping”) has been shown to co-precipitate La, Nd, Sm, Gd and Ho from solutions ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)), leaving others in solution – a novel group-separation. These are currently niche/lab-scale.  
• **Membrane & Solvent Innovations:** Some pilot systems use hollow-fiber membranes impregnated with SX extractants to reduce solvent use.  Ionic liquid solvents are also being tested for high selectivity (e.g. MDIPA ionic liquid binds HREEs selectively).  Overall, allied R&D is focused on matching China’s SX dominance by deploying U.S./E.U. vendors (Lynas-TX plant with Sumitomo tech, SRC/Ucore projects) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/home-advantage-how-domestic-ree-supply-is-supercharging-north-american-companies-301846636.html#:~:text=A%20watershed%20moment%20is%20imminent,generation%20vehicles)) ([www.realloys.com](https://www.realloys.com/blog-posts/realloys-inc-signs-joint-mou-with-saskatchewan-research-council-enabling-processing-of-rare-earth-materials-for-high-performance-magnet-production-in-q2-2025#:~:text=magnet%20materials,includes%3A%20National%20Defense)).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
• **Grinding & Calcination:** The wet-processed REE precipitates (hydroxides, oxalates, carbonates) are **calcined** at high temperature (600–900 °C) to form pure rare-earth oxides (REOs).  Repeated calcine + leach cycles are used to remove contaminants.  Careful calcining (in rotary kilns) also drives off bound radionuclides (Th) as leaving less soluble phases.  High-grade REO (>99.9% total REO purity) is the feedstock for further metallurgy.  
• **Metal Production (Electrolytic/Metallothermic):** To make metals, the pure oxides are often converted to fluorides or chlorides and fed into molten-salt electrolysis cells (chlorine/REE halide electrolysis) or fused salt caustic reduction.  For example, Nd/Pr metal is commonly produced by molten LiCl–KCl electrolysis (e.g. the Ames process) and Sm/Dy by similar routes.  Vacuum distillation and iodide processes are legacy methods as well.  Alternatively, metallothermic reduction (e.g. Ca or Al reduction) is used: e.g., Ho oxide mixed with Ca and heated yields Ho metal and CaO which is leached away. This is how many HREE metals were first produced.  MP Materials’ Stage III plans in Fort Worth involve direct production of NdFeB magnet alloy (melting Nd metal with Fe/B) ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CFor%202023%2C%20the%20MP%20team,exciting%20verticals%20of%20today%E2%80%99s%20global)).  
• **Refinement / Alloying:** The raw RE metals (Nd, Pr, Dy, Ho, etc.) are cast into ingots, crushed to powders, and alloyed.  Powder metallurgy (melt-spinning, hydrogen decrepitation) produces magnet powders.  Final steps include vacuum sintering, heat treating and machining of magnets.  For non-magnet Ho, manufacturers may alloy Ho with other metals (e.g. forming Ho-magnesium or Ho-cobalt for niche uses).  High-purity Ho metal (>99.99%) requires zone-refining or multiple distillation steps to remove residual impurities (Fe, Ca, etc.).  
• **Specialty Purifications:** If even higher purity is needed, chemical refinements (liquid–liquid extraction at each lanthanide) or ion chromatography can produce 6N (99.9999%) Ho. Some labs distill holmium metal under vacuum to separate it from residual lower-boiling lanthanides.  Final products (Ho₂O₃ powder, Ho metal, Ho alloy) may be encapsulated under inert gas for sale.  Allied companies are building this step domestically: e.g., Arafura (NT/NSW) and Japan’s metal converters plan to refine heavy REE, including Ho, rather than export mixed oxides.  

## Key Remediation Technologies
• **Tailings Neutralization and Stabilization:** Rare-earth mining typically yields phosphatic tailings often containing Th/U. Neutralizing acidic effluents (pH adjustment with Ca(OH)₂ or MgO) precipitates REEs and radionuclides as insoluble hydroxides.  For example, during monazite cracking, adjusting pH to ~1–2 precipitates Th-sulfate ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=First%2C%20a%20treatment%20with%20ammonium,of%20the%20rare%20earths%20precipitate)); raising to ~6 precipitates uranium (hydroxyuranate) ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=First%2C%20a%20treatment%20with%20ammonium,of%20the%20rare%20earths%20precipitate)).  In mines, adding lime/limestone to tailings ponds fixes dissolved metals and reduces mobility. Phosphate binders or cementation can further immobilize contaminants.  
• **Water Treatment & Recycling:** Process waters (containing residual REEs, Th) are treated with ion-exchange or precipitative cleanup.  Strong-base anion/cation resins can capture trace REEs or U from effluents.  Advanced methods (membrane filtration, electrodialysis) recover and concentrate residual REEs from waste streams, reducing loss.  The removed metals (as hydroxides) can be returned to the process, closing loops.  
• **Bioremediation:** Certain bacteria and fungi can accumulate heavy metals and radionuclides. Research is underway on using microbial consortia to bioleach REE or adsorb contaminants from water.  For example, sulfate-reducing bacteria can precipitate U as UO₂, aiding in radioactive cleanup.  Likewise, aquatic plants or constructed wetlands have been tested to sequester REEs from mine drainage. These are mostly pilot-scale (e.g. US EPA/DOE funding novel biotechnologies).  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Instead of disposal, older tailings (often enriched in REEs after decades) can be crushed and re-leached with modern technology, recovering additional REEs (and cleaning up).  Projects in China and Europe are already re-treating monazite-rich tailings to extract remaining REEs and immobilize Th into stable minerals. Such secondary recovery both increases supply and mitigates environmental impact.  
• **Spent Reagent Recycle:** Acidic leachants (H₂SO₄, (NH₄)₂SO₄) can be recovered by evaporation/crystallization.  For example, magnesium sulfate leach can be recovered by Mg(OH)₂ precipitation, freeing acid. Recycling chemicals reduces tailings toxicity. U.S. DOE/DoD projects (e.g. REEcycle Inc.) are demonstrating closed-loop processes that recover reagents and critical metals from scrap, which could be adapted to mining waste.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production 
• **Heavy REE Separation Infrastructure:**  The crucial bottleneck is the lack of large-scale domestic capacity to isolate heavy lanthanides (Ho, Dy, Tb, etc.) from mixed REO.  While mining or concentrate production can be scaled, only China currently has mature industrial plants for HREE separation. Allied firms have emerging small separations or magnets pilots (e.g. Ucore’s RapidSX demo, SRC in Saskatchewan), but full-scale heavy-REE smelters/mills are absent.  MP Materials itself notes that “heavy rare earth front-end engineering” is only now being designed ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Improved%20sales%20volumes%2012,lead%20procurement)). Until robust SX/ion-exchange facilities come online in the US/Canada/EU/Australia, Ho remains scarce despite any increase in ore supply.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences) 
In brief, the chokepoint is domestic processing – specifically HREE separation.  The U.S. and allied nations can mine or import REE ores, but converting those into pure holmium oxide/metal requires sophisticated solvent-extraction plants.  Currently, planned processing facilities (e.g. MP Materials Stage II/III ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=%2A%20Improved%20sales%20volumes%2012,lead%20procurement)), Ucore’s RapidSX pilot ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/home-advantage-how-domestic-ree-supply-is-supercharging-north-american-companies-301846636.html#:~:text=A%20watershed%20moment%20is%20imminent,generation%20vehicles)), Lynas-TX refinement) are not yet operational at full scale. Thus the absence of mature, high-throughput Ho separation/refinement technology is the key bottleneck in scaling US/allied Holmium production.
