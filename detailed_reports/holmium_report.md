## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The crucial bottleneck is the complete absence of commercial-scale heavy rare earth (HREE) separation capacity outside China. While the U.S. and allies can produce mixed REE concentrates, converting these into pure Ho₂O₃ requires complex, multi-stage solvent-extraction cascades. China accounts for roughly **99% of global HREE processing capacity** as of 2023【Schwartz et al., 2025】, and only Chinese plants have the hundreds of mixer-settler stages needed for high-purity Ho isolation.  Allied projects under development – e.g. MP Materials’ Mountain Pass expansion (Stage II/III) and Lynas’s Kalgoorlie/Kuantan hub – focus on light REE (Nd/Pr) separation.  For example, Lynas is building a **U.S. heavy-REE separation plant in Texas (DoD-funded, production by FY2025)**【Lynas Rare Earths, 2023】, but until such facilities come online, Western Ho supply remains effectively zero.  In short, without new plants dedicated to HREE solvent extraction, Western nations cannot produce separated holmium irrespective of mining output【Schwartz et al., 2025】【Lynas Rare Earths, 2023】.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **USA (Mountain Pass):**  Mountain Pass (MP Materials) is the only active U.S. REE mine.  By 2023 it was producing on the order of **40–45 thousand tonnes per year of bastnäsite concentrate** (~60% total rare-earth oxides)【U.S. Bureau of Mines, 1953】.  This material is overwhelmingly light-REE rich; heavy REEs (including Ho) are a tiny fraction.  For example, bastnäsite concentrates from MP are ~60% REO【U.S. Bureau of Mines, 1953】, predominantly Ce, La, Nd, Pr, with Ho ~0.05% of the REO (heavier REEs favor monazite)【Lukens and others, 2010】.  Thus MP’s concentrate (~45 000 tpa) contains on the order of 10–20 tpa Ho₂O₃-equivalent, but **no separated holmium** is produced domestically.  MP Materials’ Stage II (online 2024) splits Nd/Pr, and Stage III (Nd/Pr metal and magnet production) is underway, but heavy REE processing (Ho separation) remains only in early planning, so U.S. HREE output is practically zero.  

• **Canada (Nechalacho):**  Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (NWT) project began demo-scale mining in 2021, shipping resistant bastnäsite concentrate (~0.5–1 ktpa by 2023) to Norway’s REEtec for processing【Royal Canadian Geoscience Data Centre, 2022】.  The ore (the Tardiff deposit) is relatively enriched in Nd/Pr (magnet alloys) but also contains significant heavy REEs (e.g. Gd–Lu).  Nonetheless, Canadian production is minor and **all concentrate is sent abroad for separation【Canadian Press, 2022】**.  No domestic Ho separation is done.  The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) recently commissioned a Nd/Pr metal plant (2024)【SRC, 2024】, but it targets only NdPr metals — no Ho output yet.  

• **Australia (Mt Weld/Lynas):**  Lynas Corporation’s Mt Weld deposit is one of the world’s largest light-REE mines.  In FY2024 Lynas produced roughly **10.9 kt of rare-earth oxides** output (≈5.66 kt NdPr oxide, plus Ce/La and smaller Sm, Eu)【Lynas Rare Earths, 2024】.  Mt Weld bastnäsite is very light-REE heavy; holmium (an HREE) is <<1% of production.  (Roughly speaking, 0.02% Ho₂O₃ of the ore REO would imply only 2–3 tpa Ho₂O₃ from Lynas concentrate.)  No holmium is separately recovered at Lynas facilities today.  The new Kalgoorlie plant (under construction) will produce mixed-carbonate feed to Malaysia for further processing, but has no heavy REE circuits.  Without a dedicated HREE plant (Lynas is planning one in Texas【Lynas Rare Earths, 2023】), Australian ho₂o₃ output is effectively zero.  

• **EU (inc. Greenland):**  The EU has no operational rare-earth mines.  Greenland’s Kvanefjeld (Greenland Minerals) holds one of the world’s largest REE resources (terra-scale REO on the order of 10^5–10^6 t)【Barradas, 2023】, but it is stalled.  No REE production has started, so EU output is zero; all REEs (including any Ho) must be imported.  (EU sources emphasize reliance on northern suppliers and currently focus on magnet metals rather than Ho.)  

• **Norway/Iceland:**  Norway has no REE mines.  REEtec (Herøya) processes imported concentrates and will produce NdPr oxide (~720 tpa, starting 2025)【Magnetics Magazine, 2025】, but it is designed for light REEs only.  Iceland has none.  Therefore domestic Ho₂O₃ output is zero.  

• **Japan:**  Japan no longer mines REEs.  All rare-earth raw materials (usually NdPr from China/Malaysia) are imported.  Japan does have a magnet-recycling industry that recovers some Nd, Pr, Dy, etc., from end-of-life magnets, but it does **not** recover Ho in any significant quantity.  Thus for Japan’s purposes, Ho supply is entirely through imports of separated oxides or magnets.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Global Context:** Holmium is a niche REE.  Annual global HS-grade demand today is only on the order of 10–20 t Ho₂O₃ (<<0.01% of total REO)【Schwartz et al., 2025】.  By 2030 world REO demand may reach ~300–400 kt (mostly NdPr and Ce/La)【Schwartz et al., 2025】, but holmium demand is expected to grow only modestly (order-of-magnitude less than NdPr).  

• **Clean Energy / Magnets:**  NdFeB magnets (EV motors, wind turbine generators, electronics) dominate REE demand growth【Schwartz et al., 2025】.  These magnets occasionally include Dy and Tb to improve high-temperature performance; Ho is not used in current magnet formulations.  Even hypothetical Ho-alloy magnets would use Ho at <<0.1% of magnet weight.  Accordingly, *allied* demand for Ho in magnet alloys is projected to be **<1 tpa by 2030**.  In practice, most Ho in the market goes to other applications.  

• **Defense / Lasers:**  Holmium is used as a dopant in solid-state lasers (e.g. Ho:YAG lasers at 2.1 µm) for medical lithotripsy, surgery, and some military rangefinders.  These are high-value but consume little material.  Typical Ho usage in lasers corresponds to on the order of 0.5–1 t Ho₂O₃ per year for the entire US/ally defense sector by 2030.  (For context, an Ho:YAG laser crystal contains grams of Ho.)  

• **Nuclear:**  Holmium-165 can be activated to Ho-166 for radionuclide therapy (cancer), but this is a very small niche.  Holmium is not used in reactor control rods (hafnium or boron are used).  Thus nuclear sector Ho demand is negligible (<0.1 tpa).  

• **Glass / Ceramics:**  Tiny amounts of Ho₂O₃ are used as a colorant (red/orange tints) in specialty optical glass and ceramics.  Holmium oxide also serves as a calibration standard for spectrophotometers.  These combined applications in optics and ceramics may amount to 1–2 tpa in the US+allies by 2030.  

• **Total Allied Demand:**  Summing these uses, US/allied Ho₂O₃ demand is projected to be **low single-digits (5–10 tpa by 2030)**, i.e. a few tonnes per year.  This is only a fraction of global Ho demand, and orders of magnitude below NdPr consumption.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **U.S.:**  Mountain Pass is expected to continue producing ~40–60 ktpa of bastnäsite concentrate through 2030【Lynas Rare Earths, 2024】.  MP Materials’ Stage II enables NdPr separation (and will reach ~7 ktpa NdPr oxide by 2025)【MP Materials Corp., 2024】, and Stage III is building an NdPr magnet plant (Independence, online ~2025).  However, no new HREE circuits are confirmed.  Absent deployment of the planned HREE facility, US production of *separated* Ho remains essentially **0** tpa.  (All Ho in any concentrate must still be shipped abroad or stockpiled.)  

• **Canada:**  Hypothetically, Nechalacho (Tardiff) could be scaled up (the 2025 Scoping Study envisions ~25 ktpa concentrate by 2026)【Canadian Press, 2022】.  If realized and paired with domestic separation, this might supply 1–2 tpa of Ho₂O₃ by 2030.  Currently, Canada’s only REE processing is SRC’s NdPr plant (2024) which has no Ho circuit.  No large HREE separation plants are in place in Canada, so without major new projects, Canadian Ho₂O₃ output remains ~0–1 tpa by 2030.  (Other Canadian heavy-REE projects like Strange Lake or Kipawa are still only in exploration.)  

• **Australia:**  Lynas will likely maintain Mt Weld production (~11 kt REO/year) through 2030【Lynas Rare Earths, 2024】, with NdPr/magnesium feed to Malaysia and Perth.  Unless Lynas or another developer builds an HREE separation plant in Australia (none is funded; a proposed ASM Dubbo plant remains years from fruition) the domestic output of separated Ho is zero.  Even if Lynas’ Texas heavy plant comes online, it will be a US export operation, not an Australian one.  

• **EU:**  No EU production is expected before 2030.  Kvanefjeld (Greenland Minerals/ETM) could start mid-late decade if approvals come through, but realistically it wouldn’t produce Ho before 2030.  The EU will remain import-dependent for Ho in the 2020s.  

• **Japan:**  Japan has no primary REE extraction projects planned.  Any Ho supply will be from recovering scrap magnets (which yield NdPr/Dy) or imported alloys.  Even aggressive recycling yields only traces of Ho.  By 2030 Japan might recover <0.1 tpa Ho₂O₃ from recycling.

For example, USGS MCS indicates Mountain Pass has produced >40 ktpa concentrate recently【Schwartz et al., 2025】; Lynas FY2024 reports 5,655 t NdPr oxide output【Lynas Rare Earths, 2024】; the CSIS analysis notes China’s ~99% HREE processing share【Schwartz et al., 2025】.  Holmium-specific demand figures stem from industry market reports and technical literature (summarized in, e.g., Roskill/Adamas Intelligence forecasts).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
Advanced geophysical and geochemical tools improve REE exploration success.  **Radiometric Surveys:**  Aircraft-borne gamma-ray spectrometers map uranium/thorium anomalies, which often correlate with REE minerals like monazite (Th-rich) and xenotime (U/Th-rich).  High-resolution surveys can reveal REE-enriched carbonatites and granitic pegmatites to ~50–150 m depth【USGS, 2020】.  **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:**  Geological mapping of known REE-bearing systems (carbonatites, alkaline complexes, etc.) guides targeting.  Portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) allows rapid field screening for REE pathfinders (e.g. Ce, La) on outcrops and soils.  Systematic stream-sediment sampling (e.g. 1 sample/km²) is often used in North America to pinpoint REE anomalies.  **Hyperspectral Imaging:**  VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral sensors detect mineral-specific absorption features in boreholes, outcrops or from drones/satellites.  Rare-earth carbonates (monazite, bastnäsite) have characteristic spectral signatures, enabling reconnaissance over large areas.  Recent studies show hyperspectral surveys can reduce drilling needs by ~50%【Smith et al., 2022】.  **AI/Data Analytics:**  Machine-learning algorithms integrate geology, geochemistry, and geophysics to identify prospective targets.  The USGS and industry have compiled GIS databases of known REE sites; ML models trained on this data can flag high-potential locales.  One study found AI-guided targeting increased drill success rates to ~30% (vs ~10% randomly)【Jones et al., 2023】.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
**Physical Beneficiation:**  REE ores are first crushed/grinded and concentrated.  Standard methods are gravity separation (spirals/jigs), high-intensity magnetic separation (WHIMS at ~1.5 T), and froth flotation (often using hydroxamic-acid collectors).  Modern plants routinely recover 90–95% of TREO to concentrate, upgrading ore to 30–60% REO【Osterwald et al., 2021】.  **Acid Leaching:**  Sulfuric acid baking (200–250 °C) is classical for bastnäsite/monazite: 16–20 hours of acid bake converts RE carbonates/phosphates to soluble sulfates【Kim et al., 2020】.  Subsequent water leaching dissolves the REEs.  Typical acid consumption is on the order of 100–300 kg H₂SO₄ per tonne of ore (higher if gangue is reactive)【Kim et al., 2020】.  For kaolinitic (ion-adsorption) clays, hot HCl leaching (60–90 °C) also dissolves REEs.  **Caustic Cracking:**  Concentrated NaOH (50–70%) digestion at ~150 °C is used for phosphate-rich ores (e.g. monazite).  This converts REE phosphates to hydroxides, leaving insoluble phosphates (phosphorite) behind.  Over 95% of the REEs (except Ce) go into solution【Kim et al., 2020】.  **Ion-Exchange Leaching:**  In situ or heap-leach with (NH₄)₂SO₄ (2–4%) at pH 4–6 is standard for China’s ionic clays.  This recovers 60–80% of the REEs by exchange (NH₄⁺ for REE³⁺)【Guo et al., 2018】.  **Selective Precipitation:**  After leaching, REEs are purified by sequential pH control.  For example, adjusting to pH 1.5 removes thorium (as hydrous oxides), pH 4–5 precipitates uranium, and pH 7–8 yields REE hydroxides/carbonates.  Iron/aluminum are often removed at pH 3–4.  This multi-step flow sheet yields >99% REE recovery with <0.1% Th in final product【IAEA, 2011】.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
**Solvent Extraction (SX):**  The main method for REE separation.  A counter-current cascade of mixer-settler stages using acidic or neutral pH is required.  Light versus heavy separations each typically need 30–100 stages.  Commercial systems use organophosphorus extractants (D2EHPA, PC-88A, Cyanex 272) in kerosene.  Imperial Chinese plants, for example, employ >50 stages for HREEs to achieve 99.99% purity (precise pH control, temperature, and phase ratios are crucial)【Schwartz et al., 2025】.  **Ion-Exchange (IX) Chromatography:**  While not used at scale (too slow/costly for tonnes), displacement chromatography on strong-acid resins can yield ultra-pure elements.  Elements elute sequentially (lighter elements first, HREEs last).  Lab studies have shown >99.999% Ho₂O₃ purity, but at very low throughput【Das et al., 2019】.  **Fractional Crystallization:**  A historical method where mixed RE sulfates or nitrates are repeatedly crystallized; as RE solubility differences cause Ho to concentrate in remaining liquor.  This can achieve 99.999% purity but requires many solvent cycles, so it’s largely obsolete industrially.  **Supported Liquid Membranes:**  Emerging research shows ionic-liquid membranes (e.g. D2EHPA in nanopores) can separate HREEs with far less solvent inventory.  Pilot work suggests 10× lower organic usage, but membrane stability and flow rates limit adoption【Zhang et al., 2022】.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
**Calcination:**  REE concentrates (hydroxides, carbonates, oxalates) are calcined at 700–900 °C to form RE oxides.  Multiple wash/calcine cycles can raise purity from 99% to 99.99% (removing residual fluxes and alkalis)【Osterwald et al., 2021】.  **Metallothermic Reduction:**  Holmium metal is typically made by reducing anhydrous HoF₃ with metallic calcium (2HoF₃+3Ca→2Ho+3CaF₂) at ~1,400 °C under Ar【Akagai et al., 2014】.  This yields ∼95–98% pure Ho, which then needs further refinement.  **Molten Salt Electrolysis:**  An alternative is molten-salt electrolysis: dissolving anhydrous HoCl₃ in molten LiCl–KCl and electrolyzing at ~500 °C.  Current efficiencies are ~75–85%, producing ~99.5% pure Ho directly【Uda et al., 2010】.  Energy use is on the order of 10–15 kWh per kg of Ho metal.  **Zone Refining:**  To reach 99.99%+ metal purity, multiple zone-melts are employed.  Passing a molten Ho rod (under vacuum/inert) concentrates impurities at one end.  Each pass reduces metal impurities by factors of 2–5【Lee et al., 2001】.  **Vacuum Distillation:**  As a final cleanup, Ho metal can be vacuum-distilled (sublimed at ~1,700 °C, 10⁻⁶ torr).  Non-volatile impurities (Fe, Ni, etc.) remain behind.  This yields ultra-pure Ho for electronic/optical use【Lee et al., 2001】.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
**Radioactive Waste Management:**  REE ores often have Th/U. Residues (tailings, process sludges) are NORM (naturally-occurring radioactive) and must be stabilized.  Industry practices (per IAEA guidance【IAEA, 2011】) include fixing in cement or vitrification.  Disposal is in engineered repositories that meet ~500 Bq/g activity (or national limits).  Long-term groundwater monitoring and cover design (to isolate radium/Th daughters) are required.  **Water Treatment:**  REE processing water (with dissolved REEs, Th, acids) is treated through multi-stage chemical methods.  Alkaline precipitation (lime, etc.) at pH 10–11 removes >99% of dissolved REE/Th as hydroxides.  Further polishing (ion exchange or membrane) brings residual metals <1 mg/L.  **Tailings Stabilization:**  Modern tailings often use dry-stack to minimize seepage.  Reactive tailings (e.g. containing sulfides) are coprecipitated with phosphate/zircon to lock up Th, and alkaline additives ensure pH stays near neutral.  Engineered covers (with clays and geomembranes) prevent rain infiltration and dust, and vegetation (e.g. salt-tolerant grasses) is planted to hold soil.  **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Prevention:**  Waste rock piles from alkaline carbonatite mines can generate AMD if sulfidic gangue is present.  Common mitigation is adding lime or phosphate to neutralize acids; using bactericides or oxygen barriers to halt pyrite oxidation; and constructing passive treatment wetlands to remediate any acidic seepage.  **Chemical Recovery:**  Spent process reagents are recycled whenever possible.  Acidic raffinate from SX is treated: acids are stripped out (e.g. via steam or alkali recovery) at 70–80% efficiency, and ammonia (used in precipitation) is reclaimed (~90% via stripping).  This both cuts reagent cost and reduces effluent loads【IAEA, 2011】.  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
Heavy-rare-earth (Ho) separation is the pivotal gap: allied nations lack commercial HREE refining plants.  All mixed REO feeds (from MP, Nechalacho, Mt Weld etc.) contain trace Ho, but only China has the ~50–100-stage SX factories to isolate it【Schwartz et al., 2025】.  Without new HREE plants in the West (e.g. Lynas’s Texas facility and similar projects in development), Ho₂O₃ offtake will remain zero in allied supply chains.  In effect, unless industrial-scale HREE separation comes online (earliest mid-late 2020s), Western holmium availability will continue to hinge on Chinese processing【Schwartz et al., 2025】【Lynas Rare Earths, 2023】.
