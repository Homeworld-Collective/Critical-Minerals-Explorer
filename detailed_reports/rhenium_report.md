## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
The chief bottleneck is **highly inefficient recovery of rhenium from molybdenite roasting and lack of domestic processing infrastructure**. In practice only a small fraction of the Re in molybdenite concentrates is recovered – recent analysis finds **<12% of Re in mined ore is captured** in conventional processing【McCarthy et al., 2024】. The rest is lost to flue emissions or tails.  Even under ideal conditions, recovery beyond ~30–40% of the available Re is challenging【McCarthy et al., 2024】.  Crucially, the US has no modern molybdenum roasting facility with an integrated Re scrubber.  Most U.S. moly concentrates (and their contained Re) are exported overseas, forfeiting domestic Re recovery.  In the absence of new roasters or breakthrough low-grade Re technologies, allied production will remain limited to recycling, far below surging demand【Belda, 2024】【McCarthy et al., 2024】.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~20–25 tons/year from recycling only*  
- **Primary production:** There are **no domestic Re recovery operations** in the US or among most allied countries (EU, Canada, Japan, etc.).  The USGS and industry data confirm zero primary Re output in the US; all domestic supply comes from recycled scrap or imports【Belda, 2024】【McCarthy et al., 2024】.  Germany (and to a lesser extent Poland) recover only a few tons (6–8 t combined) annually as byproducts of imported copper concentrates.  In short, allied nations have **0 t/year of domestic primary Re**.  
- **Secondary (recycling) production:**  The US and Germany lead globally in Re recycling.  Turbine blade and catalyst recyclers recover Re from end-of-life Ni-base superalloy scrap and spent Pt-Re reforming catalysts.  U.S. refining capacity is estimated at roughly **15–20 t/year**, and German refiners about **5–8 t/year**.  Worldwide secondary output was only on the order of tens of tonnes; one report cites ~25 t from recycling in 2023【Belda, 2024】.  Other allied contributions are small (Japan ~2–3 t, France/Canada ~1–2 t each).  Major recyclers include Heraeus (Germany), Molymet (Chile/USA), and Buss & Buss Spezialmetalle (Germany).  In sum, **US/allied production today ≈20–25 t/year from recycling**, with essentially **0 t/year from domestic primary recovery**【Belda, 2024】【McCarthy et al., 2024】.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 50–70 tons/year projected*  
- **Aerospace superalloys (≈70–75% demand):**  The dominant use of Re is in high-temperature jet-engine alloys.  Current turbine engines (e.g. GE’s LEAP, GE9X; P&W PW1000G; Rolls-Royce Trent XWB) use advanced single-crystal Ni-based superalloys (CMSX-4, René N5, etc.) with ~3–6 wt% Re.  Industry sources report aerospace makes up roughly three-quarters of Re consumption【Willing, 2025】.  Aircraft deliveries are expected to grow ~5–6%/yr into 2030, so allied aerospace demand for Re will climb.  Electioned forecasts suggest US/allied aerospace Re needs of roughly **35–45 t/year by 2030**, assuming continued alloy usage and production growth【Belda, 2024】【Willing, 2025】.  
- **Petrochemical catalysts (≈20–25%):**  Re is used in Pt–Re reforming catalysts for gasoline production.  This mature industry is relatively steady; replacement of deactivated catalysts requires about **10–15 t/year** for US and allied refineries.  With refinery capacities roughly flat, catalyst sector demand should remain at this level through 2030.  
- **Medical and emerging uses (~5%):**  New Mo–47%Re alloy devices have been FDA-approved for implants, promising a new demand stream.  FDA approval of Mo–Re in cardiovascular stents (2024) could drive **10–20 t** incremental Re demand globally over a few years【Belda, 2024】.  Other niche uses (high-temp thermocouples, X-ray targets, rocket nozzles) contribute <2 t/year.  
- **2030 total demand:**  Combining these sectors, US/allied consumption is projected to reach roughly **50–70 t/year by 2030**.  The U.S. currently consumes about 20–25 t/year (mostly in domestic aero/alloy production), with Europe and Japan another ~20–25 t【Belda, 2024】【Willing, 2025】.  With aerospace demand continuing its ~5–6% annual rise and steady industrial use, allied demand will exceed current output by decades’ end.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 30–40 tons/year maximum capacity*  
- **Recycling expansion:**  Domestic supply will come almost entirely from recycled material.  With higher Re prices and strategic interest, allied recycling could be scaled up.  Current allied recycling (~20–25 t/yr) might rise toward **30–40 t/yr by 2030** with investment in recovery facilities.  Firms like Heraeus, Molymet, and Japanese refiners are developing improved recovery processes for spent catalysts and superalloy scrap.  However, growth is limited by scrap availability and collection logistics; even aggressive recycle expansion will leave a large supply shortfall.  
- **Potential byproduct recovery:**  The U.S. has major molybdenum mines (e.g. Climax, Henderson) with molybdenite rich in trace Re (often 10–50 ppm).  In principle, installing smelter-roaster capacity could yield some Re.  But technologists note that low (ppm) grades and the high cost of new roasting/scrubbing plants make economics unfavorable【McCarthy et al., 2024】.  At present there are **no firm plans** to add Re recovery circuits at U.S. Mo or Cu mills.  
- **Import dependency:**  With domestic recycling perhaps reaching only 30–40 t/yr by 2030 versus demand 50–70 t/yr, roughly **40–50% of allied needs must be met by imports**.  Currently major import sources are Chile (Molymet’s concentrate roaster output) and Kazakhstan.  In 2023 China alone imported ~26 t from Chile (≈Molymet’s full output)【Willing, 2025】.  The U.S. imported on the order of 15–20 t in 2023 from allied suppliers and mined primary outside North America【Willing, 2025】【Belda, 2024】.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: porphyry copper-molybdenum exploration; molybdenite geochemistry; airborne geophysics; ICP-MS analysis*  

- **Porphyry exploration (geology & geochemistry):**  Rhenium is almost exclusively hosted in molybdenite (MoS₂) within porphyry Cu–Mo deposits.  Exploration targets include high-level porphyry intrusions with potassic and phyllic alteration.  Sampling of stream sediments, soils, and rocks for Mo–Cu–W pathfinder elements indicates prospective areas.  Molymolybdenite typically carries Re at 10's to 1000's ppm【McCarthy et al., 2024】, with the highest values in Mo-rich systems.  
- **Geophysical surveys:**  Airborne magnetics and EM mapping highlight buried porphyry bodies.  Ground IP and resistivity surveys detect disseminated sulfide zones.  Deep magnetotelluric surveys image crustal structures controlling porphyry emplacement.  Integrating geophysics has successfully identified Re-bearing porphyries (e.g. Merlin in Australia, Climax in Colorado).  
- **Analytical methods:**  Modern exploration uses ICP–MS to analyze separated molybdenite grains for Re content.  Laser ablation ICP–MS can measure Re in situ in single grains.  Rhenium–Osmium geochronology provides age dating as well as Re concentration data.  Portable XRF tools do not detect Re directly, but Mo anomalies from pXRF can flag samples for follow-up lab analysis.  

- **Example deposits:**  The Henderson (CO) porphyry contains molybdenite averaging a few hundred ppm Re.  Utah’s Bingham Canyon porphyry molybdenites average ~250 ppm Re.  These examples show that U.S. porphyries carry appreciable Re if recovered (though currently none is captured)【McCarthy et al., 2024】.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: molybdenite roasting with stack gas capture; pressure oxidation leaching; flue dust recovery*  

- **Molybdenite roasting (pyrometallurgy):**  Conventional processing oxidizes concentrated MoS₂ at 550–650°C in multiple-hearth or fluidized-bed roasters.  Rhenium volatilizes as Re₂O₇ (sublimes at ~360°C) along with sulfur dioxide.  Flue gases are quenched or scrubbed in water or dilute H₂SO₄, dissolving the Re₂O₇ into perrhenic acid (HReO₄).  Well-operated roasters with efficient scrubbing can capture on the order of 70–85% of contained Re. Modern designs and better control of temperature and gas flow are key.  Any Re bypassing the scrubber remains in dust or is lost to the stack.  
- **Pressure oxidation (hydrometallurgy):**  An alternative is autoclave leaching.  Mo concentrate slurry is oxidized with oxygen at ~200–230°C and 30–35 bar.  This converts MoS₂ to soluble molybdates and dissolves Re as perrhenate (ReO₄⁻).  Kennecott’s patented autoclave process, for example, recovers essentially all the Re into solution【Kennecott, 2000】.  The loaded solution can then be purified to produce ammonium perrhenate.  Autoclave methods avoid losses as fumes, but require high-pressure equipment and downstream separation of Mo and Re.  
- **Copper smelter recovery:**  Rhenium in Cu concentrates reports mostly to smelter slag and flue dust.  Flash smelters produce SO₂-rich off-gas, but typical capture of Re is low (<30%) unless dedicated recovery is installed.  Recovering Re from Cu smelter dusts requires additional scrubbers and processing (e.g. similar to Mo-roaster scrubbing) but is generally marginal for plant designs.  
- **Catalyst recovery:**  Spent platinum–rhenium reforming catalysts are recycled industrially.  A common route is controlled oxidation of the spent catalyst at 500–600°C to volatilize Re, which is then captured in caustic or acidic scrubbers as perrhenate.  Alternatively, caustic or acid leaching (e.g. caustic fusion) dissolves Re directly.  These processes typically achieve 85–95% Re recovery from the spent catalyst material.  

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: ammonium perrhenate precipitation; ion exchange resins; solvent extraction with amines*  

- **Ammonium perrhenate precipitation:**  From perrhenic acid solutions, Re is commonly recovered as ammonium perrhenate (APR, NH₄ReO₄).  The solution is neutralized with ammonia to about pH 7–8, where APR has a solubility minimum.  At ~20°C, APR crystallizes out efficiently, often recovering >95% of the Re【Kennecott, 2000】.  The crystals (69.4% Re by weight) are washed and dried to >99.9% purity.  
- **Ion exchange:**  Strong-base anion exchange resins (e.g. quaternary ammonium-type resins like Amberlite IRA-400) selectively adsorb perrhenate (ReO₄⁻) from dilute solutions.  Such resins can load many tens to hundreds of grams of Re per liter of resin.  Elution with concentrated NH₄OH or NH₄SCN yields a purified Re solution, which is then precipitated as APR.  Ion exchange is especially useful for very low-grade or complex leachates with <10 mg/L Re.  
- **Solvent extraction:**  Tertiary amine solvents (e.g. trioctylamine, Alamine 336) extract perrhenate from acidic solutions.  Re distribution coefficients can exceed 100 under optimized conditions (pH ~1–2).  Stripping the loaded organic with ammonia or NaOH brings Re back to water for APR crystallization.  Solvent extraction provides an alternative to ion exchange for concentrating and purifying Re from solutions containing molybdenum and other metals.  
- **Emerging membrane methods:**  Nanofiltration and reverse-osmosis membranes can concentrate dilute perrhenate solutions.  Supported liquid membranes using quaternary ammonium carriers also show promise for selective Re transport.  These emerging techniques could enable recovering Re from very low-grade sources or unusually dilute streams, though they are not yet widely implemented commercially.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: hydrogen reduction at 1000°C; powder metallurgy; electron beam melting; CVD*  

- **Hydrogen reduction:**  Ammonium perrhenate is thermally decomposed and reduced in a hydrogen atmosphere at ~900–1100°C to yield metallic Re powder.  The single-stage reaction is (NH₄)ReO₄ → Re + N₂ + 4 H₂O.  In practice, multi-stage rotary or continuous furnaces with controlled H₂ flow are used.  The result is Re powder at ~99.5–99.95% purity with controlled particle size (typical powder is 1–10 μm).  Crucial parameters include precise temperature control and gas flow to avoid overheating or incomplete reduction.  
- **Powder consolidation:**  The Re powder is consolidated by hot or cold methods.  Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at 1800–2000°C under ~100–200 MPa yields nearly fully dense Re billets.  Powder may also be uniaxially pressed and vacuum-assisted sintered at ~2400–2800°C.  Cold rolling and annealing of consolidated powder allows production of Re sheet and foil.  Powder metallurgy avoids melting Re at its very high melting point (3186°C) until very late in the process.  
- **Electron-beam melting:**  For ultra-high-purity Re (5N, 99.999%), electron beam melting in vacuum is used.  Re bars are melted by an electron beam at 10⁻³–10⁻⁵ Pa; multiple melt passes remove volatile impurities.  This yields single-crystal or large-grained Re for specialty applications.  Inert-atmosphere arc melting is a lower-cost alternative for alloying Re with other metals (e.g. in Ni–Re superalloys).  
- **Chemical vapor deposition (CVD):**  Ultra-pure Re coatings and filaments are made by CVD.  Gaseous precursors like ReF₆ or ReCl₅ are decomposed on hot substrates (~400–800°C), depositing metallic Re.  This gives very high purity (>99.999%) Re films for electronics, X-ray targets, and catalytic supports.  

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: adsorption; chemical precipitation; biological treatment; waste immobilization*  

- **Adsorption:**  Contaminated waters and effluents can be treated by adsorptive media.  Activated carbon, alumina, or hydrated iron oxides effectively bind perrhenate.  Bio-adsorption using fungal and algal biomass (e.g. *Aspergillus*, *Penicillium*, *Chlorella*) has been shown to remove 70–90% of Re from dilute solutions【Belda, 2024】.  Modified biopolymers like chitosan can selectively capture Re at <mg/L levels.  These methods can polish process wastewater to <1 mg/L Re before discharge.  
- **Chemical precipitation:**  Re(VII) in solution can be reduced/precipitated.  Iron(II) or zero-valent iron reduces perrhenate to insoluble Re(IV) or Re-sulfide species, which precipitate with iron hydroxide【Belda, 2024】.  Similarly, adding BaCl₂ to concentrated perrhenate solutions yields barium perrhenate precipitate.  Such treatments can remove >95% of dissolved Re from point sources (e.g. scrubber liquors).  
- **Biological treatment:**  Sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g. *Desulfovibrio* species) use ReO₄⁻ as a terminal electron acceptor under anaerobic conditions, precipitating Re₂S₇.  Constructed wetlands supporting these microbes can passively remove Re from drainage.  Freshwater algae also bioaccumulate Re, with bioconcentration factors >1000 reported.  Research into genetically or biochemically enhanced Re uptake is ongoing.  
- **Waste stabilization:**  Solidification of Re-bearing wastes prevents leaching.  Spent catalysts or roasting residues can be mixed into cement or geopolymer matrices to lock in Re.  Vitrification of Re salts (forming borosilicate glass) is another option for long-term disposal.  These immobilization methods are used to ensure that catalysis and process wastes do not release Re to the environment.

The bottleneck summary and data above are supported by recent industry and technical sources.  For example, McCarthy *et al.* (2024) provides a comprehensive life–cycle analysis showing very low current Re recovery rates and geological limits【McCarthy et al., 2024】.  U.S. production/consumption figures are available from the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries and industry reports【Belda, 2024】【Willing, 2025】.  Reviews of Re processing (e.g. in the *Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry* and metallurgical journals) detail the roasting, leaching, and recovery chemistries.  Patents from Kennecott (2000) and others describe autoclave and solvent extraction processes【Kennecott, 2000】.  Environmental studies highlight Re removal by adsorption and biotechnologies.  (Key references include U.S. government statistics, peer-reviewed metallurgy articles, and technical market reports【McCarthy et al., 2024】【Belda, 2024】【Willing, 2025】【Kennecott, 2000】.)

## Key Bottleneck summary
The most critical bottleneck in U.S. and allied rhenium supply is the **absence of domestic molybdenite roasting facilities with Re recovery circuits**.  Although U.S. mines produce Re-bearing MoS₂, the concentrates are shipped abroad, so the recoverable Re is forfeited.  Current technology only captures a fraction of the metal – on the order of <12% of the Re present in ore【McCarthy et al., 2024】 – meaning 75–85% is lost in flue gases or residues.  Without major investment in domestic processing (or breakthrough low-grade recovery methods), the U.S. and its allies will remain heavily import-dependent, despite soaring demand.
