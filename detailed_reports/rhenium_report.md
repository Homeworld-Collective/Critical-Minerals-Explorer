## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **Primary production**: There are **no domestic rhenium mines** in the US or allied countries (US, Canada, Australia, EU, Norway, Iceland, Japan) – all domestic “production” must come from byproduct recovery or recycling.  In fact, authoritative sources note zero active US rhenium mines (USGS) and list US “production” (~8.87 t in 2022 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1312513/rhenium-production-volume-worldwide-by-country/#:~:text=Chile%20produced%20approximately%2032,87%20metric%20tons%20that%20year))) only to reflect byproducts from foreign operations.  Likewise, Canada, Australia and EU nations have no primary Re output; any Rhenium in domestic ores remains untapped.  
• **Secondary (recycling) production**: All allied Rhenium output today comes from recycling and reprocessing of scrap or spent catalysts.  The US and Germany are the **world’s leading secondary producers** ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/705659796/Mineral-Comodity-Summary-2024#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20and%20Germany,There%20were)), recovering Re from nickel-base superalloy scrap (turbine blades, engine parts) and spent petrochemical catalysts.  Industry sources estimate U.S. recycling capacity at **18–20 tons per year** ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/705659796/Mineral-Comodity-Summary-2024#:~:text=insufficient%20to%20make%20U,There%20were)); in 2023 the combined global secondary output was only ~25,000 kg (~25 t) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/705659796/Mineral-Comodity-Summary-2024#:~:text=insufficient%20to%20make%20U,There%20were)).  Other allied contributors include specialized refiners in Japan, Canada and France, though each processes only small volumes.  For example, Germany’s Buss & Buss Spezialmetalle operates processes to recycle rhenium-bearing superalloy and sputter-target scrap into pure Re and its compounds ([www.buss-spezialmetalle.de](https://www.buss-spezialmetalle.de/metal-scrap-recycling/rhenium-recycling/?lang=en#:~:text=Which%20rhenium%20scrap%20can%20be,recycled)).  In summary, **US/allied “production” is on the order of tens of tons per year (from recycling)**, with essentially **0 t/yr from domestic mining** ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1312513/rhenium-production-volume-worldwide-by-country/#:~:text=Chile%20produced%20approximately%2032,87%20metric%20tons%20that%20year)) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/705659796/Mineral-Comodity-Summary-2024#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20and%20Germany,There%20were)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Aerospace superalloys (≈75% of demand)**: The dominant use of Re is in high-temperature jet-engine alloys.  Major engine makers (GE Aviation, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Safran) continue ramping production of advanced turbine engines (e.g. GE9X, PW1000G) for commercial and military aircraft.  These use rhenium-enhanced superalloys (e.g. CMSX-4, René alloys) at ~3–6 wt% Re.  Industry reporting notes aerospace accounts for roughly **75% of global rhenium demand** ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2639672-viewpoint-japan-to-continue-filling-bulk-scrap-demand#:~:text=the%20annual%20primary%20production%20of,chromium%20alloys%20used%20in)).  With global air travel and new engine programs growing, US and allied aerospace demand for Re will rise.  For example, if global rhenium consumption grows ~7–8%/yr (per market forecasts ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/01/3125937/0/en/Metal-Rhenium-Market-Outlook-Report-2025-2034-Governments-Recognize-Rhenium-as-Critical-Driving-Market-Growth-and-Supply-Security-Initiatives.html#:~:text=The%20Metal%20Rhenium%20Market%20size,forecasts%20in%20our%20comprehensive%20report))) from today’s ~70–80 t, US/European/Japanese aerospace consumption could reach several tens of tons annually by 2030.  
• **Petrochemical catalysts**: Rhenium is used in platinum-rhenium reforming catalysts for high-octane fuel production.  This sector is mature and steady, contributing only ~20% of demand.  US policy shifts (e.g. higher oil refining rates) may keep this demand level flat; no large growth is expected.  Still, catalysts require ~1–3 t/yr of Re for US/refinery use.  
• **Medical and other emerging uses**: New high-performance alloys are entering the medical market.  Notably, a **Mo–50%Re alloy** was FDA-approved (2024) for implants (stents, joint prostheses), driving **projected demand of ~10–20 t** over the next 2–4 years in North America ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/pt/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2622603-rhenium-deficit-persists-could-boost-recycling#:~:text=Another%20significant%20new%20global%20driver,years%2C%20depending%20on%20the%20source)).  While small today, medical devices could consume a few tons by 2030.  Other minor uses (electronics, superplastic forming, semiconductors) add a few percent more.  
• **2030 demand estimate**: Combining these drivers, US/allied consumption by 2030 is expected to be on the order of **tens of metric tons per year**.  For illustration, if US demand (≈23 t in 2023) grows ~7–8% annually ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/01/3125937/0/en/Metal-Rhenium-Market-Outlook-Report-2025-2034-Governments-Recognize-Rhenium-as-Critical-Driving-Market-Growth-and-Supply-Security-Initiatives.html#:~:text=The%20Metal%20Rhenium%20Market%20size,forecasts%20in%20our%20comprehensive%20report)), the US alone could use ~40 t by 2030.  Adding allied usage (European and Japanese aerospace and industrial users) yields a total in the **40–60 t/yr range**.  All such estimates emphasize that demand is rising strongly due to aerospace and new medical applications ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/pt/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2622603-rhenium-deficit-persists-could-boost-recycling#:~:text=Global%20rhenium%20demand%20is%20expected,although%20they%20have%20since%20stabilised)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2639672-viewpoint-japan-to-continue-filling-bulk-scrap-demand#:~:text=the%20annual%20primary%20production%20of,chromium%20alloys%20used%20in)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Recycling expansion**: Domestic supply will rely almost entirely on recycling and recovery.  Existing recycling infrastructure (≈25 t/yr worldwide ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/705659796/Mineral-Comodity-Summary-2024#:~:text=insufficient%20to%20make%20U,There%20were))) would need to roughly double to meet 2030 demand.  Potential new programs (e.g. aerospace maintenance shops collecting used blades, petrochemical catalyst recyclers ramping up) could push US/EU/Japan recycling output toward **30–40 t/yr by 2030**.  For example, companies like Materion (USA) and Buss & Buss (Germany) are expanding reclamation to capture more Re from spent alloys ([www.buss-spezialmetalle.de](https://www.buss-spezialmetalle.de/metal-scrap-recycling/rhenium-recycling/?lang=en#:~:text=Which%20rhenium%20scrap%20can%20be,recycled)).  However, without large new investments, allied recycling is unlikely to exceed this level.  
• **Byproduct from Mo/Cu mining**: The only way to increase primary supply would be new molybdenum or copper projects in allied countries.  Currently no such projects exist (no US or other allied Mo/Cu mines with Re).  Unless new mine scopes (e.g. a North American porphyry deposit) are funded, this source is zero.  Thus, allied supply remains pegged to scrap streams.  
• **Shortfall and imports**: In practice, the US and allies will remain net importers.  Allied refiners will supplement domestic recovery with imports of refined Re (e.g. ammonium perrhenate or metal) from friendly producers.  Recent trade data show US imported ~50–60% of its Re from Canada, Germany, Poland, KZ ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/705659796/Mineral-Comodity-Summary-2024#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20apparent%20consumption%20in,in%202023%20compared%20with%20those)).  By 2030, with domestic recycling reaching only ~30–40 t against ~60 t demand, about half of US/allied needs will still rely on imports or scrap shipments from ally countries.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Porphyry exploration (geology & geochemistry)**: Rhenium is overwhelmingly associated with copper–molybdenum porphyry deposits (in molybdenite mineralization).  Exploration focuses on identifying porphyry copper–moly systems via geologic mapping (alteration zones, intrusive bodies) and geochemical sampling.  Stream-sediment or soil assays for Mo and Cu help flag targets (any anomalous molybdenite will carry Re at trace levels).  Hydrothermal alteration minerals (e.g. sericite, chlorite) detected by remote sensing or airborne magnetics can guide toward Re-bearing centers.  
• **Geophysical surveys**: Airborne magnetics and gravity surveys delineate the size and structure of porphyry complexes.  Induced polarization (IP) and resistivity surveys on the ground can detect deep sulfide zones (potential Mo/Re hosts).  Such methods helped discover numerous Re-bearing molybdenum deposits (e.g. porphyry Mo targets in North America and Europe).  
• **Analytical methods (in drilling)**: Once a porphyry system is intercepted, core samples are assayed with high-sensitivity methods (ICP-MS, GD-MS) for Rhenium.  Laser ablation ICP-MS can measure Re directly in molybdenite to estimate extend.  Geochemical trends in drill cores (e.g. increasing Re with depth in ore) can indicate rich sections.  
• **Example**: The Chilean El Teniente porphyry (largest Mo mine) contains 0.01% Re in molybdenite. No Re discovery is standalone – it comes from Mo discovery. Allied explorers use Cu/Mo exploration techniques as the “discovery” method for potential Re sources.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Molybdenite roasting (pyrometallurgy)**: Crushed molybdenite concentrate (MoS₂) is oxidized in a high-temperature roaster (fluidized-bed or rotary).  Under these conditions, ReS₂ in the concentrate oxidizes and volatilizes as rhenium heptoxide (Re₂O₇) gas, mixed with SO₂.  This off-gas is then passed through scrubbers (alkaline baths) to capture Re as perrhenic acid (HReO₄).  Typical Re recovery from roasting can exceed 65–85%, depending on roaster design ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00392-0#:~:text=%28Blossom%201985%20%29,48)).  
• **Pressure leaching (hydrometallurgy)**: Alternatively, oxidizing pressure-leach autoclaves (with O₂ or H₂SO₄ at high P/T) are used to dissolve Mo concentrates (especially low-grade ones). Rhenium goes into solution as perrhenate during the leach.  The resulting pregnant solution (mix of molybdenum and rhenium) is filtered.  This process similarly yields a dilute perrhenic acid solution, which is treated as above ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00392-0#:~:text=%28Blossom%201985%20%29,48)).  
• **Copper-smelter recovery**: In some cases, copper concentrates containing Mo (or little Re) are roasted in a flash furnace. A fraction of Re will oxidize and pass through flue systems.  Allied smelters (e.g. Kidd, Timok) can install flue-gas scrubbing circuits to capture this Re.  However, most recovery is optimized in dedicated Mo-processing facilities.  
• **Waste-catalyst digestion**: Spent reforming catalysts (alumina pellets loaded with Pt-Re) are chipped and roasted or acid-leached.  Re is oxidized to Re₂O₇ (pyrolyzed) or dissolved (acid), similar to above, then captured in solution.  This lifestyle board recycles Re from petroleum industry wastes.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **APR precipitation (ammonium perrhenate)**: The perrhenic acid solution from roasting/leaching is neutralized with ammonia or ammonium compounds to precipitate ammonium perrhenate (NH₄ReO₄) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00392-0#:~:text=parent%20metal%20ore%3A%20Re%20is,of%20Re%20from%20sulfides%2C%20though)).  APR crystals (typically containing 30–50% Re) form and are filtered out.  This is the main method of concentrating Re from dilute solutions.  
• **Ion-exchange and adsorption**: Anion-exchange resins (quaternary ammonium or strong-base resin) can selectively absorb perrhenate ions from large volumes.  Re is then eluted with salt solution to produce a concentrated Re stream for APR crystallization.  Likewise, selective inorganic adsorbents (alumina, activated carbon, or functional polymers) can capture trace Re from effluents prior to acid-side recovery.  
• **Solvent extraction**: Although less common (due to Re’s high value and low volumes), some processes use organic extractants (e.g. alamine or phosphine oxides) to pull Re out of solution.  For example, rhenium can be loaded into solvent then stripped to a small aqueous phase.  These are generally pilot-scale or used when coupling with other metals.  
• **Direct precipitation/elution**: In some refineries, Re is flocculated with a heavy-metal co-precipitate (e.g. adding ferric chloride to co-precipitate Re).  Alternatively, Bolton and Isaacs processes (rare) embed Re on polymeric precipitates.  Electrowinning (cathodic deposition) of Re metal from Cr-free perrhenate solutions is also technically possible but not widely commercialized.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Hydrogen reduction of APR**: Ammonium perrhenate is thermally treated in hydrogen at 400–600 °C to yield metallic rhenium powder and release NH₃/H₂O ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00392-0#:~:text=parent%20metal%20ore%3A%20Re%20is,of%20Re%20from%20sulfides%2C%20though)).  This produces fine Re powder (~99.9% pure) but still containing minor oxides.  The powder is collected in vacuum pans.  
• **Vacuum melting**: The rhenium powder (often briquetted) is melted in vacuum arc or electron-beam furnaces (Re mp ~3,180 °C).  This produces dense ingots or pellets of high-purity Re (99.97+%).  Multiple meltings (remelt/ zone-refining) are used to remove tramp impurities (e.g. Mo, Fe). Typical final producers include metal spheres or wires: e.g. Heraeus or Plansee manufacture Re powder, pellets, wire by successive melting.  
• **Powder metallurgy**: An alternative path: Re powder from APR can be alloyed or sintered without full melting.  Specialized HIP (hot isostatic pressing) consolidates Re powder into billets.  Some manufacturers add Ni to make W-Re or Mo-Re alloys at lower temperatures.  
• **Chemical reduction**: Lab methods (e.g. ReCl₅ reduction with H₂) exist but not used at scale.  Instead, large-scale operations rely on the APR route and vacuum melting for final refinement.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Effluent treatment (adsorption/ion-exchange)**: Treatment of industrial wastewater or mine drainage containing traces of Re uses adsorbents or ion exchange.  For example, yeast biomass (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) has been shown to remove ~75–84% of Re from acidic effluents ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8400443/#:~:text=Treatment%20of%20Rhenium,The)).  Functionalized polymers or metal-oxides (e.g. activated alumina, chitosan gels) can similarly adsorb perrhenate.  These capture residual Re before discharge.  
• **Co-precipitation and pH adjustment**: Raising pH to ~5–7 in a riverine/pond setting precipitates iron and manganese oxyhydroxides, which co-throw down Re as ReO₄⁻ is adsorbed.  Addition of iron salts (Fe²⁺/Fe³⁺) can chemically immobilize Re in tailings ponds.  Such bulk methods mitigate contamination from moly-roaster scrubbers or spent catalysts.  
• **Catalyst recycling**: Spent hydrocarbon reformer catalysts (containing Pt-Re) are not landfilled in allied countries.  They undergo chemical leaching or smelting to remove precious metals.  Research (e.g. acid leach and solvent extraction) is evolving to recover remaining Re from regenerated catalyst materials, preventing its release into process waste.  
• **Mine waste reprocessing**: For potential rhenium in tailings, some groups study re-mining historic dumps.  One method is bioleaching: using fungi or bacteria (e.g. _Scenedesmus_ algae) to solubilize trace Re from tailings, then re-extract by precipitation.  These specialized methods are under investigation to address legacy Re losses.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• The chief bottleneck is **inefficient recovery of Re from ore and lack of ore supply**.  As shown by recent analyses, **<12% of Rhenium in mined U.S./Allied ore is captured** by current processing ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00392-0#:~:text=material%2C%20including%20through%20international%20trade,copper%20and%20molybdenum%20host%20ores)).  Even with ideal process improvements, technical limits suggest at most ~30–40% yield.  In practice, most Re remains in tailings or is lost.  Coupled with no domestic Mo/Cu mines, this poor extraction efficiency is the principal constraint on U.S./allied production.  All allied Re “production” thus hinges on recycling scrap—in effect capping supply.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Overall, the **most critical bottleneck** in U.S. and allied rhenium supply is the inherently low capture of Re from host ores ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13563-023-00392-0#:~:text=material%2C%20including%20through%20international%20trade,copper%20and%20molybdenum%20host%20ores)).  With no domestic primary deposits, even doubling recycling capacity will only skim a fraction of demand.  In short, without new ore sources or breakthrough recovery technologies, allied production remains limited to recycling levels far below projected 2030 demand.
