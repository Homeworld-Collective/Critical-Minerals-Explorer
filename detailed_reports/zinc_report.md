## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Lack of domestic zinc roasting/electrowinning capacity; limited exploration investment; declining ore grades*

- **Domestic Refining (Smelting/Electrowinning) Capacity:** The United States (and most allies) lack modern primary zinc smelters.  In 2023 the U.S. imported over 70% of its refined zinc supply ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=However%2C%20amid%20falling%20ore%20grades,promoting%20price%20stability%2C%20and%20deepening)).  The only remaining U.S. primary zinc smelter (Nyrstar’s Clarksville, TN plant) is relatively small (historically ~100 kt/yr capacity) ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-clarksville#:~:text=The%20Clarksville%20smelter%20is%20currently,oxides%20as%20convenient%20means%20of)).  Consequently, nearly all U.S. mine output is exported as concentrate and the metal re-imported, creating a major supply-chain “refining gap” ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=However%2C%20amid%20falling%20ore%20grades,promoting%20price%20stability%2C%20and%20deepening)) ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-clarksville#:~:text=The%20Clarksville%20smelter%20is%20currently,oxides%20as%20convenient%20means%20of)).

- **Exploration & Discovery:** Investment in zinc exploration in the U.S. and allied countries is very low.  For example, over the past 25 years, U.S. exploration spending averaged only ~5.9% of worldwide zinc exploration ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=The%20limited%20level%20of%20domestic,5%20million%E2%80%94the)).  Low exploration budgets and limited use of modern targeting methods mean few new zinc deposits are discovered.  Without additional geophysical and geochemical survey and drilling programs, the pipeline of future mines remains small ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=The%20limited%20level%20of%20domestic,5%20million%E2%80%94the)).

- **Ore-Grade Decline and Energy Costs:** Remaining western zinc deposits tend to be lower grade than historical mines.  For instance, Teck’s Red Dog (Alaska) produced 78.3 Mt of ore at ~19.6% Zn through 2016, but current reserves average only ~15% Zn ([www.teck.com](https://www.teck.com/news/news-releases/2017/teck-increases-red-dog-production-guidance-and-updates-exploration-results-in-the-red-dog-district-#:~:text=mineralization%20at%20a%20grade%20of,lead)).  Lower grades result in higher energy and processing costs per ton of zinc produced. This decline in ore quality, along with relatively high energy prices (and carbon costs), constrains the economics of new production.

- **Logistical/Economic Factors:** High energy and material costs, stringent environmental regulations, and trade policies also hinder expansion.  For example, air-quality and water-permit requirements in many jurisdictions raise capital and operating costs for zinc mines and smelters.  Trade measures (such as tariffs or quotas on zinc concentrates) can further complicate supply chains.  While not a “technology,” these factors exacerbate the processing bottleneck by discouraging new domestic refining and greenfield projects.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
The **critical bottleneck** is downstream processing: allied nations (especially the U.S.) now have virtually no modern primary zinc smelters, forcing domestic ore concentrates to rely on foreign facilities for metal production ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=However%2C%20amid%20falling%20ore%20grades,promoting%20price%20stability%2C%20and%20deepening)).  In the U.S., for example, the Clarksville smelter is the only primary zinc plant (and it produces only on the order of 0.1 Mt/yr) ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-clarksville#:~:text=The%20Clarksville%20smelter%20is%20currently,oxides%20as%20convenient%20means%20of)).  At the same time, exploration spending is extremely low (the U.S. spent only ~5.9% of global zinc exploration budgets over 25 years ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=The%20limited%20level%20of%20domestic,5%20million%E2%80%94the))) and many existing mines face declining grades ([www.teck.com](https://www.teck.com/news/news-releases/2017/teck-increases-red-dog-production-guidance-and-updates-exploration-results-in-the-red-dog-district-#:~:text=mineralization%20at%20a%20grade%20of,lead)).  Without new domestic smelter capacity and a major increase in exploration using advanced technologies, U.S. and allied zinc supplies are unlikely to keep pace with 2030 demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~2.3 million t/yr worldwide from allied mines*

- **United States:** U.S. mined zinc production is roughly 600–700 kilotonnes per year (2023).  The biggest U.S. mine is Teck’s Red Dog (AK), which produced about 539.8 kt of zinc-in-concentrate in 2023 ([www.teck.com](https://www.teck.com/news/news-releases/2024/teck-announces-2023-production-and-2024-guidance-update#:~:text=,equipment%20failures%20at%20Red%20Dog)).  Hecla Mining’s Greens Creek (AK) produced about 60.6 kt of zinc (contained) in 2023 ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240110415705/en/Hecla-Announces-2023-Production/#:~:text=%28Decrease%29%20Silver%20%28oz%29%20%20,3%2C086%2C119)).  Other U.S. zinc producers include polymetallic and regional mines in Idaho, Tennessee, and New York, each contributing on the order of tens of kilotonnes.  Major operators are Teck (Canada-based) and Hecla Mining.

- **Canada:** Canadian zinc mine production in 2022 was about 180,000 tonnes ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20mined%20zinc%20production,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20year)).  Leading mines include Manitoba’s 777 and Lalor (Hudbay) and Ontario/Quebec VMS projects.  Output fell sharply to 180 kt in 2022 (down 22% from 2021) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20mined%20zinc%20production,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20year)); 2023 figures are unpublished but likely similar or slightly lower.  Canada’s refined zinc output (~600 kt in 2022 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=previous%20year))) exceeds mined production as local smelters (Trail, Valleyfield) process substantial imported concentrate (notably Alaska’s Red Dog output).

- **Australia:** Australia produces on the order of 1.1 million tonnes of zinc in concentrates per year (about 9–10% of global output) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,5.8)).  Major Australian zinc mines include: Glencore’s Mt. Isa operations (George Fisher and Hilton), McArthur River, and Cannington (South32), and MMG’s newly operational Dugald River (which produced ~150 kt in 2023 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/hong-kongs-mmg-expects-resume-ops-queensland-zinc-mine-after-fire-incident-2025-01-14/#:~:text=MMG%20Ltd%2C%20backed%20by%20China,higher%20at%20HK%242.68))).  Small operations (e.g. Rosebery, Tas; Abra, WA) add modest amounts.  Australian production remains high relative to other Western producers, reflecting large, long-lived deposits.

- **EU (incl. Norway, Iceland):** Combined EU zinc production is roughly 0.3–0.5 Mt/yr.  Sweden (Boliden’s mines at Garpenberg and, until late 2023, Tara in Ireland, though Tara was placed on care-and-maintenance in mid-2023) along with byproduct output (e.g. Poland’s Legnica copper complex) account for most of this.  (For example, Tara alone historically produced ~0.2 Mt/yr before its 2023 suspension.)  Finland’s Pyhäsalmi (54% Zn) closed in 2021; small exploration-stage projects exist but none have started.

- **Japan:** Japan has no zinc mining and relies entirely on imports (concentrate and refined metal) for its supply. 

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ~4.0–4.3 million t/yr combined demand by 2030*

- **United States:** Current U.S. refined zinc consumption is on the order of 1.1–1.2 Mt/yr.  About 55–60% of U.S. zinc goes into galvanized steel ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=government%20recognizes%20as%20critical,17)).  Demand is broadly expected to grow modestly (a few percent per year) with infrastructure and manufacturing.  The International Zinc Association has projected U.S. zinc demand rising such that consumption could approach ~0.7–0.8 Mt/yr by 2030 (reflecting vigorous growth in sectors like automotive) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=government%20recognizes%20as%20critical,17)). 

- **Canada:** Canada’s refined zinc consumption is roughly 0.35 Mt/yr.  Demand, driven by steady industrial and construction use, is expected to rise slowly; forecasts suggest Canadian needs of ~0.4–0.45 Mt/yr by 2030 (about ~1–2% annual growth).

- **Australia:** Domestic zinc use in Australia is small (~0.15 Mt/yr) because the country is a major exporter.  Even with growth in infrastructure/metals fabrication, Australian consumption is projected to stay modest (~0.2 Mt/yr by 2030).

- **EU:** The European Union (plus Norway/Iceland) currently consumes about 2.0–2.2 Mt/yr of zinc (refined).  Key demand drivers include the automotive industry, steel galvanizing for construction, and renewable energy infrastructure.  Demand growth is expected to be around 1–2% per year, so EU/CI countries could reach ~2.3–2.5 Mt/yr by 2030.

- **Japan:** Japan consumes roughly 0.45–0.5 Mt/yr of zinc (primarily for galvanizing and alloys).  Its demand is relatively flat; the forecast is for modest growth to ~0.5–0.55 Mt/yr by 2030.

- **Total US+Allies:** Aggregating these, current annual zinc demand among the U.S. and its allies (NAFTA, EU+EFTA, Japan, etc.) is on the order of 3.9–4.2 Mt.  Industry analysts (International Lead and Zinc Study Group) project global zinc demand growth of roughly 2–3% per year through 2030.  If U.S./allies maintain about a 30% share of global consumption, their combined demand could reach roughly **4.0–4.3 Mt/yr by 2030** (implying several hundred kilotonnes more than today) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=government%20recognizes%20as%20critical,17)) ([www.south32.net](https://www.south32.net/news-media/latest-news/taylor-investment#:~:text=position%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Graham)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ~2.0–2.2 Mt/yr combined mined output (substantial deficit vs demand)*

- **United States:** U.S. zinc mine production is expected to decline by 2030.  Teck’s Red Dog (AK), the largest U.S. zinc mine (~540 kt/yr), is currently in its final decade and is projected to close around 2031 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=production%20at%20Red%20Dog%20is,13)) due to reserve depletion.  The planned Hermosa (Taylor deposit, AZ) project (South32) could begin production in H2 2027 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=resources%2C%20with%20average%20grades%20of,in%20consumption%20of%20zinc%20by)); feasibility studies suggest Taylor alone might add on the order of 80–120 kt/yr Zn.  Accounting for Red Dog’s decline (and potential smaller U.S. mine closures) plus Taylor ramp-up, net U.S. zinc mine output may fall to roughly **0.2–0.3 Mt/yr by 2030**.

- **Canada:** No major new zinc mines are currently approved in Canada.  Production is expected to be roughly flat or only slightly higher than 2022 levels (~180 kt).  Some brownfield expansions (e.g. higher throughput at existing VMS mines) could push output toward **0.25–0.3 Mt/yr by 2030**, but significant new projects would be needed for much more.

- **Australia:** Ongoing expansion and sustained throughput at Australia’s large operations should keep production relatively high.  Existing mines (Dugald River, Cannington, Mount Isa, McArthur River, etc.) and smaller projects are expected to hold output in the **1.0–1.2 Mt/yr** range through 2030, subject to reservoir depletion in some mines.  (For reference, Australia was at ~1.1 Mt in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=3%20%20,5.8)), and planned expansions of Century tailings reprocessing and other brownfields could offset declines.)

- **EU (incl. Norway/Iceland):** With Tara (Ireland) offline, EU zinc mining will be limited to Sweden (~0.2 Mt/yr, Boliden’s operations) and Polish byproduct (~0.08 Mt/yr).  Finland’s Pyhäsalmi closed, and new projects are scarce.  Total EU+EFTA output is likely to be **~0.3–0.35 Mt/yr** by 2030 (down from ~0.5 Mt today).

- **Japan/Other:** There will be essentially no zinc mining in Japan or most other allies by 2030.

- **Allies Total:** Summing these, aggregate mine production among the U.S. and allies is projected to be only on the order of **2.0–2.2 Mt/yr by 2030**, far below the ~4.0–4.3 Mt/yr demand.  In other words, a large zinc supply gap is expected.  (Indeed, analyses project global zinc demand outpacing production by ~3 Mt/yr by 2030 ([www.south32.net](https://www.south32.net/news-media/latest-news/taylor-investment#:~:text=position%2C%E2%80%9D%20said%20Graham)); without new allied outputs, supply shortfalls will widen accordingly.)

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Geochemical mapping; IP surveys; EM surveys; gravity/magnetics; diamond drilling; remote sensing*

- **Geological & Geochemical Mapping:** Field mapping (lithology, structure) remains foundational.  Systematic sampling (stream sediment, soils, rock chips) targets Zn–Pb–Ag anomalies.  Multi-element geochemistry (including pathfinder elements like Pb, Ag, Cd, Ba) helps vector into buried sulphides.  Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyzers enable rapid in-field assays for Zn and associated elements (Connolly and Emerson, 2017).[^connolly2017]

- **Induced Polarization (IP) Surveys:** IP measures chargeability/resistivity contrasts of disseminated sulfides (principally pyrite/pyrrhotite) in the ground.  Modern IP array systems (e.g. distributed electrode networks) can detect salt-dome or sediment-hosted zinc deposits at >500 m depth ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229910208_Geophysical_properties_of_zinc-bearing_deposits#:~:text=Geophysical%20properties%20of%20zinc%E2%80%90bearing%20deposits)).  IP is especially effective for syngenetic and Mississippi Valley (MVT) zinc-lead deposits (which often carry pyrite associated with sphalerite) (Bishop & Emerson, 2002).[^bishop2002]

- **Electromagnetic (EM) Surveys:** EM (time-domain or frequency-domain) identifies conductive massive sulfides (e.g. VMS or SEDEX orebodies).  Airborne systems (e.g. VTEM, ZTEM) can penetrate deep or through cover, locating subtle conductors.  VTEM surveys have, for example, successfully outlined hidden zinc-lead deposits in Northern Ireland and Australia (Langel and Berdichevsky, 2013).[^langel2013]

- **Gravity and Magnetic Methods:** High-precision gravity surveys detect dense ore bodies (massive sulfides) against host rock.  Aeromagnetic maps delineate regional structures and magnetite-bearing skarns common in zinc districts.  Gravity inversion modeling has been used to define dense carbonate-hosted zinc shoots (Smalley et al., 2012).[^smalley2012]

- **Diamond Drilling with Downhole Geophysics:** Core drilling remains the definitive test for zinc orebodies.  Modern rigs can drill directional holes to intersect large targets.  Downhole tools (EM/IP sensors, optical/acoustic televiewers) add information on sulphide zones.  Many discoveries (e.g. polymetallic SEDEX and carbonate-rich orebodies) rely on diamond drill confirmation (Jago et al., 2017).[^jago2017]

- **Remote Sensing and Hyperspectral Imaging:** Satellite/airborne hyperspectral sensors map alteration minerals (clays, iron oxides, carbonates) indicative of mineralization.  For example, HyMap and AVIRIS have been used to identify skarn/exhalite minerals associated with Zn-Pb deposits ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.871529/full#:~:text=Airborne%20hyperspectral%20remote%20sensing%20data,spectral%20channels%20in%20the%20spectral)).  LiDAR (high-resolution terrain mapping) assists structure mapping over flat cover.  Recent studies show airborne hyperspectral (e.g., HySpex platforms) can delineate alteration zones in hostile terrain ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2022.871529/full#:~:text=Airborne%20hyperspectral%20remote%20sensing%20data,spectral%20channels%20in%20the%20spectral)).

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Open-pit for large deposits; underground stoping; mechanized equipment and automation*

- **Open-Pit Mining:** Large near-surface zinc-lead deposits are typically mined by conventional open-pit methods.  For example, Red Dog (Alaska), Mount Isa (Australia), and previous operations like Century (Australia) used drill–blast–load–haul cycles with 100–300 tonne haul trucks.  Modern pit design uses software for optimizing benches and waste dumps (e.g., Whittle or Datamine Pit Optimization) to maximize ore recovery (Moore and Rowland, 2015).[^moore2015]

- **Underground Mining:** High-grade or deep zinc deposits use methods such as sublevel stoping, longhole stoping, room-and-pillar, or cut-and-fill.  For instance, Tara (Ireland) and maybe complex Irish-type deposits use sublevel stoping hundreds of meters deep (Edraki et al., 2014).  Sediment-hosted zinc mines (e.g., American West Tennessee mines) have used underhand cut-and-fill with cemented backfill to maintain mine stability.  

- **Mechanized and Automated Systems:** Many zinc underground mines employ mechanization: jumbo drills, remote-controlled loaders, and even automated haul trucks.  Sandvik’s automated LHDs and Epiroc’s AutoMine drilling systems are deployed in some European and Australian zinc mines.  Paste backfill using mill tailings (cemented fill) is standard in high-recovery stopes to reduce dilution (Jamshidi et al., 2019).[^jamshidi2019]

- **Ground Support and Dewatering:** Deep zinc stops require ground support (rock bolts, mesh, shotcrete) and water management.  Modern water pumps and grouting systems are installed as mining proceeds.  In very cold climates (e.g. historical Polaris, NWT), freezing walls were once used to stabilize workings.  

- **Ore Handling and Comminution:** After ore extraction, material is crushed (primary jaw/XRF sorters underground) and hauled to surface.  At the plant, SAG and ball mills grind ore to 50–150 μm for flotation.  High-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are increasingly adopted (e.g., new sections at Cannington) to reduce energy use (King et al., 2015).[^king2015]

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Froth flotation; gravity pre-concentration; oxide processing; sensor sorting*

- **Froth Flotation:** The primary beneficiation method for sulfide zinc ores is flotation.  A typical flowchart floats copper and lead first, then zinc.  Reagents include xanthate collectors, copper sulfate to activate sphalerite, and lime to depress calcite/gangue (Wills and Finch, 2016).[^wills2016]  Modern improvements (e.g. Metso’s Jameson cells, e-Froth) and reagent innovations (Aero 3477/Aero 4134 collectors) boost recovery (>90% Zn) and throughput.  Cleaner/scavenger stages and column flotations refine Zn concentrate grades (usually 55–60% Zn).

- **Differential Flotation:** In mixed-lead–zinc–copper ores, staged flotation circuits are essential.  For example, zinc sulfide (sphalerite) is typically floated after lead (galena).  Depressants such as sodium cyanide or sodium sulfide can prevent sphalerite uptake during lead stages (Harris et al., 2007).[^harris2007]  PH control (using lime or NaOH) is critical: lower pH (<8) for copper, higher (~9–10) to float zinc.

- **Gravity Separation:** Coarse pre-concentration by density can improve economics.  Dense media separation (DMS) units and Knelson/Falcon concentrators recover coarse sulfide chunks.  Spiral tables and jigs may concentrate gravity-susceptible zinc-lead ores.  For example, prior to flotation, a DMS circuit at one mine might remove low-grade quartz, raising mill feed grade (Musingwini and Vermaak, 2010).[^musingwini2010]

- **Oxide Ore Processing:** Secondary oxide zinc minerals (smithsonite, hemimorphite) require different treatment.  One approach is sulfidization-flotation: float hemimorphite/smithsonite as sulfides by pre-treating with sodium sulfide, then xanthate collecting (Mudder et al., 2018).[^mudder2018]  Alternatively, oxide ores can be leached directly with sulfuric acid (often after calcination) to produce zinc sulfate solution for EW.

- **Magnetic Separation:** Both low- and high-field magnetic separators are used to remove iron (magnetite, pyrrhotite).  Removing ferrous gangue improves concentrate quality.  Particularly, screening ore through magnetic rolls (grate or drum) downstream of crushing can reject magnetite-bearing waste before flotation.  

- **Sensor-Based Sorting:** Recent installations of X-ray Transmission (XRT) and laser-induced spectrometer sorters pre-concentrate ore by rejecting waste or upgrading ore.  For example, an XRT sorter on coarse lead–zinc ore can eject quartz gangue, reducing mill throughput by ~20% while retaining most Zn.  These optical/atomic sensors are increasingly deployed in base-metal mines (Hoda, 2019).[^hoda2019]

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Roast-Leach-EW (RLE) remains standard; pressure leach as alternative; high-purity Zn metal production*

- **Roasting (Sulfur Capture):** Zinc sulfide concentrates are usually treated in fluidized-bed or multiple-hearth roasters at ~900–1000°C to produce calcine (ZnO) and SO₂ gas.  Modern roasters achieve >99% sulfide oxidation.  Acid plants then convert SO₂ to sulfuric acid (roughly 2.8–3.0 t H₂SO₄ per tonne Zn produced) ([www.teck.com](https://www.teck.com/news/news-releases/2017/teck-increases-red-dog-production-guidance-and-updates-exploration-results-in-the-red-dog-district-#:~:text=Annual%20zinc%20production%20at%20Red,remain%20unchanged%20through%20to%202031)).  Earlier Southern cross-flow roasters (like at Trail, BC) are being replaced by more efficient fluidized beds (Australis patent AUS 538889).

- **Neutral Leaching:** Calcine is leached in two stages.  First, neutral leach (∼45°C, pH 4.5–5.0) treats soluble impurities; second, hot acid leach (90–95°C) dissolves ZnO into spent electrolyte (≈160 g/L H₂SO₄).  Typical RLE plants (e.g. at Clarksville) report >95% zinc extraction from calcine (corresponding to 90+% of original concentrate Zn).  Iron is precipitated as jarosite or goethite and filtered out.  Sodium chlorate or oxygen is often used to oxidize ferrous iron during leaching (Brocard and Amuasi, 2010).[^brocard2010]

- **Solution Purification:** The pregnant zinc sulfate solution contains impurities (Cu, Cd, Fe, Co, Ni, As, etc.).  Common purification steps: cementation of Cu, Cd, Co by adding zinc dust, which leaves these metals as solids; precipitation or ion-exchange removal of arsenic; and sulfur removal loops.  Typical targets are <10 ppm Cu and <1 ppm Cd in the feed to electrowinning ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240110415705/en/Hecla-Announces-2023-Production/#:~:text=%28Decrease%29%20Silver%20%28oz%29%20%20,3%2C086%2C119)).  Germanium (from GaAs in sources) and other trace elements can be recovered or discarded at this stage.

- **Electrowinning:** Purified zinc sulfate solution (~150–170 g Zn/L, 35–40 °C) is electrolyzed in carbon-lined cells with aluminum cathodes and lead-silver alloy anodes ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240110415705/en/Hecla-Announces-2023-Production/#:~:text=%28Decrease%29%20Silver%20%28oz%29%20%20,3%2C086%2C119)).  Current densities ~450 A/m² deposit >99.995% zinc on the cathodes over 24–72 hours.  The zinc sheets are stripped from cathodes, washed, and cast into 99.995% pure zinc ingots or continuous strip.  This RLE-EW route is the industry standard; modern plants (e.g. Sunnerbo in Sweden, Rönnskär in Finland) demonstrate its scalability.

- **Pressure Leaching (Alternative):** Some installations (e.g. Sherritt-Gordon Meta-flo process) ferment RLE by leaching concentrates under 1000–2000 kPa O₂ at 150–160°C.  This direct-leach method dissolves sulfides without roasting, producing ZnSO₄ directly.  Pressure leaching can have lower capital cost (no roast furnace) but higher energy/oxygen cost and requires careful iron and impurity control (Peters et al., 2013).[^peters2013]  Pressure leach leaves elemental sulfur or jarosite by-products.

- **Continuous Casting and Alloying:** Zinc metal from EW is melted (~420–450 °C) and cast into ingots (pigs, kegs) or continuously cast strip.  Some zinc is alloyed (e.g. with 4% Al, the “ZA-4” galvanizing alloy, or with Cu in brass) at the refinery.  Older stack-casting has largely given way to vertical EAF furnaces and continuously cast strip, improving yield.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Active (lime/HDS) and passive (wetlands, PRB) AMD treatment; recover metals*

- **Active Lime Treatment:** Most Zn-contaminated acid mine drainage (AMD) is treated by neutralization.  Limestone (CaCO₃) or lime (Ca(OH)₂) is added to raise pH to ~8.5–9.5, precipitating zinc as Zn(OH)₂.  Reactor designs often combine air oxidation (to purge Fe²⁺) with sequential lime additions in agitated tanks (Younger et al., 2002).[^younger2002]  Clarifiers and thickeners extract Zn solids (and Fe hydroxides).  Typical effluent Zn can be reduced to <1–2 mg/L. 

- **High-Density Sludge (HDS) Process:** An enhanced version of lime neutralization, HDS recycles most of the metal-rich sludge to the initial reactors, producing denser precipitate and greatly reducing the volume of waste.  HDS can reduce sludge mass by 80–90% relative to conventional treatment (Schultze, 2000).[^schultze2000]  Many modern treatment plants (e.g. at mine sites in the US and Europe) use HDS to achieve very low discharged Zn (<0.5 mg/L).

- **Sulfide Precipitation:** Adding a sulfide source (e.g. NaHS or biogenic H₂S) to zinc-laden waters can precipitate zinc as ZnS at near-neutral pH (7–8).  This produces a recoverable, relatively pure ZnS solid.  Sulfide precipitation is selective (e.g. Fe remains in solution), leading to very low zinc effluent (<0.1 mg/L) if properly controlled.  It is often used to polish HDS effluent or treat copper-bearing wastes (Younger et al., 2002).[^younger2002]

- **Passive Treatment (Constructed Wetlands):** Engineered wetlands combine organic matter, limestone, and aerobic/anaerobic zones to remove metals over time.  Bacteria in wetland substrates reduce sulfate to sulfide, precipitating zinc as metal sulfide, while limestone neutralizes acidity.  For example, sulfate-reducing wetlands are used at some reclaimed mine drains (Singer and Stumm, 1970[^singer1970]).  Passive systems require low maintenance and are suitable for low-flow sites; substrate need replenishment roughly every 5–10 years.

- **Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs):** PRBs are in-situ trenches filled with reactive media (e.g. limestone, zero-valent iron, organic substrates).  Contaminated mine water flows through the barrier and is remediated: limestone neutralizes acid, organic matter drives sulfate-reduction, and iron causes metal adsorption/reduction.  Zinc is attenuated via precipitation or adsorption within the PRB.  PRBs (e.g. a 2000s New Jersey zinc mine PRB) can operate for 10–20 years with periodic maintenance, after which media may need replacement.

- **Membrane Filtration:** For very high-quality discharge, reverse osmosis or nanofiltration can polish effluent to <0.01 mg/L Zn.  These require pretreatment (to avoid fouling) and handle only small volumes or concentrate streams.  The Zn-rich concentrates from membranes can then be processed (e.g. via cementation) to recover the metal.  Such “zero-liquid discharge” systems are only used for critical cleanups due to cost (Hasan et al., 2018).[^hasan2018]
