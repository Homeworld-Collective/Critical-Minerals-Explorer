## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** On the order of ~750,000 t/year (2023), from ~15 active mines ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=2%20%20,5.8)). The largest U.S. zinc mine is Teck’s Red Dog (Alaska), which produced ~555,600 t in 2024 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Dog%20operates%20profitably%2C%20with%20total,12%7D%C2%A0Nearby%20deposits%20are%20being%20explored)). Other producers include Hecla Mining’s Greens Creek (AK) and Lucky Friday (ID) and historical Pend Oreille (WA) (Teck) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/zinc-in-the-us/#:~:text=Leading%20producers%20of%20zinc%20in,Mining%27s%20output%20increased%20by%2012)) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Dog%20operates%20profitably%2C%20with%20total,12%7D%C2%A0Nearby%20deposits%20are%20being%20explored)). Major U.S. zinc operators are Teck Resources (Canada-based) and Hecla ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/zinc-in-the-us/#:~:text=Leading%20producers%20of%20zinc%20in,Mining%27s%20output%20increased%20by%2012)).  
• **Canada:** Mined production ~180,000 t in 2022 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20mined%20zinc%20production,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20year)) (dropping ~22% from 2021). Principal Canadian zinc mines are in Ontario and Quebec (e.g. Matagami, Brucejack) and smaller co-product operations. Refined zinc metal output was much higher (~600,000 t in 2022 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=Estimated%20refined%20zinc%20metal%20production,from%20Alaska%20to%20British%20Columbia))) because smelters (BC, QC) also process imported concentrate (notably from Alaska).  
• **Australia:** ~1,100,000 t in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=2%20%20,6.3)) (9.2% of world output). Major mines include New Century/Dugald River (ZN, Qld), McArthur River and Mount Isa (Glencore), and Cannington (BHP/South32; a Pb–Zn–Ag mine). Australian output continues growth versus other Western producers.  
• **EU (incl. Norway, Iceland):** Relatively small. Sweden produced ~220,000 t in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=4%20%20,4.1)) (Boliden’s Aitik and Garpenberg mines). Ireland’s Tara Mine (Boliden) historically produced ~150–250 kt/yr of zinc concentrate (until care-and-maintenance in 2024). Poland’s KGHM (Cu mines) yields several hundred kt Pb–Zn as byproduct, but current figures are volatile. Norway and Iceland have negligible zinc mining (Rønnskär Norway operates a smelter but no primary mine).  
• **Japan:** Essentially no domestic zinc mining; Japan relies almost entirely on imports of concentrates or metal ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=2%20%20,5.8)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** U.S. zinc consumption (refined metal used) is roughly production plus net imports (≈0.75 Mt + ~0.60 Mt imported in 2024 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=United%20States%20remains%20heavily%20dependent,on%20Canada%20and%20Mexico%20as)) ≈0.8 Mt). U.S. demand is forecast to grow with infrastructure and manufacturing. Galvanized steel use (≈60% of Zn demand) is projected to increase ~6.9% annually ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=The%20demand%20for%20galvanized%20steel,cables%2C%20and%20substations%20made%20of)), implying U.S. zinc demand could reach ~1.0 Mt by 2030.  
• **Canada:** Consumption is roughly balanced by refined output (~0.6 Mt) plus imports. With relatively flat population and industrial growth, Canadian Zn demand may stay near 0.6–0.7 Mt/year in 2030.  
• **Australia:** Domestic zinc use is small (<0.1 Mt) since most concentrate is exported. Internal demand (steel, agriculture, etc.) is unlikely to exceed ~0.1–0.15 Mt by 2030.  
• **EU:** Current EU zinc demand is on the order of 1.0–1.2 Mt (including Sweden, Poland, etc.). Continued growth in automotive and energy infrastructure (especially galvanizing needs) suggests EU demand could rise to ~1.3–1.4 Mt by 2030. (Ireland’s Tara and other mine closures will shift some need to imports.)  
• **Japan:** Japan uses roughly 0.4–0.6 Mt (mostly for galvanized steel); demand may rise modestly with industrial recovery, on the order of 0.5–0.7 Mt by 2030.  
• **Total US+Allies:** Summing major regions yields roughly 3.5–4.0 Mt today, growing by a few hundred kilotonnes by 2030. The International Zinc Association projects global zinc demand will increase by ~0.7 Mt/yr by 2030 (largely from automotive and infrastructure) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=government%20recognizes%20as%20critical,17)); if the United States and allies account for ~30–35% of that, their aggregate demand could be ~0.2–0.3 Mt higher than today. In round numbers, US & allied zinc demand around 2030 might approach **4.2–4.5 Mt/yr** (up from ~4.0 Mt now).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** U.S. mined zinc production will decline by 2030 as the Red Dog mine winds down. Red Dog (555,600 t in 2024) is expected to close ~2031 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Dog%20operates%20profitably%2C%20with%20total,12%7D%C2%A0Nearby%20deposits%20are%20being%20explored)). The primary new U.S. source is South32’s Hermosa (AZ) (153 Mt deposit, 3.53% Zn) coming online ~H2 2027 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=deposits%E2%80%94both%20vital%20to%20securing%20U,the%20potential%20to%20produce%20battery)). Hermosa’s Taylor deposit (∼28-yr life) may yield on the order of 0.15–0.20 Mt/yr. With Red Dog phased out (~0.56 Mt gone) and Hermosa (~0.15 Mt) added, U.S. mine output could fall to **~0.5 Mt/yr** by 2030 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Dog%20operates%20profitably%2C%20with%20total,12%7D%C2%A0Nearby%20deposits%20are%20being%20explored)) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=deposits%E2%80%94both%20vital%20to%20securing%20U,the%20potential%20to%20produce%20battery)). (Other small U.S. mines may contribute a few tens of kt.)  
• **Canada:** No large new projects are known; output around **0.18–0.20 Mt/yr** is likely into the 2030s, similar to 2022 levels ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20mined%20zinc%20production,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20year)). (Some by-product from new copper projects may add Zn, but overall Canadian production is flat-to-declining.)  
• **Australia:** Mostly brownfield expansion. With existing mine lives extended, Australian production should remain near **1.0–1.1 Mt/yr** by 2030 (as in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=2%20%20,6.3))). No single mega-mine is pending, so output stability depends on sustaining projects like Dugald River, Cannington, and Mt. Isa.  
• **EU (incl. Norway/Iceland):** Will be small (<0.3 Mt). Sweden’s Boliden mines may decline without major new finds. With Tara offline, EU (excl. Sweden) is very light; count Sweden ~0.22 Mt ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=4%20%20,4.1)), Poland’s KGHM byproduct (e.g. ~0.3 Mt seaborne concentrate, pre-discount), other EU negligible. Total allied-European supply ~0.5 Mt.  
• **Japan/Norway/Iceland:** Essentially zero mining. (Japan’s one remaining zinc mine closed decades ago; Norway and Iceland have no Zinc mines.)  
• **Allies Total:** Summing, US + Canada + Australia + EU ≈ **2.0–2.1 Mt/yr** of primary Zn by 2030, roughly on par with today or slightly lower. This falls well short of projected demand (∼4+ Mt).  

## References for volumes  
• Production and consumption statistics are from government and industry sources. For example, Natural Resources Canada’s “Zinc Facts” reports Canadian mine/refined output (2022) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20mined%20zinc%20production,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20year)) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=Estimated%20refined%20zinc%20metal%20production,from%20Alaska%20to%20British%20Columbia)) and provides world production figures (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=2%20%20,4.1)). US production comes from the USGS MCS and industry (US ~750 kt in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/zinc-facts#:~:text=2%20%20,5.8))). Global/sector analysis such as International Zinc Association projections is used for demand growth ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=government%20recognizes%20as%20critical,17)). Industry reports (e.g. GlobalData/Mining‐Technology ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/data-insights/zinc-in-the-us/#:~:text=Leading%20producers%20of%20zinc%20in,Mining%27s%20output%20increased%20by%2012))) identify major producers (Teck, Hecla) and output trends.  
• These figures were cross-referenced with trade data: for instance, [62] shows the US imported ~600 kt refined Zn in 2024 (implying ~770 kt domestic use) and exported ~580 kt of ore ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=United%20States%20remains%20heavily%20dependent,on%20Canada%20and%20Mexico%20as)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological & Geochemical Mapping:** Traditional field mapping of host rocks (e.g. carbonate sequences for MVT deposits, volcanics for VMS deposits) and geochemical sampling (stream/soil/rock assays for Zn–Pb–Ag anomalies) remain core. Pathfinder elements (Pb, Ag, Ba, etc.) in stream sediments can flag buried deposits (e.g. sediment-hosted SEDEX fields). Geostatistical soil grid sampling can reveal subtle Zn anomalies.  
• **Induced-Polarization (IP) Surveys:** IP geophysics measures chargeability from disseminated sulfides. It is highly effective for sediment-hosted and carbonate-hosted Zn–Pb deposits (e.g. MVT and SEDEX types) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229910208_Geophysical_properties_of_zinc-bearing_deposits#:~:text=different%20types%20of%20zinc,before%20a%20prospect%20can%20be)). Low-frequency IP or DC resistivity probes deeper sulfide bodies, especially where magnetic response is weak.  
• **Electromagnetic (EM) Surveys:** Airborne or ground EM is key for detecting conductive sulfide veins or massive sulphides. Volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) and metamorphosed SEDEX ore bodies (often with graphite) are good EM targets ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229910208_Geophysical_properties_of_zinc-bearing_deposits#:~:text=different%20types%20of%20zinc,before%20a%20prospect%20can%20be)).  Time-domain and towed-loop EM systems can image conductors beneath cover.  
• **Gravity and Magnetic Methods:** High-density sulfides and skarn-associated magnetite zones produce gravity/magnetic highs. Gravity surveys over high-grade deposits (e.g. Australia’s Beltana, where massive Pb–Zn is much denser than host dolomite) can pinpoint targets. Magnetics are useful for “Cobar‐style” magnetite-rich orebodies ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229910208_Geophysical_properties_of_zinc-bearing_deposits#:~:text=different%20types%20of%20zinc,before%20a%20prospect%20can%20be)).  
• **Diamond Drilling with Logging:** Successive drill spacing testing anomaly trends – core drilling confirms grade/thickness. Modern drill rigs (e.g. PQ/HQ diamond rigs) and downhole sensing (optical televiewer, gamma logs) allow accurate delineation of ore geometry.  
• **Remote Sensing:** Airborne hyperspectral or multispectral imaging can detect iron-oxide/gossan alterations above sulfide bodies. LiDAR and satellite DEMs help map lineaments and structures controlling mineralization.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Mining:** For large, banner high-grade orebodies near surface. Example: Red Dog (Alaska) is a conventional open-pit zinc–lead mine (Teck Resources) that uses drill/blast and haul trucks ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Dog%20operates%20profitably%2C%20with%20total,12%7D%C2%A0Nearby%20deposits%20are%20being%20explored)). Aitik (Sweden) and Cannington (Australia) also use large open pits for base-metal orebodies.  
• **Underground Mining:** For deep or high-grade veins. Methods include cut‐and‐fill stoping, benching, and sublevel caving. For instance, the Balmat and Lucky Friday (ID) zinc mines use systematic stope mining; Tara (Ireland) is a deep underground mine reaching ~1,000 m depth ([www.boliden.com](https://www.boliden.com/operations/mines/boliden-tara#:~:text=,Type%20of%20mine%3A%20underground)). Modern operations deploy mechanized drill jumbos, raises, and cemented backfill.  
• **Long-Hole Stoping/Sublevel Stoping:** Used in stable massive sulfide zones. Sublevel long-hole stoping (with dewatering and controlled blasts) is applied at many underground Zn–Pb mines.  
• **Ground Control and Ventilation:** Frozen ground techniques (circulating antifreeze brines) or grout curtains may be used at wet sites. Robust ventilation systems and water pumps (e.g. at Red Dog’s MacArthur River zone) control slurry or groundwater. Safety pumps prevent flooding in deep mines (e.g. Greens Creek).  
• **Ore Handling/Crushing:** Run‐of‐mine ore is crushed (jaw, cone crushers) and milled (rod/SAG + ball mills) to liberation (~100–250 microns) prior to concentration. Automated conveyor systems and stackers feed primary crushers in large mines.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Froth Flotation:** The principal separation for sulfide Zn ore. Crushed ore is conditioned with collectors (xanthates) and frothers; sphalerite and galena are floated selectively from gangue ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/research-intelligence/zinc-ore-processing-and-flotation-techniques#:~:text=Zinc%20ore%20processing%2C%20particularly%20through,play%20during%20the%20flotation%20process)). Cleaner flotation stages yield high-grade Zn and Pb concentrates. Ore-specific chemistry (pH, oxidative potential) is controlled to separate copper, then Zn/Pb. For example, smithsonite (ZnCO₃) oxide ores require pretreatment (e.g. sulfidization); Pb²⁺ or Cu²⁺ activators significantly improve smithsonite floatability ([www.nature.com](https://www.nature.com/research-intelligence/zinc-ore-processing-and-flotation-techniques#:~:text=One%20significant%20area%20of%20research,1)).  
• **Gravity Separation:** In some oxide ores (hemimorphite, willemite) or coarse sulfide fractions, high-speed centrifuge and shaking tables sort dense Zn-bearing minerals by gravity difference. Gravity takes off coarse sulfide nodules or oxide minerals before flotation.  
• **Roasting & Leaching (RLE) Pre-Treatment:** In full-processing plants, concentrates can be roasted to convert ZnS to ZnO. A fluidized-bed roaster (≈950°C) oxidizes sulfide to zinc oxide, generating SO₂ gas ([www.sunmetals.com.au](https://www.sunmetals.com.au/sustainability/the-refining-process/#:~:text=Roasting%20Zinc%20concentrates%20are%20received,2%20Leaching)). The calcine (ZnO “roaster oxide”) is then leached in sulfuric acid to produce a zinc sulfate solution.  
• **Pressure Acid Leaching:** High-pressure autoclave leach of Zn concentrates/roast uses oxygen to oxidize and dissolve zinc (often for ores with recalcitrant metallurgy). This is less common than atmospheric roasting.  
• **Solid–Liquid Separation:** Thickening and filtration remove solids from leach solutions (ferrites and gangue residues). High-pressure filter presses produce filter cakes ripe for neutralization (stub).
  
## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Fluidized-Bed Roasting:** (e.g. at Sun Metals, Australia) Consolidated Zn concentrates (~450,000 t/yr) are fed to a fluidized roaster with O₂ at ~950 °C ([www.sunmetals.com.au](https://www.sunmetals.com.au/sustainability/the-refining-process/#:~:text=Roasting%20Zinc%20concentrates%20are%20received,2%20Leaching)). This converts sphalerite (ZnS) to zinc oxide (ZnO) and SO₂. The SO₂ is directed to a sulfuric acid plant (yielding H₂SO₄ by-product).  
• **Acid Leaching:** The roasted calcine (ZnO) is leached with dilute sulfuric acid (typically ~5–10% H₂SO₄) to dissolve zinc as ZnSO₄ ([www.sunmetals.com.au](https://www.sunmetals.com.au/sustainability/the-refining-process/#:~:text=site%20by%20either%20road%20or,As%20a%20result)). Iron and copper impurities precipitate as ferrites and are removed.  
• **Purification (Cementation):** Impurities are removed by adding metallic zinc dust (from recycle). Zinc dust causes cementation of Cu, Cd, etc., which settle out ([www.sunmetals.com.au](https://www.sunmetals.com.au/sustainability/the-refining-process/#:~:text=solution%20containing%20the%20zinc%20sulphate,cooled%20in%20cooling%20towers%20to)). The purified ZnSO₄ solution is cooled to precipitate gypsum and then sent to EW.  
• **Electrowinning (SX/EW):** Zinc is electro-deposited from the purified ZnSO₄ solution onto cathodes (often aluminium) ([www.sunmetals.com.au](https://www.sunmetals.com.au/sustainability/the-refining-process/#:~:text=Electrolysis%20Plant,antimony%20can%20be%20added%20to)). In Sun Metals’ process, zinc deposits are stripped from cathodes and cast. The spent electrolyte (rich in H₂SO₄) is recycled back to leaching ([www.sunmetals.com.au](https://www.sunmetals.com.au/sustainability/the-refining-process/#:~:text=Electrolysis%20Plant,antimony%20can%20be%20added%20to)). Electrowinning produces >99.995% Zn metal.  
• **Kunz-Sellner & Furnace Methods:** Older methods (blast furnace + Bessemer refining) have mostly been replaced. Primary smelters in Europe (Belgium, Sweden) historically used Imperial Smelting Furnaces to co-smelt Zn/Pb. Today most Western refining is hydrometallurgical (roast-leach-EW) as above.  
• **Alloys & Cast Products:** Molten zinc can be alloyed (with Al, Cu) and cast into ingots, billets or strip (e.g. galvanizing grade). Modern induction furnaces melt electrowon zinc for final casting.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Chemical Neutralization (Lime/Limestone):** Addition of Ca(OH)₂ or CaCO₃ raises pH in acid mine drainage (AMD) and precipitates Zn as Zn(OH)₂ ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8118#:~:text=chemical%20treatment%20method%20known%20as,oxidise%20reduced%20metals%20such%20as)). This is the primary “active” treatment; large reaction tanks are used to dose alkaline reagents ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8118#:~:text=chemical%20treatment%20method%20known%20as,oxidise%20reduced%20metals%20such%20as)).  
• **High Density Sludge (HDS):** An enhanced lime treatment where thickened sludge (with recycling of solids and flocculation) reduces wastewater volume ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8118#:~:text=High%20Density%20Sludge%20,density%20sludge%20of)). HDS re-slurries and thickens precipitation products (metal hydroxides), improving handling and metal recovery ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8118#:~:text=High%20Density%20Sludge%20,density%20sludge%20of)).  
• **Biological Sulfate Reduction (Passive):** Constructed wetlands or bioreactors use sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to convert SO₄²⁻ to H₂S, which precipitates Zn as ZnS. Reed/bacteria wetland cells downstream of tailings ponds biologically lower sulfate and metals. This passive method is used at some legacy sites to polish effluent.  
• **Permeable Reactive Barriers:** Trench barriers filled with limestone, compost, or zero-valent iron can intercept Zn-laden groundwater and precipitate metals. For example, limestone-filled cells induce neutralization and metal removal by carbonate formation.  
• **Adsorption & Ion Exchange:** Engineered media (e.g. zeolite, activated carbon, iron oxyhydroxides) selectively adsorb dissolved Zn from AMD. These “polishing” units can clean solutions to regulatory levels (often deployed after lime treatment).  
• **Phytoremediation:** Certain plants (e.g. poplars, wetland grasses) uptake Zn and can be used in afforested treatment wetlands. This is generally slow but can stabilize tailings surfaces and sequester lower Zn levels.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Domestic Refining (Smelting/Electrowinning) Capacity:** The U.S. and many allies lack modern primary zinc smelters. In 2024, the U.S. imported ~73% of its refined zinc ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=United%20States%20remains%20heavily%20dependent,on%20Canada%20and%20Mexico%20as)) because domestic RLE/EW plants are nearly absent. This forces most U.S. mine output to be exported as concentrate, then re-imported as metal, a severe supply-chain bottleneck.  
• **Exploration & Discovery:** Investment in zinc exploration is very low in the U.S. (only ~5.9% of global spend over 25 years ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=The%20limited%20level%20of%20domestic,lowest%20amount%20since%202017.%5E%7B18))), and allied exploration is similarly limited. Inadequate exploration technology/funding leads to few new deposits.  
• **Ore-Grade Decline and Energy Costs:** Remaining Western deposits have much lower Zn grades (e.g. Red Dog went from 20.5% Zn to ~13.4% ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Declining%20domestic%20zinc%20ore%20grades,comparison%2C%20the%20average%20zinc%20grade))) than in the past, requiring more energy and crushing for the same metal yield. This “resource quality” issue constrains production efficiency.  
• **Logistical/Economic:** High energy prices, stringent environmental rules, and geopolitics (e.g. tariffs on Canadian zinc ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=580%2C000%20tons%20of%20that%20ore,noted%20that%20the%20company%20is))) also limit new mine development and processing capacity. While not a “technology” per se, these factors compound technical bottlenecks.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The **critical constraint** is downstream processing: allied nations (especially the U.S.) have little to no modern zinc refining (RLE/EW) capacity, so they export ore and depend on foreign smelters ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=United%20States%20remains%20heavily%20dependent,on%20Canada%20and%20Mexico%20as)). This “refining gap” means that even if mines produce zinc concentrate, it cannot be turned into usable metal domestically. Compounding this, very low exploration spending means few new mines are found ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=The%20limited%20level%20of%20domestic,lowest%20amount%20since%202017.%5E%7B18)), and existing mines see declining grades ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/rebuilding-us-zinc-capacity-era-global-competition#:~:text=Declining%20domestic%20zinc%20ore%20grades,comparison%2C%20the%20average%20zinc%20grade)). Without building domestic smelters and boosting exploration technology/investment, US/allied zinc supply will struggle to meet the projected demand up to 2030.
