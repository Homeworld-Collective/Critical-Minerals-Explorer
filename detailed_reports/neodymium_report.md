## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States (Mountain Pass, CA)** – The only large-scale US rare‐earth mine is MP Materials’ Mountain Pass. In 2024 it produced a record ≈45,000 t of rare‐earth oxide (REO) concentrate, containing roughly 1,300 t of neodymium‐praseodymium (NdPr) oxide ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)). This concentrate is the sole primary Nd source in the US. (Smaller US projects like Round Top, TX are still under development.)  
• **Australia (Western Australia)** – Lynas Rare Earths exploits the Mt. Weld carbonatite. In FY2024 (Jul ’24–Mar ’25) Lynas produced ~4,478 t of NdPr oxide ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2682432-australia-s-lynas-cuts-jan-mar-rare-earth-oxide-output#:~:text=Lynas%20left%20its%20total%20oxide,two%20quarters%20of%20declining%20output)). Q2 2025 output hit 2,080 t NdPr oxide ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2713548-australia-s-lynas-posts-record-2q-rare-earth-output#:~:text=Australian%20mineral%20producer%20Lynas%20Rare,for%20the%20first%20time%20ever)), and Lynas targets ~10,500 t/yr by 2026 (Lynas’ FY2025 goal) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2682432-australia-s-lynas-cuts-jan-mar-rare-earth-oxide-output#:~:text=Lynas%20left%20its%20total%20oxide,two%20quarters%20of%20declining%20output)). Australia is the largest Nd producer outside China.  
• **Canada** – Canada has major known Nd-rich deposits (e.g. Bokan Mountain, Great Western’s Wicheeda, minerally complex ring-of-fire projects), but **no commercial Nd output yet**. Canada’s critical-minerals strategy notes “some of the world’s largest known reserves” of Nd/Pr ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=The%20Canadian%20advantage)), but no production-scale mining or refining is operating as of 2025. A few test plants, exploration programs, and under-construction processing pilot plants (e.g. Saskatchewan solvent-extraction units) exist.  
• **Europe/Norway/Iceland (EU)** – Currently **no active Nd mining or refining** in Europe. Potential deposits (e.g. Norra Kärr, Sweden; Fen Complex, Finland; Sparnberg, Germany; Nussir, Norway) remain in exploration or very early development. No EU country produces commercial Nd (EU 2022 critical-minerals report: 0 t Nd) ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Successful%20commercial%20entry%20into%20the,be%20found%20with%20REE%20deposits)). Norway and Iceland likewise have geological research only, with no Nd mines. Europe relies nearly 100% on imports for Nd and Pr.  
• **Japan** – Japan has **no domestic Nd production**. Historically, Japan imported all Nd feed (often as alloy or oxide) for its electronics, EV, and wind industries. Japan funds overseas RE projects (Vietnam, Mongolia) and magnet recycling, but has no in-country mines or processing as of 2025.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Electric Vehicles (EVs)** – Nd is primarily driven by NdFeB magnets in EV motors. Each EV contains roughly 1–2 kg of rare‐earth magnets ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Neodymium%20,2%20tonnes%20of%20NdFeB%20magnets)). With U.S. EV sales targeted at ~50% of new cars by 2030, Dutch‐Assumptions estimate several thousand tons of Nd/Pr demand in US EVs alone. EU EV deployment is similar in scale. (For reference, 10 million EVs × 1.5 kg/EV ≈ 15,000 t magnets globally; US/EU share ~30%; Nd metal content ~25% of magnet weight.) Demand from US/EU automakers in 2030 can therefore reach **mid-thousands of tons Nd/Pr oxide**.  
• **Wind Turbines** – Modern onshore turbines (~3–5 MW) use ~0.5–1 t of NdFeB magnets each, offshore units (~10 MW) ~1–2 t ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Neodymium%20,2%20tonnes%20of%20NdFeB%20magnets)). Expansions in US and EU wind fleets (particularly offshore wind) will boost Nd demand by a few 100’s of tons per year by 2030. (For example, one 10 MW U.S. offshore turbine can require ~2 t of magnets, implying ~500 kg Nd/Pr per turbine.)  
• **Other (Electronics, Defense)** – Nd/Pr magnets are also used in defense systems (radar, missiles), industrial motors, and consumer electronics. Exact forecasts are sparse, but McKinsey/IEA analyses show NdFeB use growing ~7–10%/yr with clean‐energy transitions ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Adamas%20Intelligence%2C%20a%20market%20intelligence,1)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/#:~:text=NdPr%20oxide%20is%20also%20predicted,supply%20sources%20from%202023%20onward)). Combining sectors, US+allied Nd demand is projected on the order of **10,000–15,000 t of NdPr oxide by 2030** (significantly above current output), driven by EV and wind ramp-up ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Adamas%20Intelligence%2C%20a%20market%20intelligence,1)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/#:~:text=NdPr%20oxide%20is%20also%20predicted,supply%20sources%20from%202023%20onward)).  
• **Benchmark Forecasts** – Adamas Intelligence (2023) projects global magnet-REE (Nd,Pr,Dy,Tb) demand CAGR ~7.1% vs. supply ~5.1%, creating shortfalls from 2023 onward ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Adamas%20Intelligence%2C%20a%20market%20intelligence,1)). By 2030 Adamas predicts a ≈19,000 t global undersupply of NdPr oxide ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/#:~:text=NdPr%20oxide%20is%20also%20predicted,supply%20sources%20from%202023%20onward)). A US+allied share of this gap (roughly a third to a half of global demand) implies domestic needs of several thousand tonnes beyond present production.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **MP Materials (USA)** – MP aims to steadily ramp concentrate output beyond 2024’s record 45 kt REO (≈1.3 kt NdPr). With new U.S. subsidy (DoD $110/kg floor) and expanded CCSSX lines coming online, MP expects to roughly double Nd/Pr metal output by 2030. Its new Independence, TX plant has begun Nd/Pr metal production, with eventual magnet capacity ~1,000 t/yr ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20is%20addressing%20this,gradual%20production%20ramp%20beginning%20in)). A second co-located plant is planned, targeting a combined ~10,000 t/yr of sintered NdFeB magnets – effectively matching current U.S. magnet demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=strategic%20rare%20earth%20infrastructure%2C%20including,Analysts%20expect%20the%20pricing)). Assuming Nd supply parity, MP could thus deliver on the order of 3,000–5,000 t NdPr oxide per year by 2030 (depending on ore grade and allocation of outputs).  
• **Lynas/Ucore (Allied Projects)** – Lynas plans to reach ~10 kt/yr NdPr oxide from Mt Weld by 2030 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2682432-australia-s-lynas-cuts-jan-mar-rare-earth-oxide-output#:~:text=Lynas%20left%20its%20total%20oxide,two%20quarters%20of%20declining%20output)). Additional Australian projects (e.g. Northern Minerals’ Browns Range, Arafura’s Nolans, Peak/Medallion plate clay projects) could add a few thousand tonnes if commercialized. In North America, Ucore’s Bokan (AK) targets ~ND heavy (primarily T elements, limited Nd) and Ildep (BC) and particle finalists. European projects (Sweden, Finland) may start small (<100 t+). Overall, allied domestic oxide supply by 2030 might reach **~10–15 kt NdPr oxide/yr**, which still falls well short of forecast demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=strategic%20rare%20earth%20infrastructure%2C%20including,Analysts%20expect%20the%20pricing)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/#:~:text=NdPr%20oxide%20is%20also%20predicted,supply%20sources%20from%202023%20onward)). (This assumes successful financing of planned mines and plants; voids in processing capacity may further limit realized supply.)

Magnet-REE demand (Nd+Pr+D+Tb) has been 7.1% CAGR (2023–2030 forecast) ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Adamas%20Intelligence%2C%20a%20market%20intelligence,1)); Adamas forecasts a 19,000 t NdPr deficit by 2030 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/#:~:text=NdPr%20oxide%20is%20also%20predicted,supply%20sources%20from%202023%20onward)). U.S. NdFeB magnet demand ~10,000 t/yr (implying several thousand t Nd metal) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=strategic%20rare%20earth%20infrastructure%2C%20including,Analysts%20expect%20the%20pricing)).  
• **Price projections** – Nd oxide price ~$112/kg (2023) → ~$177/kg by 2030; Pr oxide $109→$169 (2030) ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Prices%20for%20main%20magnet%20oxides%2C,Further%2C%20Adamas)). These rising prices reflect tight supply vs. demand.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne or ground gamma-ray spectrometry detects elevated Th/U often associated with REE minerals ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Radiometric%20Surveys)). Carbonatite and monazite/quartz deposits (e.g. Mt. Weld, Bayan Obo, etc.) can be delineated by Th anomalies, since Th frequently substitues into REE minerals. Radiometrics quickly screens large areas for REE-rich outcrops.  
• **Geochemical Sampling:** Systematic soil/stream-silt/rock sampling coupled with ICP-Mass or XRF identifies REE anomalies ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Geochemical%20sampling%20is%20a%20fundamental,chemical%20composition%20of%20an%20area)). For example, elevated Ce/Nd in soils flagged major carbonatite zones. Geochem grids in drainage catchments reveal dispersion halos, even under cover. Sample media include B-horizon soils, outcrop chips, and sediment. (Notably, Bayan Obo’s discovery was based on surface geochemistry ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=China%2C%20was%20initially%20based%20on,the%20soil%20and%20rock%20samples)).)  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Integrated magnetics, gravity and EM surveys map buried carbonatites or HREE-bearing intrusives ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Magnetic%20and%20Gravity%20Surveys)). High-resolution aeromagnetic surveys highlight magnetite-REE skarns or hydrothermal veins. Gravity surveys detect dense bastnäsite/monazite zones. EM methods (e.g. TDEM) can outline conductive clay-hosted or ion-adsorption accumulations. These subsurface methods guide drilling into concealed REE targets.  
• **Remote Sensing:** Satellite/multispectral and hyperspectral imagery spots alteration minerals (e.g. carbonates, clay minerals, vegetation stress) characteristic of REE deposits ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Satellite%20and%20aerial%20imagery%20analysis%3A)). Hyperspectral sensors (e.g. ASTER, AVIRIS) detect spectral features of REE-bearing minerals or associated pathfinder minerals. Synthetic Aperture Radar can reveal lineaments/faults controlling carbonatite emplacement. High-res DEMs/LiDAR aid mapping of geological structures hosting REEs.  
• **Biogeochemical Prospecting:** Utilizing REE-bioaccumulator plants as indicators ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Examples%20of%20indicator%20plants%3A)). Certain species (e.g. the tropical fern *Dicranopteris* or mockernut hickory *Carya tomentosa*) uptake REEs into biomass. Sampling plant foliage or roots (ICP-MS) can indicate subsurface REE enrichment ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=,other%20heavy%20rare%20earth%20elements)). This method excels in heavily vegetated or soil-covered terrain where direct sampling is difficult.  
• **Mineralogical/Petrological Analysis:** Advanced microscopy (SEM/EDX, XRD) on drill cores and hand samples confirms REE-bearing minerals (bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime, eudialyte, etc.) and their alteration. Mineralogy guides exploration by revealing ore textures and paragenesis. PIMA/spectroradiometers may be used in the field to scan outcrops for spectral fingerprints of REE minerals.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Hard-Rock Mining:** Carbonatite and bastnäsite ores are exploited primarily by open-pit operations. Mountain Pass (CA, USA) and Mt. Weld (WA, Australia) use conventional drill/blast, loaders/haul trucks and primary/secondary crushing. Bulk ore tonnages are hauled to on-site mills. Monazite-bearing HREE ores (e.g. Bayan Obo, China) follow similar bench mining. (No significant underground RE mining exists in allied countries to date.)  
• **Physical Beneficiation:** Crushed ore undergoes gravity and magnetic separation to remove gangue. Many bastnäsite deposits contain magnetite (e.g. Mountain Pass ore), permitting wet magnetic isolation of REE-bearing rock ([majrresources.com](https://majrresources.com/are-geophysical-surveys-used-in-the-exploration-of-rare-earth-minerals/#:~:text=Magnetic%20surveys%2C%20on%20the%20other,in%20the%20Earth%E2%80%99s%20magnetic%20field)). Froth flotation is widely used to concentrate bastnäsite/monazite: e.g. flotation cells with fatty-acid or hydroxamate collectors yield rough concentrates (~60–70% RE oxides) by differential wettability. These steps increase REE grades while discarding quartz, carbonates (calcite), and silica. Dense media separation can also pre-concentrate heavy fractions.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** Concentrates are chemically treated to dissolve REEs. For bastnäsite/monazite, sulfidic roasting or direct acid leach is common. Mountain Pass-style bastnäsite is typically calcined (to remove -CO₃, yielding CeO₂ and CaO) then leached with HCl/H₂SO₄. Monazite (REE phosphate) is often digested in hot H₂SO₄ (∼200 °C) to form soluble sulfates ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Monazite)). In these leaching steps, associated Th/U are also solubilized.  
• **pH Precipitation and Oxalate or Carbonate Precipitation:** The pregnant leachate is neutralized (lime or NH₄OH) to sequentially precipitate contaminants and REEs. Typically, at pH≈1–2, thorium/uranium (as insoluble sulfates/hydroxides) drop out ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=In%20the%20process%2C%20impurities%20such,solution%20will%20be%20slowly%20neutralized)). Raising to pH≈2–3 precipitates rare earth hydroxide/carbonates (often using Na₂CO₃ → RE-carbonate). Alternatively, oxalic acid is added to form rare-earth oxalates, which are filtered and calcined to RE oxides ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=In%20the%20interaction%2C%20an%20ion,solution%20as%20sulfates%20and%2For%20chlorides)). Up to 80–90% of REEs can be recovered from clay or bastnäsite leach liquors by this method ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Clays)).  
• **Ion-Exchange Leaching (Ionic-Clays):** While not yet in North America, ion-adsorption clay extraction is important in SE Asia. Low-grade clay deposits are leached with (NH₄)₂SO₄ or Na₂SO₄ brine at ambient conditions, exchanging NH₄⁺ for REE³⁺ adsorbed on clay. The REE-laden solution is collected and precipitated (as above). This technique yields Liable (Nd+Pr) rich solutions without mining rock. (E.g. Jiangxi50 clay in China.) Should analogous clays be confirmed in allied territories, a similar leach-exchange process would apply ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=Clays)).  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The cornerstone for individual REE separation. Multi-stage counter-current SX columns use organophosphorus (e.g. D2EHPA, P350) or carboxylic acid extractants to partition REEs between aqueous and organic phases ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)). Typical flowsheets separate light (La–Nd) from heavy (Sm–Lu) and then isolate Nd from Pr and La by tweaking pH and extractant strength. This produces high-purity Nd₂O₃ proxies. Allied separation plants under development (e.g. REE refineries in US, Canada, Australia) rely on SX circuits.  
• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:** High-purity lab-scale method using resin columns to separate REEs based on slight ionic radius/complexing differences. Whilst rare for bulk plant use, it provides final polishing (e.g. fractional crystallization via resins) when extreme purity is needed. Vendors (e.g. Oro Industries) use continuous ion exchange for refined codex.  
• **Selective Oxidation/Precipitation:** One- and two-step chemical methods to remove specific REEs: e.g. Ce, Pr, and Tb can be oxidized to +4 and precipitated as CeO₂/PrO₂ ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)). KClO₃ or ozone in alkaline solution oxidizes those ions selectively. Cerium (IV) oxide is insoluble and filtered off from mixed RE hydroxide. Praseodymium (IV) quickly precipitates via similar oxidation ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)). This removes Ce/Pr from the Nd-rich solution, simplifying Nd purification.  
• **Carbonate Supercritical Precipitation:** Treating a REE chloride solution with CO₂ at ~40 °C, 100 atm precipitates certain lanthanide carbonates (La, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, etc.) ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=)). This innovative method fractionally separates REEs that form insoluble carbonates under pressure, leaving e.g. Pr, Tb, Dy in solution. It has been demonstrated at lab-scale to precipitate Nd-rich carbonate separate from heavier REEs.  
• **Distillation (Metal Polishing):** For metals, vacuum distillation can refine Nd metal by volatilizing Zinc/Ca residues. Similarly, fused salt distillation and zone melting methods exist for high-purity Nd or REE alloys. (Less common industrially outside China.)  
• **Hydrometallurgical Recycling:** Re-dissolving NdFeB scrap (by acid leach or mild corrosion) then applying SX or precipitation. For example, simple water corrosion followed by dilute acid yielded >90% Nd recovery from shredded magnets ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=both%20the%20REE%20and%20P,the%20energy%20consumption%20is%20considerable)), illustrating a separation pathway for recycled Nd.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metal Reduction (Calciothermic):** Nd and Pr metal are commercially produced by reducing chlorides/oxides with calcium or aluminum at high temperature. In the *calciothermic* route, NdCl₃ (from Nd₂O₃) is mixed with Ca granules; heating (∼900 °C) yields Nd metal and CaCl₂ slag. This is done in steel retorts or rotary kilns. The Nd metal (as powder) is collected after removing CaCl₂. Allied producers (e.g. MP Materials) are reviving such furnaces.  
• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Alternative lab method: molten fluoride electrolytes (e.g. LiF–CaF₂–NdF₃) at ~800 °C can directly reduce Nd³⁺ to metal at a cathode. While demonstrated in labs ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384431001_Study_on_the_extraction_of_neodymium_metal_by_calciothermic_reduction_process#:~:text=Study%20on%20the%20extraction%20of,emissions%20of%20greenhouse%20gases%20such)), it’s energy-intensive and produces greenhouse gases. No large-scale electrolytic Nd plants operate outside R&D.  
• **Vacuum Refining:** Nd metal typically contains impurities (Mg from reduction slag). Vacuums induction furnaces heat Nd/Pr alloy under low pressure to evaporate volatile impurities (Zn, Mg) and segregate high-purity metal. Multi-pass remelting and inert-gas atomization also refine Nd for magnet powder.  
• **Alloyification and Magnet Fabrication:** Processed Nd/Pr metal is alloyed with Fe, B (and Dy/Tb for high-coercivity grades) in induction melters to form sinterable Nd₂Fe₁₄B alloy. The alloy is then milled into powder, aligned in a magnetic field, pressed and sintered into bonded or sintered NdFeB magnets. These steps (melt-spinning, hot pressing, annealing) constitute final refinement to salable magnet form.  
• **Advanced Purification (Distillation/Plasma):** Research methods (e.g. vacuum distillation columns or cold crucible melting) further increase purity of HREE admixtures used in magnets. Plasma separators can separate REE vapors by mass differences, though still experimental.  
• **Recycling Refinement:** Thermal desorption or chemical stripping of Nd from recycled magnets (once separated from ferrous scrap) yields Nd oxide, which is then reduced/refined as above. For example, selective leaching of NdFeB swarf followed by precipitation allowed >90% Nd recapture ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=both%20the%20REE%20and%20P,the%20energy%20consumption%20is%20considerable)).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Acid Neutralization & Precipitation:** Mine effluents and processing liquor are treated by adding lime or caustic. This raises pH, precipitating REE hydroxides and any U/Th. For example, dilute ammonium hydroxide addition at pH~1–3 will precipitate thorium/uranium as insoluble hydroxides first and then lanthanide hydroxides ([condorchem.com](https://condorchem.com/en/blog/extraction-rare-earths/#:~:text=In%20the%20process%2C%20impurities%20such,solution%20will%20be%20slowly%20neutralized)). The precipitated solid is filtered, immobilizing radioelements and recovering REEs. This basic precipitation is the primary method for treating acid leach solutions and mine drainage.  
• **Constructed Wetlands/Bioremediation:** Engineered wetland systems incorporate plants/microbes to sequester metals. Certain aquatic plants/algae can uptake REEs from tailings water. Wetland ponds neutralize pH and promote REE co-precipitation with calcium carbonate or iron oxyhydroxides. Although not yet routine at RE mines, such green treatments (e.g. using bauxite residue or biochar media with high sorption capacity) are under study for REE-laden waters.  
• **Tailings Retreatment:** Instead of disposal, tailings can be reprocessed to reduce environmental risk. Hydrometallurgical recovery (acid leach + cryogenic crystallization) from apatite‐bearing tailings has achieved 70–100% REE recovery ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=leaching%2C%20followed%20by%20cryogenic%20crystallization,the%20ferrous%20scrap%20of%20shredded)). For example, an alkaline-leach/crystallization flowsheet cooled pregnant liquor to crystallize out Ca, then used SX to extract heavy REEs ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=leaching%2C%20followed%20by%20cryogenic%20crystallization,the%20ferrous%20scrap%20of%20shredded)). This both remediates tailings by removing REE/Ca and produces saleable REE oxides.  
• **Adsorption and Ion-Exchange:** Spent-process water can be passed through adsorbent beds (e.g. engineered silica, modified zeolites or ion-exchange resins) that capture residual REE ions. After breakthrough, REEs are eluted and recovered. This polishes effluent to very low REE ppt levels. Pilot systems (e.g. using Boehmite sorbents) have cleaned REE-rich acid drainage to near-neutral pH and <0.1 ppm residual REE.  
• **Radioactive Waste Management:** The Th/U co-products from rare-earth mining require special disposal. Remediation technologies include solidification: mixing Th/U-bearing solids into cementitious matrices to immobilize radionuclides before placement in lined cells. Ongoing R&D (e.g. microbial uranium reduction or phosphate barriers) aims to stabilize any leached radioisotopes. Proper waste rock cover design and long-term monitoring are also key to REE site closure.  
• **Recycling/Reclamation:** Recovering REEs from electronic or industrial scrap (a form of remediation) reduces environmental stress on mining. Hydrometallurgical processes (corrosion + acid leach, or high-temp smelting) recover >90% Nd from shredded NdFeB magnets or ores ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=both%20the%20REE%20and%20P,the%20energy%20consumption%20is%20considerable)). Processing magnet waste not only supplies material but also mitigates disposal impacts.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The *primary bottleneck* is midstream processing (separation and refining). While allied countries have or are building mine output (MP, Lynas, etc.), **commercial-scale hydrometallurgical separation of Nd/Pr remains scarce** outside China. Established SX plants in US/Canada/Australia are only just coming online. A US review explicitly notes that “technical specialization required for processing and separation” is a major challenge ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Successful%20commercial%20entry%20into%20the,be%20found%20with%20REE%20deposits)). In practice, the few existing facilities must scale dramatically; e.g. DoD-backed efforts aim for ~10,000 t/yr of domestic NdFeB magnet production (requiring equivalent oxide production) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=strategic%20rare%20earth%20infrastructure%2C%20including,Analysts%20expect%20the%20pricing)). Without additional solvent-extraction lines and metal-refining capacity, allied ore output cannot be fully converted into Nd metal or magnets, making midstream chemistry the chokepoint.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In summary, allied production is constrained not by ore, but by processing capacity. The US and partners still lack sufficient rare-earth separation/refinement plants to convert domestic concentrate into Nd metal or magnets. Current strategies (e.g. MP Materials’ Texas magnet plant and government price supports) are needed just to approach existing demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=strategic%20rare%20earth%20infrastructure%2C%20including,Analysts%20expect%20the%20pricing)) ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/campaign/critical-minerals-in-canada/critical-minerals-an-opportunity-for-canada/permanent-magnets.html#:~:text=Successful%20commercial%20entry%20into%20the,be%20found%20with%20REE%20deposits)). Thus **hydrometallurgical separation (solvent-extraction) and rare-earth metallurgy** are the critical bottleneck – without them, even new mines will under-serve US/allied Nd requirements.
