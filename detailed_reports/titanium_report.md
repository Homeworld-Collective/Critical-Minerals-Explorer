## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production

Domestic Ti-sponge production for aerospace-grade metal is virtually nonexistent in the US today ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  By 2023 only a tiny electronics-grade plant remained active ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)), after the last large commercial Kroll plant shut down in 2020. Consequently, US and allied industries rely almost entirely on imports of sponge or molten billet from overseas producers such as Japan and Kazakhstan.  The only commercially proven process for titanium metal remains the conventional Kroll route (chlorinate ilmenite/rutile to TiCl₄, then reduce with Mg) ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=Titanium%20has%20been%20mass%20produced,Scope%201%20and%202%20emissions)). This multi-step process is very energy- and capital-intensive (requiring high-temperature kilns, multi-stage vacuum distillation of MgCl₂, and vacuum melting to alloy) ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=Titanium%20has%20been%20mass%20produced,Scope%201%20and%202%20emissions)), and it produces large waste streams (magnesium chloride slag and CO₂).  To date, no alternative reduction technology (FFC-Cambridge molten-salt electrolysis, direct hydrogenation of TiCl₄, etc.) has reached industrial scale ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/2/408#:~:text=Kroll%20process%20and%20thereby%20reduce,commercial%20application%20must%20solve%20the)).  In short, rebuilding or replacing Kroll-based titanium–magnesium reduction capacity (or massively scaling advanced recycling) is the key technological challenge to restoring domestic Ti-metal supply ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=Titanium%20has%20been%20mass%20produced,Scope%201%20and%202%20emissions)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/2/408#:~:text=Kroll%20process%20and%20thereby%20reduce,commercial%20application%20must%20solve%20the)).

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)

Current domestic production of titanium-bearing raw materials is very limited.  In the US, there is only one small heavy-sand mining operation (concentrate for pigment) and essentially no primary titanium metal output ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  A USGS assessment emphasizes that heavy-mineral sand resources (the coastal plain deposits of ilmenite/rutile) are vastly underdeveloped and that the US “is heavily reliant on imports” of these minerals ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/gggsc/science/heavy-mineral-sand-resources-southeastern-us#:~:text=mineral%20resources,5070L%2C%20%E2%80%98Deposit%20model)).  By contrast, allied countries have far larger ore resources.  For example Titania’s Tellnes mine in Norway (Kronos/Titania) is a major ilmenite operation with on the order of 0.87 million tonnes/year of 44–45% TiO₂ concentrate capacity ([www.kronosww.com](https://www.kronosww.com/locations/hauge-i-dalane-norway-2/#:~:text=Titania%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20expand%20its%20product%20markets)).  Australia’s mineral sands industry (Iluka, Tronox, etc.) produces roughly 0.63 Mt of ilmenite and 0.20 Mt of rutile (TiO₂) annually ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/aimr/preliminary-tables#:~:text=Ilmenite%20%20,126)) (plus 0.41 Mt of zircon). Japan currently produces about 55,000 tonnes/year of titanium sponge metal ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2659047-aerospace-approved-ti-sponge-supply-up-in-2024#:~:text=Japanese%20titanium%20sponge%20production%20amounted,domestic%20consumers%2C%20weighed%20on%20volumes)) (high-purity ingot for aerospace) from its two remaining Kroll plants.  Meanwhile, Canada and most EU countries have only very small outputs of titanium minerals (usually none in the UK or Iceland).  In aggregate, US/domestic output is on the order of 0.3–0.5 Mt of ilmenite/rutile concentrate per year, while allied production (e.g. Norway ~0.87 Mt, Australia >1 Mt, Japan 55 kt sponge) dwarfs this.  However, only Japan’s 55 kt/yr sponge (plus converts of scrap) actually provides titanium metal – the rest is used for pigments – so metal production capacity remains tightly constrained ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2659047-aerospace-approved-ti-sponge-supply-up-in-2024#:~:text=Japanese%20titanium%20sponge%20production%20amounted,domestic%20consumers%2C%20weighed%20on%20volumes)) ([www.kronosww.com](https://www.kronosww.com/locations/hauge-i-dalane-norway-2/#:~:text=Titania%20is%20one%20of%20the,to%20expand%20its%20product%20markets)).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)

Projected titanium metal demand by 2030 from the US and allied aerospace, defense and industrial sectors is on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes per year.  Boeing’s latest commercial aircraft outlook forecasts about 43,600 new airliners over the 20-year period through 2044 ([aviationweek.com](https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/location/boeing-sees-demand-43600-new-airliners-over-next-20-years#:~:text=latest%2020,over%20the%20next%20two%20decades)) (roughly 2,180 per year on average).  Assuming each new passenger jet contains roughly 10–15 t of Ti (single-aisle) up to ~30–40 t (long-range widebody) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/metals-platform/newsandanalysis/article/2495230-Aerospace-ramp-up-continues-to-drive-titanium-demand#:~:text=Bu%20the%20amount%20of%20titanium,in%20an%20A350%20or%20787)), that implies a commercial aerospace requirement on the order of 20–50 kt/yr of titanium metal over the next two decades.  In fact, Argus estimates global commercial airframe titanium demand was about 220 kt total (≈44 kt/yr) in 2021–2025, and Airbus/Boeing planning figures (e.g. Airbus ~12 widebodies per month by 2028, Boeing ~10 widebodies per month by 2026) indicate continued growth ([aviationweek.com](https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/location/boeing-sees-demand-43600-new-airliners-over-next-20-years#:~:text=latest%2020,over%20the%20next%20two%20decades)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/metals-platform/newsandanalysis/article/2495230-Aerospace-ramp-up-continues-to-drive-titanium-demand#:~:text=Bu%20the%20amount%20of%20titanium,in%20an%20A350%20or%20787)).  Adding military (fighter jets, helicopters, missile systems) and other industrial uses (chemical plants, power turbines, medical and consumer products) likely brings US/allied demand into the 40–60 kt/yr range by 2030.  In effect, the US/allied share of global Ti metal demand typically constitutes a majority (on the order of 60–70%), driven mainly by robust aerospace manufacturing ([aviationweek.com](https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/location/boeing-sees-demand-43600-new-airliners-over-next-20-years#:~:text=latest%2020,over%20the%20next%20two%20decades)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/metals-platform/newsandanalysis/article/2495230-Aerospace-ramp-up-continues-to-drive-titanium-demand#:~:text=Bu%20the%20amount%20of%20titanium,in%20an%20A350%20or%20787)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)

Supply-side projections to 2030 indicate a substantial supply shortfall under current plans.  No major new U.S. titanium mine or Kroll sponge plant is scheduled for completion by 2030.  Thus almost all foreseeable supply will come from recycled scrap and imports of sponge/ingot.  The USGS notes that, apart from the one small electronics-use producer, domestic sponge output is effectively zero ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  Recycling of high-grade aerospace scrap is being incentivized, but realistically is likely to yield at most on the order of a few thousand tonnes per year (for example, a new U.S. recycling plant can process ~10 kt/yr of scrap ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/column-europe-struggles-to-break-russias-titanium-grip/#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20US%20processing%20capacity%20is,10%2C000%20metric%20tons%20per%20year))).  The Pentagon and DOE are supporting such ventures (e.g. IperionX’s new Virginia plant won ~$12.7M DOD funding to reach ~125 t/yr demonstration scale in 2024 ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=IperionX%20will%20apply%20the%20US%2412,the%20same%20site%20in%20Virginia))), but that only begins to nibble at large-scale demand.  Imports will continue to fill the gap: Japan will likely continue ~55 kt/yr of high-grade sponge output ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2659047-aerospace-approved-ti-sponge-supply-up-in-2024#:~:text=Japanese%20titanium%20sponge%20production%20amounted,domestic%20consumers%2C%20weighed%20on%20volumes)), and Europe will import both Japanese sponge and scrap.  Notably, about 70% of Europe’s titanium scrap is currently exported (mostly to the US) for re-melting ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/column-europe-struggles-to-break-russias-titanium-grip/#:~:text=The%20irony%20for%20European%20policymakers,source%20of%20US%20titanium%20production)), indicating limited local supply growth.  Meanwhile, heavy-mineral concentrate from allied mines (Norway, Australia, etc.) primarily goes to TiO₂ pigment production, with only a fraction convertible to metal.  Putting these together, US/allied metal supply by 2030 is expected to reach on the order of 20–30 kt/yr (mostly recycled or imported semi-processed titanium) – well below the 40–60 kt/yr demand estimate, thus implying a persistent deficit without new domestic sponge capacity ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/column-europe-struggles-to-break-russias-titanium-grip/#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20US%20processing%20capacity%20is,10%2C000%20metric%20tons%20per%20year)).

## Key Discovery Technologies

Exploration for titanium mineral deposits typically leverages geophysical and geochemical methods tailored to heavy-mineral sands and igneous Ti ores.  For coastal/placer sands, airborne or ground radiometric (gamma-ray) surveys can detect thorium- and uranium-rich accessory minerals (e.g. monazite, zircon) that commonly accompany ilmenite/rutile ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5070/l/#:~:text=sillimanite%2Fkyanite%2C%20staurolite%2C%20monazite%2C%20and%20garnet,)).  (Monazite contains Th, so anomalous radioactivity often marks buried heavy-mineral concentrations ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5070/l/#:~:text=sillimanite%2Fkyanite%2C%20staurolite%2C%20monazite%2C%20and%20garnet,)).)  Aeromagnetic and gravity surveys are effective for locating dense intrusive sources: many hard-rock ilmenite deposits occur in magnetite-bearing mafic/ultramafic intrusions, which can produce magnetic/gravity anomalies.  For example, the Rogaland anorthosite province (host to several large Norwegian ilmenite bodies) is mapped using these techniques.  Regional geologic mapping and geochemical soil/stream-sediment surveys (analyzing high Ti, Fe, V, Nb, REE) are standard for identifying paleoshorelines, sedimentary placers, or igneous provinces with elevated Ti.  Remote sensing and drone-based surveys are increasingly used: hyperspectral sensors (on UAV or satellite) can distinguish TiO₂ minerals or iron oxides in outcrops, and LiDAR can reveal subtle relict dune topography of ancient placers.  Once targets are defined, diamond-core drilling (and trenching in outcrop) is employed to delineate ore grade, mineralogy, and thickness (e.g. exploration drilling in Norway’s Engebø rutile-ore discovered ~25% TiO₂ grades over large tonnages). In summary, modern exploration for titanium combines airborne geophysics, ground radiometrics/chemistry, high-resolution imagery, and conventional core drilling ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5070/l/#:~:text=sillimanite%2Fkyanite%2C%20staurolite%2C%20monazite%2C%20and%20garnet,)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/column-europe-struggles-to-break-russias-titanium-grip/#:~:text=Indeed%2C%20US%20processing%20capacity%20is,10%2C000%20metric%20tons%20per%20year)).

## Key Extraction Technologies

Titanium feedstocks (ilmenite, rutile, titanomagnetite) are extracted using open-pit or dredge mining, often followed by on-site wet concentration.  Beach and dune placers are commonly mined in large open pits or with floating dredge systems (Australia, South Africa) that pump sand-water slurry to processing plants.  In places like Norway’s Tellnes, conventional truck-and-shovel open-pit mining is used.  The mined heavy-sand is then processed by gravity methods: spiral concentrators and inclined classifier bins separate dense Ti-bearing minerals from gangue sand.  Multi-stage spiral circuits are standard – for example, Iluka’s operations use spirals to achieve high recovery (>90%) of ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024009976#:~:text=This%20article%20discusses%20the%20main,high%20content%20of%20impurity%20components)).  Cyclones or other classifiers are used in parallel to deslime and supply the spirals with optimal feed.  Concentrated heavy-mineral slurry is then dewatered and dried: thickening and vacuum/pneumatic belt filters produce final cakes of 40–50% TiO₂-grade dry ilmenite or rutile concentrates.  The concentrate typically undergoes further grinding or magnetic processing if needed.  For instance, some titaniferous magnetite ores are semi-autogenously ground (SAG mills) to liberate fine rutile, and then floated or magnetically separated under reducing conditions to upgrade TiO₂ ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-020-04304-3#:~:text=Titanium,a%20pilot%20study%20are%20compared)).  Many processes include staged magnetic separation: ilmenite (weakly magnetic) can be partially reduced to magnetite (more magnetic), then run through high-intensity magnetic separators to segregate it from coarser rutile. Likewise, electrostatic or heavy-media (dense medium) separators can be used to sort by density. These mechanical and hydrocyclone steps (the “wet concentrator plant”) are industry-standard for heavy-mineral prey ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024009976#:~:text=This%20article%20discusses%20the%20main,high%20content%20of%20impurity%20components)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-020-04304-3#:~:text=Titanium,a%20pilot%20study%20are%20compared)). The end products are high-TiO₂-grade mineral concentrates (typically 55–60% TiO₂ for rutile, 45% TiO₂ for upgraded ilmenite) which serve either pigment plants (as feed or upgraded slag) or downstream metalmaking.

## Key Separation Technologies

Critical to heavy-sand processing are dense media, gravity, and magnetic separation techniques to isolate and upgrade Ti minerals.  Initially, dense-medium separation (DMS) using magnetite or ferrosilicon slurries sinks heavy minerals (ilmenite, rutile, zircon) and floats light gangue (quartz).  DMS is often the first stage to bulk-concentrate heavy fraction before finer separation.  Spiral concentrators (gravity spirals) are then applied in series to the DMS concentrate: each spiral stage exploits slight density differences, moving Ti minerals toward one side and quartz to the other. Modern mineral-sand spiral plants can process tens to hundreds of tonnes per hour, achieving >90% recovery of ilmenite and rutile ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024009976#:~:text=This%20article%20discusses%20the%20main,high%20content%20of%20impurity%20components)).  (In arid regions, pneumatic separation like air jigs/tables may be used on coarse heavy-mineral sands.)  For final upgrading, high-intensity magnetic separators (HIMS) are widely used: many ilmenite concentrates are partially reduced to magnetite in a hot furnace, then passed through HIMS to split magnetic ilmenite from non-magnetic rutile.  The resulting rutile-rich concentrate is often >90% TiO₂. Conversely, flotation can refine titanomagnetite or rutile: in slurry circuits, collectors (e.g. fatty acids, amines) selectively float rutile over ilmenite or vice versa, especially after fine grinding.  For titaniferous magnetite, flotation removes silicate gangue prior to smelting.  Throughout, hydraulic washing and desliming cyclones play support roles to remove clays and fines (<63 μm) before gravity/magnetic steps, improving recovery and concentrate grade. Overall, heavy liquid (DMS), spiral gravity, magnetic/electrostatic and (where needed) flotation circuits together form the standard heavy-mineral separation train ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024009976#:~:text=This%20article%20discusses%20the%20main,high%20content%20of%20impurity%20components)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-020-04304-3#:~:text=Titanium,a%20pilot%20study%20are%20compared)).

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies

Once high-TiO₂ concentrates or sponge are obtained, further purification is needed to produce Ti metal.  (For titanium-dioxide pigment, dedicated chemistries are used.)  In the TiO₂ pigment industry, two main routes are used: the sulfate and chloride processes.  The sulfate process digests ilmenite in concentrated H₂SO₄ to make TiOSO₄, which is hydrolyzed to precipitate TiO₂. This leaves huge volumes of acidic waste and iron sulfate (“copperas”) and gypsum byproducts.  Advanced treatments (e.g. two-stage neutralization with lime and aeration) can precipitate Fe(OH)₃ and gypsum ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1626#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20titanium%20dioxide,had%20a%20membrane%20flux%20of)).  Many pigment producers now recover those salts: e.g. ferrous sulfate can be crystallized (szomolnokite) and used in cement or soil amendment, and the red gypsum can be sold as a construction and remediation material ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/6/575#:~:text=about%20its%20potential%20valorisation%20are,53)).  The chloride route oxidizes rutile (or titania slag) with Cl₂ and coke to TiCl₄ gas, then burns off TiCl₄ to deposit pure TiO₂.  This requires very pure feed (≥90% TiO₂).  Both methods generate large volumes of solid waste (millions of tonnes per year globally), but responsible operations recycle or sell byproducts (e.g. gypsum in building products ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/6/575#:~:text=about%20its%20potential%20valorisation%20are,53))).

For metal production, the purified TiCl₄ from either process is reduced with molten Mg (the Kroll process) at ~800–1000 °C to yield titanium sponge plus MgCl₂ slag.  The crude sponge still contains residual Mg and MgCl₂, so it is repeatedly vacuum-distilled to remove Mg and chlorine impurities.  The final sponge (often called sponge or titanium “sponge cake”) is <1% impurities.  It is then consolidated into ingots by vacuum arc remelting (VAR) or vacuum induction melting (VIM).  VAR is standard for aerospace/CP-grade Ti, providing chemical homogeneity and low oxygen.  (Some new vacuum arc and electron-beam furnaces can melt up to 30–50 t ingots.)  For other applications, vacuum tilt furnaces and furnaces under inert gas may suffice.  In all cases, melting scrubs the sponge of residual contaminants.  Electrometallurgical methods (electrorefining in molten salts) have been researched but are not yet commercial for Ti.  Currently, no industrial alternative to the Kroll route is commercial: even promising methods like FFC-Cambridge electro-reduction of TiO₂ or chemical hydride processes are still at pilot/pilot scale ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/2/408#:~:text=Kroll%20process%20and%20thereby%20reduce,commercial%20application%20must%20solve%20the)) ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=Titanium%20has%20been%20mass%20produced,Scope%201%20and%202%20emissions)).  Therefore rebuilding Kroll sponge capacity (or realizing an electrolytic process at scale) remains the essential path to domestic TiMetal.

## Key Remediation Technologies

Titanium process industries generate significant wastes (acidic effluents, slag, fine tailings) that must be managed sustainably. For TiO₂ sulfate plants, the primary waste is dilute sulfuric acid with dissolved sulfates, plus solid ferrous sulfates (“copperas”) and calcium sulfates (“red gypsum”).  Modern waste-water treatment uses neutralization (e.g. adding lime or limestone) to precipitate iron as hydroxides and gypsum ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1626#:~:text=The%20production%20of%20titanium%20dioxide,had%20a%20membrane%20flux%20of)).  Recent pilot studies show sequential ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis can remove >95% of dissolved solids from sulfate-process effluent ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1626#:~:text=achieved%20a%20TDS%20removal%20rate,UF%2FRO%20deep%20treatment%20of%20sulfuric)), enabling almost complete water recycling.  Many pigment producers crystallize their ferrous sulfate byproducts: the FeSO₄·7H₂O (szomolnokite) and FeSO₄·H₂O can be sold for cement or soil amendment.  Red gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O enriched in iron) is increasingly valorized: in Spain, for example, it has been used as a cement binder and in environmental remediation (soil stabilizer, metal adsorbent) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/6/575#:~:text=about%20its%20potential%20valorisation%20are,53)).  More broadly, any gypsum-based slag or spent residue is being evaluated as a substitute cementitious material or aggregate, reducing landfill.

Heavy-sand mine tailings (predominantly sand with residual fines) are typically rehabilitated on-site. Common practices include recontouring tailings sand to the original topography and revegetating; slurry stacking with compaction aids; and adding flocculants or constructed wetlands to capture fine clays.  Well-graded sand tailings are often used as backfill or surface cover, because they are inert and drainable.  For example, Australian mines mix tailings sand with fertilized topsoil and native plants to restore mined dunes.  In situ monazite/REE-bearing tailings may also be reprocessed or stockpiled under engineered covers due to their slight radioactivity.

Process dust and fume control is ubiquitous: all chlorination and reduction equipment is vented to high-efficiency bag/filter houses and scrubbers.  Particulate filters (baghouses or electrostatic precipitators) capture TiO₂, Fe₂O₃, and metal oxide dust from forging/melting operations.  Acid fumes (HCl, SO₂) from pigment plants are neutralized in scrubbers.  Collected baghouse dust (often enriched in Ti and Fe) is typically recycled back into pigment or sponge feed.

Spent metallurgical slags (rich in TiO₂) from smelting can also be re-used.  Certain titaniferous slags are cooled and sold as “synthetic rutile” (feedstock for pigment chloride process).  Calcium-aluminate slags from Kroll (MgCl₂ calcine) can be processed to recover chloride or used as construction aggregate.  Old Ti-reactor bricks and MgO crucible stubs (low-level contaminated) are recycled into ferrous melt or safely encapsulated in cement, rather than landfilled.

## Key Bottleneck summary

In summary, the absence of domestic sponge production and the reliance on the Kroll route represent the central supply-chain bottleneck ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20United%20States,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  The traditional Kroll–VAR pathway demands large capital and energy inputs and produces abundant waste ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=Titanium%20has%20been%20mass%20produced,Scope%201%20and%202%20emissions)), and no drop-in substitute is yet available ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/2/408#:~:text=Kroll%20process%20and%20thereby%20reduce,commercial%20application%20must%20solve%20the)).  Without new investments in sponge-making capacity (either rebuilt chlor-alkali reduction plants or breakthrough direct Ti-electrolysis) or large-scale high-grade scrap recycling, US/allied titanium supply will remain constrained and heavily import-dependent. Developing domestic Ti reduction capability (or scaling revolutionary methods) is crucial to closing the looming 2030 supply–demand gap ([iperionx.com](https://iperionx.com/2023/11/01/iperionx-receives-us12-7m-u-s-department-of-defense-grant-for-domestic-titanium-production/#:~:text=Titanium%20has%20been%20mass%20produced,Scope%201%20and%202%20emissions)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/2/408#:~:text=Kroll%20process%20and%20thereby%20reduce,commercial%20application%20must%20solve%20the)).
