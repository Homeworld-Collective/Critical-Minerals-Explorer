## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
The United States has only a single active heavy-mineral sands operation for Ti feedstock today.  That Virginia/Georgia ilmenite‐leucoxene deposit produces on the order of 300–320 thousand tonnes of heavy‐mineral concentrate per year (approximately 318,500 tpa) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/heavy-mineral-sand-resources-southeastern-us#:~:text=applications.%20The%20extensive%20heavy,mineral%20sands%20in%20coastal%20environments%E2%80%99)).  Nearly all other U.S. titanium needs (metal and pigment) are met by imports ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/heavy-mineral-sand-resources-southeastern-us#:~:text=applications.%20The%20extensive%20heavy,mineral%20sands%20in%20coastal%20environments%E2%80%99)).  In contrast, allied countries host larger mineral deposits: for example, Titania (a subsidiary of Kronos) operates Norway’s Tellnes ilmenite mine, producing ~500,000 tpa of 44–45% TiO₂ ilmenite concentrate ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=2,45%20%25%20TiO2)). Japan’s domestic industry (Toho Titanium/Osaka Titanium) produces roughly 55,000 tpa of titanium sponge (atable CP-grade metal) in 2024 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2659047-aerospace-approved-ti-sponge-supply-up-in-2024#:~:text=Japanese%20titanium%20sponge%20production%20amounted,domestic%20consumers%2C%20weighed%20on%20volumes)). Australia (ILUKA, TRONOX) also deploys multiple mines (e.g. Eneabba, Yoganup) generating heavy-mineral concentrates for export, though exact Australian mine output is on the order of a few hundred tonnes of titanium per year (peak ~0.7 kt in 2021 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1130573/australia-production-of-titanium-from-mines/#:~:text=Advertisement))). In practice, Canada, Europe (EU/UK), Iceland, and Norway have essentially no significant mine production of titanium metal – only small mineral sands or recycling operations. (Norway’s output is dominated by the Tellnes ilmenite mine; Norway also has large undeveloped rutile deposits but no producing new mines beyond Titania’s.) Thus, U.S. domestic production is ~318 kt/yr of Ti-ore concentrate, Norway adds ~500 kt concentrate/yr, Japan ~55 kt Ti-sponge metal/yr, and the rest (Canada, EU, Iceland, etc.) is negligible. In total, active allied production of titanium‐bearing material (ore or sponge) is on the order of 900–1,000 kt per year, largely in raw concentrate form rather than refined metal.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Titanium demand for 2030 among the US and its allies is projected in the range of a few×10^4 tonnes per year.  The dominant driver is aerospace: Boeing forecasts ~43,600 new aircraft sold by 2044 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-trims-projection-20-year-jet-demand-2025-06-14/#:~:text=Boeing%20has%20released%20its%2020,Despite%20maintaining%20similar%20jet%20delivery)), and historically each new airliner contains 10–40 t of titanium (single-aisle jets ~10–15 t; larger twins ~30–40 t) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/pt/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2495230-aerospace-ramp-up-continues-to-drive-titanium-demand#:~:text=Bu%20the%20amount%20of%20titanium,aisles%20make%20up%20the%20majority)).  Commercial aerospace demand for titanium in 2021–2025 was estimated at ~220 kt total (about 44 kt/yr) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2261077-structural-shifts-in-aerospace-to-reshape-ti-demand#:~:text=Timet%20also%20predicts%20that%20titanium,bottlenecks%20and%20inventory%20overhang%20at)) – implying that by 2030, with recovering build rates and record order backlogs, yearly aerospace demand could easily approach or exceed 50 kt/yr.  Including defense (military jets, helicopters, missile guidance systems) and industrial uses (chemical, power, medical implants, automotive), US/allied consumption could reach roughly 30–50 kt/yr by 2030.  For reference, Argus reported that aerospace Ti demand over 2021–25 might total ~220 kt ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2261077-structural-shifts-in-aerospace-to-reshape-ti-demand#:~:text=Timet%20also%20predicts%20that%20titanium,bottlenecks%20and%20inventory%20overhang%20at)); allied producers (US, EU, Japan, etc.) would supply the majority of this.  Boeing’s and Airbus’s 20-year forecasts imply a ~40% growth in air travel by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-trims-projection-20-year-jet-demand-2025-06-14/#:~:text=Air%20India%20787%20crash%20in,of%20its%20order%20backlog)), so even with a shift towards less-Ti-intensive narrowbodies, the overall demand remains high.  In summary, taking Boeing’s forecast and an average ~30 t titanium per aircraft ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/pt/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2495230-aerospace-ramp-up-continues-to-drive-titanium-demand#:~:text=Bu%20the%20amount%20of%20titanium,aisles%20make%20up%20the%20majority)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-trims-projection-20-year-jet-demand-2025-06-14/#:~:text=Boeing%20has%20released%20its%2020,Despite%20maintaining%20similar%20jet%20delivery)) suggests global titanium needs of ~1.3 Mt over 20 years (~65 kt/yr), of which US and allied share is on the order of 30–50 kt/yr by 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Projected domestic supply by 2030 will depend almost entirely on recycling and allied production, since no major new US mine or sponge plant is expected.  In the US, domestic sponge production is effectively zero (the last plant closed in 2020 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2145390-us-looks-to-revive-domestic-titanium-supply#:~:text=The%20US%20is%20looking%20to,imports%20of%20the%20critical%20metal))), so supply comes from recycled scrap and imports of semi-finished titanium (sponge/ingot) from allied producers like Japan.  The US Government is supporting recycling (e.g. new facilities to reclaim aerospace and industrial Ti scrap) as a supply source, but volumes will remain a fraction of demand. Allied governments likewise plan modest increases in processing: Japan will continue its ~55 kt/yr sponge production ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2659047-aerospace-approved-ti-sponge-supply-up-in-2024#:~:text=Japanese%20titanium%20sponge%20production%20amounted,domestic%20consumers%2C%20weighed%20on%20volumes)), and Europe is investing in recycling infrastructure (though currently EU scrap is often sent to the US for melting ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/europe-struggles-break-russias-titanium-grip-andy-home-2024-09-24/#:~:text=thanks%20to%20China%2C%20but%20Europe%27s,S))).  Heavy‐mineral concentrates from allied mines (e.g. Norway’s 500 kt/yr of ilmenite cadre ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=2,45%20%25%20TiO2)) or Australia’s export-oriented operations) can supply titanium dioxide feedstock for pigments, but converting those into metal involves imports or toll-processing abroad.  In practice, by 2030 US/allied supply will likely cover only part of demand.  For example, Europe’s inability to process titanium means it remains “dependent on sending scrap to the U.S.” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/europe-struggles-break-russias-titanium-grip-andy-home-2024-09-24/#:~:text=thanks%20to%20China%2C%20but%20Europe%27s,S)).  Without domestic sponge, US supply will still lean on imports (Japan, etc.) or recycled feedstock.  In total, 2030 domestic supply for US and allies might be on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes (mostly recycled or semi-processed Ti), far below projected demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Heavy‐mineral sands often contain radioactive minerals (monazite, zircon). Airborne or ground radiometric surveys detecting gamma from Th/U can flag placer zones rich in Ti-bearing minerals ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/heavy-mineral-sand-resources-southeastern-us#:~:text=applications.%20The%20extensive%20heavy,mineral%20sands%20in%20coastal%20environments%E2%80%99)). For example, thorium anomalies in coastal plain sands helped map Ti mineralization∥. Dry ground gamma surveys can also pinpoint eclogite-hosted rutile (as in Norway’s Engebø deposit).  
• **Aeromagnetic/Gravity:** Titanium deposits in igneous rocks (ilmenite in gabbro/anorthosite) can be dense and slightly magnetic. Airborne magnetics and gravity can trace deep-seated intrusions (like the Rogaland anorthosites in Norway ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=Ilm%20%20,U%20in%20rutile))). Seismic reflection is also used (e.g. in beach dunes) to map subsurface Ti placer layers.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Traditional mapping identifies paleo-shorelines, coastal dunes, and plutonic units that host Ti ores. Stream-sediment and soil sampling for Ti, Fe, V, Nb, and REE (often co-associated) can outline anomalies. For instance, mapping of Norway documented ~300 Ti occurrences ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=2,45%20%25%20TiO2)) by integrating geology and minor-element geochemistry.  
• **Drone & Remote Sensing:** UAV-mounted hyperspectral scanners can detect TiO₂ polymorphs or iron oxides in exposed outcrops. Satellite multispectral data (ASTER, Landsat) sometimes differentiate heavy-mineral sands by their spectral signatures. Airborne LiDAR can map subtle topography of drift sands or beach sands, aiding resource delineation.  
• **Diamond Drilling & Trenching:** Once targets identified, detailed core drilling is used to define ore grades and thickness (e.g. drilling Norway’s Engebø rutile deposit yielded a 254 Mt resource grading 3.5% TiO₂ ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=Ilm%20%20,U%20in%20rutile))). Trenching along paleo-beaches or placers validates continuity of Ti-rich horizons.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit/Dredge Mining:** Heavy-sand deposits are typically mined by open pits or dredges. In Australia and South Africa, large dredging systems pump sand slurry from coastal pits to wet concentrators. In places like Norway’s Tellnes or Finland’s Sokli, conventional open-pit tractors and shovels extract ilmenite-garnet ore ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=2,45%20%25%20TiO2)). US project (Chemours Tennessee) similarly uses dry-mining of coastal dunes to feed processing.  
• **Wet Concentration (Spirals & Cyclones):** Mined sands are processed through gravity spiral concentrators: high-density slurries flow down log-spirals to separate heavy (ilmenite, rutile, zircon) from light gangue (quartz). Multiple-stage spiral circuits (primary plus rinse spirals) can achieve >90% recovery of Ti minerals. Cyclones are used after drying to re-densify overflow for further runs. These mechanical separators form the “Wet Concentrator Plant” (WCP) stage ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/681470000/iluka-technical-brochure-07-12-09#:~:text=40%20views)) ([www.scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/681470000/iluka-technical-brochure-07-12-09#:~:text=primary%20spirals%20in%20the%20wet,to%20minimise%20moisture%20before%20transportation)) of modern operations.  
• **Dewatering & Drying:** Concentrated heavy minerals are thickened, filtered and dried to produce saleable concentrates. For example, Titania’s Tellnes mine uses vacuum filters to produce dry 18–45% TiO₂ ilmenite product ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=2,45%20%25%20TiO2)). Controlled drying prevents dynamiting of moisture-laden ore and readies it for storage/transport.  
• **Semi-Autogenous Grinding (SAG):** Some sand operations use SAG mills to liberate fine rutile or zircon that wouldn’t separate gravimetrically. Panned concentrate containing rutile/anatase may be ground and refloated to upgrade TiO₂. For magnetite-ilmenite ore, a light roasting or grinding plus magnetic separation is used (as in processing Bjerkreim apatite-V-Ti magnetite ([www.ngu.no](https://www.ngu.no/en/geological-resources/titanium-and-iron-titanium-norway#:~:text=Ilm%20%20,U%20in%20rutile))).  
• **Magnetic/Electrostatic Separation:** Partially reduced (carbothermic roasted) ilmenite can be magnetic, allowing a second magnetics stage to upgrade rutile. Electrostatic separators are sometimes applied (e.g. high-voltage plates) to separate non-conductive rutile from moderately conductive ilmenite.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Dense Media Separation (DMS):** Heavy sands are often separated in a dense media (slurry of magnetite or spinel in water) where heavy minerals sink and gangue floats. This effectively concentrates all Ti, Zr, REE minerals. DMS plants (cyclones or bath densifiers) are widely used in HM plants to pre-concentrate the ore feed to spirals.  
• **Gravity Spiral Concentrators:** Key for ilmenite/rutile separation from quartz sands. Modern spiral systems can process 50–300 tph, with staged primary/secondary spirals recovering >90% of ilmenite. Additional pneumatic dry concentration can be applied in arid regions (air tables).  
• **Magnetic Separation:** High-intensity magnetic separators (HIMS) remove magnetite and ilmenite from rutile-rich streams. In some processes, ilmenite concentrate is partially reduced (oxygen-removal) to make it magnetic, then separated, leaving higher‐grade rutile concentrate ([www.cell.com](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440%2824%2900997-6#:~:text=process%20includes%20various%20stages%3A%20partial,separation%20was%20carried%20out%20to)). This magnetic upgrading (especially after chlorination) is critical in slag production routes.  
• **Froth Flotation:** In titaniferous magnetite ores (e.g. Bjerkreim P-Ti), froth flotation is used to remove unwanted gangue. For ilmenite, flotation can help purify “hard-to-separate” rutile or anatase by using collectors (e.g. amines) and depressants. Studies note that an arsenic sulfidization step can improve rutile flotation yield.  
• **Hydraulic Washing & Desliming:** Prior to heavy separation, washing cyclones remove clays/slimes. Desliming circuits (<63µm cutoff) improve downstream recovery by eliminating fine silts. For chemical-grade concentrates, attrition scrubbing may be used to break dust coatings on heavy minerals.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **TiO₂ Pigment Processes (Sulfate/Chloride):** Although focusing on metal, TiO₂ production is key to the supply chain. Sulfate processing treats ilmenite with H₂SO₄ to produce metatitanic acid; impurities end up in ferrous sulfate sludge. Chloride processing oxidizes rutile (or high-grade slag) with Cl₂ and coke to make TiCl₄ gas, then combusts TiCl₄ to TiO₂ pigment, liberating Cl₂ to recycle. The chloride route requires ~90% pure rutile or slag feed ([www.cell.com](https://www.cell.com/heliyon/fulltext/S2405-8440%2824%2900997-6#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20main%20industrial,toxic%20products%20and%20require%20serious)). Both methods generate large waste streams.  
• **Kroll Process (Ti Sponge):** The primary route for Ti metal. Purified TiCl₄ is reduced with molten Mg at ~800–1000 °C to form Ti sponge and MgCl₂. This requires multi-stage vacuum distillation to reclaim Mg. The sponge is then melted (via VIM/VAR) into ingot. No commercial alternative has scaled; any domestic production requires rebuilding Kroll plants ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2145390-us-looks-to-revive-domestic-titanium-supply#:~:text=The%20US%20is%20looking%20to,imports%20of%20the%20critical%20metal)).  
• **Emerging Metal Deposition (FFC/Hydrogenation):** Research (e.g. FFC Cambridge process) reduces TiO₂ directly to Ti in molten CaCl₂, skipping chlorination. Pilot work has shown small-scale sponge production without chlorine. Hydrogenation of TiCl₄ (MHD process) is another alternative. These are not yet commercial but are investigated to avoid carbon and waste.  
• **Melting & Alloying:** Melt and refine processes (e.g. VAR, electron-beam melting) are used once sponge is produced, to purify and alloy the Ti. Vacuum arc remelting yields high-purity ingots for aerospace grade. These remain specialized and energy-intensive. Industrial recycling uses well-established VIM (vacuum induction melting).  
• **Electrorefining (Oliver Process):** Experimental processes dissolve impure Ti or scrap in molten salts and recover pure Ti, but none are in wide use today. Similarly, purification of crude sponge still relies on distillation and vacuum melting.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Acid Waste Recovery:** TiO₂ pigment plants (sulfate route) generate millions of m³ of acidic sulfate wastewater and solid “red gypsum.” Advanced treatment (two-stage neutralization with CaCO₃/Ca(OH)₂ + aeration) precipitates Fe(OH)₃ and gypsum ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1626#:~:text=in%20the%20middle%20section%20is,thus%20still%20far%20from%20reusable)).  Further treatment via ultrafiltration (UF) + reverse osmosis (RO) can remove >95% of dissolved salts (SO₄²⁻, Fe²⁺, etc.) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1626#:~:text=50,use%20and%20conserve%20water%20resources)), allowing water reuse and minimizing discharge ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/6/1626#:~:text=the%20turbidity%20was%20,use%20and%20conserve%20water%20resources)).  
• **Sulfate Mineral Reuse:** Byproducts from Ti pigment sulfate waste (ferrous sulfates, gypsum) are crystallized as melanterite, szomolnokite or gypsum. These can be industrially reused: ferrous sulfate for cement or soil amendment (fixing Cr⁶⁺) and gypsum as a cement aggregate or soil conditioner ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351995909_A_Review_of_the_Commercial_Uses_of_Sulphate_Minerals_from_the_Titanium_Dioxide_Pigment_Industry_The_Case_of_Huelva_Spain#:~:text=This%20study%20was%20focused%20on,supplier%20of%20iron%20to%20prevent)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351995909_A_Review_of_the_Commercial_Uses_of_Sulphate_Minerals_from_the_Titanium_Dioxide_Pigment_Industry_The_Case_of_Huelva_Spain#:~:text=formation%2C%20production%20of%20magnetite%20concentrate%2C,immobilisation%20of%20heavy%20metals%20in)). For instance, studies show Spain’s red gypsum used in construction and environmental remediation to immobilize metals ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351995909_A_Review_of_the_Commercial_Uses_of_Sulphate_Minerals_from_the_Titanium_Dioxide_Pigment_Industry_The_Case_of_Huelva_Spain#:~:text=This%20study%20was%20focused%20on,supplier%20of%20iron%20to%20prevent)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351995909_A_Review_of_the_Commercial_Uses_of_Sulphate_Minerals_from_the_Titanium_Dioxide_Pigment_Industry_The_Case_of_Huelva_Spain#:~:text=formation%2C%20production%20of%20magnetite%20concentrate%2C,immobilisation%20of%20heavy%20metals%20in)).  
• **Tailings Rehabilitation:** Heavy-mineral sand tailings (silica sand) are commonly used to revegetate mined areas. Techniquest include silt-laden slurry stacking with compaction, the use of flocculants to settle fine clay, and recontouring tailings beach for drainage. In South Africa and Australia, tailings dams employ polymer aids and constructed wetlands to treat trace metal-laden seepage.  
• **Dust & Fume Treatment:** Titanium processing (like slag smelting) emits fine particulates (Ti, Fe oxides). Modern plants use baghouses and electrostatic precipitators to capture respirable dust. Spent filter dust is recycled back into the process or landfilled. Gas emissions (Cl₂, HCl from chlorination) are scrubbed via caustic towers. Wastepack C  
   (waste-sulfuric acid wash water) may be neutralized.  
• **Spent Refractory & Slag Reuse:** Slag from titanium smelting (rich in TiO₂) can be cooled and milled as “rutile-rich slag” for use in cement or direct feed to pigment chlorination. Obsolete Ti alloy scrap and fused silica crucible fragments are recycled in alloy melts or used in construction aggregates.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The single biggest bottleneck is **domestic titanium metal (sponge) production**.  No US titanium sponge plant is operating today ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2145390-us-looks-to-revive-domestic-titanium-supply#:~:text=The%20US%20is%20looking%20to,imports%20of%20the%20critical%20metal)); the last closed in 2020. Silicon oil coated.  U.S. and European industries must import qualified Ti sponge/raw metal from allied suppliers (Japan, Kazakhstan, etc.) or rely on scrap. The high-temperature **Kroll process** for making Ti sponge remains the only proven industrial method, but it is capital- and energy-intensive and produces large waste (MgCl₂ slag, CO₂).  No mature alternative (e.g. FFC reduction of TiO₂) is yet scaled. In effect, the ability to produce high-purity Ti metal domestically – including requisite vacuum distillation and melting – is the primary technological limit.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In practice, the lack of onshore titanium-sponge production dominates the supply chain bottleneck ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2145390-us-looks-to-revive-domestic-titanium-supply#:~:text=The%20US%20is%20looking%20to,imports%20of%20the%20critical%20metal)). The traditional Kroll process (chlorination and Mg-reduction) imposes high costs, energy use and environmental controls, and no scaled low-temperature alternative is available. Without new sponge capacity (restored alloy plants or breakthrough electrolytic methods), US/allied Ti production will be constrained, forcing continued import reliance ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2145390-us-looks-to-revive-domestic-titanium-supply#:~:text=The%20US%20is%20looking%20to,imports%20of%20the%20critical%20metal)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/putin-says-russia-should-consider-restricting-exports-uranium-titanium-nickel-2024-09-11/#:~:text=Russia%20is%20also%20a%20key,are%20France%2C%20China%2C%20and%20Germany)). Thus, developing a domestic Ti reduction capability or recycling high-quality scrap at scale is critical to closing the demand–supply gap.
