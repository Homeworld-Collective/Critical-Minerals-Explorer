## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States (Mountain Pass, CA)** – Mountain Pass (operated by MP Materials) is the only active REE mine. It produces on the order of 40–45,000 t/yr of rare-earth oxides (REO) ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=1%20%20,companies%20like%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths)).  Ytterbium occurs in the monazite/xenotime fraction at ~0.03% of ore ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb)). (The prompt’s 17,125 t/yr likely refers to REO-equivalent output; pure Yb would be only a small fraction of this.) MP Materials has announced an “Upstream 60K” expansion to boost production ~50% within four years ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2023-results#:~:text=Founder%2C%20Chairman%20and%20CEO%20of,%E2%80%9D)), but no dedicated Yb separation plant exists yet.  
• **Australia (Mount Weld, WA)** – Lynas Rare Earths’ Mt. Weld mine produces ~13,000–18,000 t/yr of REO ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=3%20%20,companies%20like%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths)).  This carbonatite ore is LREE-rich (Nd/Pr) but contains a heavy-REE fraction (monazite xenotime) that includes trace Yb.  Lynas is expanding output (target ~12,000 t NdPr oxide) ([marketwirenews.com](https://marketwirenews.com/news-releases/lynas-rare-earths-record-production-in-24-mt-weld-ex-6530599415530548.html#:~:text=In%20August%2C%20LYSDY%20announced%20an,finished%20NdPr%20oxide%20per%20annum)) and adding heavy-REE refining (e.g. dysprosium/terbium by 2025 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Lynas%20will%20start%20production%20of,SEGH))), indirectly increasing Yb yield.  
• **Canada** – No commercial rare-earth mining is operating today (REE production projected 0.00 t in 2025 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/mining/rare-earths/canada#:~:text=Highlights))).  Several exploration projects (e.g. Strange Lake, Foxtrot, Chuqik) have identified HREE resources, but none are yet built, so domestic Yb output is ~0.  
• **European Union (incl. Norway, Iceland)** – Essentially zero production of Yb.  Europe has no operating rare-earth mines and relies almost entirely on imports ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/eu-critical-raw-materials-imports/#:~:text=Heavily%20dependent%20on%20imports%20of,disruptions%20in%20critical%20technology%20sectors)).  (Greenland’s Kvanefjeld deposit in Denmark and Sweden’s Norra Kärr are rich in HREE including Yb, but undeveloped.)  
• **Japan** – No domestic mining.  Japan’s Yb supply comes from imports and recycled materials. (Researchers have discovered huge offshore REE reserves: up to ~16 million tonnes REE (REE+Y) in seafloor mud ([www.waseda.jp](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/research/news-en/58329?lng=en#:~:text=amount%20was%20estimated%20to%20be,In)), but no production yet.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Fiber Optics & Lasers:** Yb-doped fiber lasers and amplifiers (used in telecommunications, industrial cutting/welding, and defense) drive major demand.  Fiber lasers often use Yb-glass or Yb-fiber as gain medium ([criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu](https://criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu/minerals/Yb/#:~:text=Ytterbium%20is%20a%20rare%20earth,steel%20and%20fiber%20optic%20cables)).  Pursuant to growing 5G/6G and industrial laser markets, industry forecasts project Yb demand increasing ~7%/yr through 2030 ([www.grandviewresearch.com](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/statistics/rare-earth-elements-market-outlook/product/ytterbium/global#:~:text=Ytterbium%20,Market%20Statistics)). (North America is a leading fiber-laser market.)  
• **High-Temperature Alloys:** Small additions of Yb improve grain refinement and strength in specialty steels and superalloys (jet engines, turbines) ([criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu](https://criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu/minerals/Yb/#:~:text=Ytterbium%20is%20a%20rare%20earth,steel%20and%20fiber%20optic%20cables)) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Uses%3A%20portable%20X,for%20jet%20engines%3B%20infrared%20lasers)).  Yb-steels can tolerate higher temperatures than standard alloys.  By 2030, growing aerospace and energy-sector alloy production will slightly raise Yb demand.  
• **Photonics & Electronics:** Yb is used in infrared-transparent glasses and laser crystals (e.g. Yb:YAG) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Uses%3A%20portable%20X,for%20jet%20engines%3B%20infrared%20lasers)), and as a dopant in β-PbF₂ and other phosphors for LEDs/UV curing lamps.  The boom in photonics and precision sensing (e.g. LIDAR, spectroscopic instruments) is expected to boost consumption of Yb-containing components.  
• **Medical and Industrial Lasers:** Yb-based lasers (e.g. 975 nm diode-pumped lasers, Yb:YAG) are used in surgery, hair removal, and materials processing.  Increased use of these high-power lasers in medicine and manufacturing will add tens of tonnes of Yb demand by 2030.  
• **Defense and Nuclear Applications:** The U.S. and allies use Yb in certain nuclear and defense technologies (e.g. Yb-169 in radiation sources, infrared search-and-track lasers).  Expanding hypersonic and directed-energy weapons programs imply modest increases in Yb needs.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Mountain Pass (US) Upgrades:** MP Materials’ “Upstream 60K” project aims to raise REO output by 50% by ~2026 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2023-results#:~:text=Founder%2C%20Chairman%20and%20CEO%20of,%E2%80%9D)).  If realized, U.S. REO output could approach ~65,000 t/yr.  A new Stage II refining plant (in Texas) is planned to separate heavy REEs (Dy, Tb, etc.) – eventually this will concentrate Yb, though no Yb-specific plant is currently announced.  
• **Lynas and Iluka (Australia):** Lynas will channel more Mt. Weld ore to its Kalgoorlie and Malaysian plants.  Its new heavy-REE circuit (2025) will handle ~1,500 t/yr of mixed heavy oxides ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Lynas%20will%20start%20production%20of,SEGH)).  Iluka Resources’ Eneabba refinery (2025–26) will also process Mt. Weld ore, producing both LREE and HREE.  Overall Australian REO output is projected ~18,000+ t/yr ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=3%20%20,companies%20like%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths)); Yb will scale likewise.  
• **Recycling Contributions:** By 2030, recycling of magnet scrap (NdFeB magnets, which contain minor Yb), lamp phosphors and electronics is expected to contribute to allied Yb supply.  Pilot hydrometallurgical recycling (e.g. acid leaching of NdFeB dust ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=Commercial%20rare%20earth%20concentrates%20have,life%20of%20the%20company%20after))) is underway in the U.S. and EU, but quantities will still be limited (tens of tonnes annually).  
• **New Projects (potential):** Promising HREE projects (e.g. Northern Minerals’ Browns Range in Australia, USA Rare Earth’s Round Top TX, Greenland’s Kuannersuit) may start production by 2030. If developed, they could add small Yb volumes, but these remain uncertain.  

## References for volumes  
Data on rare-earth production and reserves provide context for Yb volumes. For example, global REE production in 2022 was on the order of 210,000–300,000 t REO ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=Rank%20%20,its%20processing%20capabilities%3B%20home%20to)) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Uses%3A%20portable%20X,14%20million%20tons%20in%20Canada)).  In that context, U.S. output (~43,000–45,000 t REO in 2022/23 ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=1%20%20,companies%20like%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths))) and Australia’s (~18,000 t REO ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=3%20%20,companies%20like%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths))) are significant sources.  Yb is only a few tenths of a percent of REO in typical ores (monazite ~0.03% Yb ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb))).  Canada’s rare-earth production is effectively zero (Statista projects 0 t for 2025 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/mining/rare-earths/canada#:~:text=Highlights))), and EU production is also minimal ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/eu-critical-raw-materials-imports/#:~:text=Heavily%20dependent%20on%20imports%20of,disruptions%20in%20critical%20technology%20sectors)).  Japan’s vast offshore resource (∼16 million tonnes REO ([www.waseda.jp](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/research/news-en/58329?lng=en#:~:text=amount%20was%20estimated%20to%20be,In))) suggests future potential, but has not yet contributed to current supply.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Monazite and xenotime (key Yb minerals) contain thorium/uranium.  Airborne or ground gamma surveys can highlight thorium anomalies, indicating REE-mineralization zones. (For instance, Mt. Weld’s monazite-rich lateritic blanket is Th-rich, so gamma mapping can detect it.) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb)).  
• **Geological Mapping & Regolith Sampling:** Mapping identifies carbonatite intrusions, pegmatites or metamorphic zones that host heavy REEs. Soil and stream-sediment geochemical sampling can detect anomalous Yb (or associated elements like gadolinium) indicative of local REE enrichment. Many carbonatite-hosted REE deposits (e.g. Elk Creek, Idaho) were discovered by geochem sampling.  
• **Magnetometric/Gravity Surveys:** Carbonatites and IOCG-style REE deposits often yield subtle gravity or magnetic anomalies. High-resolution airborne gravity gradiometry (as used by USGS) and magnetics can delineate buried carbonatites or intrusive bodies ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/airborne-geophysics-rare-earth-element-deposits-agreed#:~:text=airborne%20geophysical%20survey%20that%20includes,%28formerly%20Quantum%20Rare)) ([www.exaputra.com](https://www.exaputra.com/2025/06/rare-earth-metals-global-production.html#:~:text=1%20%20,companies%20like%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths)).  For example, surveys over the Elk Creek carbonatite outlined its buried shape without surface exposure.  
• **Spectroradiometric/Infrared Sensing:** Satellite or airborne hyperspectral sensors can sometimes spot alteration minerals (e.g. fluorapatite) associated with REE deposits or distinct vegetation stress over REE anomalies. Remote sensing has hinted at hidden deposits (e.g. Brazilian Ibirama).  
• **Geophysical “Mud Logging” for Seabed:** In Japan, researchers identified REE-rich deep-sea muds by marine magnetic surveys and grab sampling ([www.waseda.jp](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/research/news-en/58329?lng=en#:~:text=Researchers%20discovered%20a%20centuries%20worth,sea%20mud)).  Ocean-bottom spectrometers and drills pinpoint polymetallic mud targets (Minami-Torishima) with high REI (rare earth + Y) content.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Bulk Mining (Hard Rock):** Conventional open-pit or underground mining extracts REE-bearing ore (carbonatite, granite, or alkali-syenite).  For examples, Lynas mines Mt. Weld carbonatite; Round Top Texas uses block caving on a large igneous intrusion.  Ore is crushed/grinded to liberate REE minerals.  
• **Heavy-Mineral Separation:** After crushing, ores are processed by gravity and magnetic methods to concentrate heavy minerals.  For instance, MRIs or spiral concentrators recover monazite/xenotime (densities >4.6) while discarding light gangue. Magnetite-rich xenotime can be retrieved by high-intensity magnetic separators. Specialized drum separators and electrostatic methods are also used on ion-adsorption clays.  
• **Flotation:** Froth flotation is applied to separate REE phosphate minerals (monazite) and silicates from gangue ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278161077_Process_development_to_recover_rare_earth_metals_from_monazite_mineral_A_review#:~:text=Bulk%20heavy%20mineral%20concentrate%20are,also%20produced%20from%20%EF%AC%81ne)).  Fatty-acid collectors (e.g. sodium oleate) are commonly used to float monazite from silica/quartz in alluvial or ore slurries ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278161077_Process_development_to_recover_rare_earth_metals_from_monazite_mineral_A_review#:~:text=Bulk%20heavy%20mineral%20concentrate%20are,also%20produced%20from%20%EF%AC%81ne)).  (Industrial plants often float a mixed “sands concentrate” of monazite+zirconilmenite as a feed for further processing.)  
• **Acid/Alkali “Cracking” (Monazite Processing):** Monazite (REE phosphate) is chemically deconstructed. Typically a pressure leach (concentrated H2SO4) or alkaline roasted digest breaks the strong P–O bonds, converting REEs into soluble salts ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=REE%20ores%20such%20as%20monazite,Different%20comparative)). This stage removes phosphate and prepares a pregnant solution for REE recovery.  (Monazite’s stability makes this step energy-intensive.)  
• **Ion-Adsorption Leaching:** Though rare in US/allies, any discovery of clay-hosted HREE (as in SE Asia) would use in-situ or heap ammonium-sulfate leaching. This technique selectively strips REEs from clay, then recovers them by ion-exchange. (Japan’s mud has not been exploited this way yet.)  
• **Biomining (Research Stage):** Laboratory studies investigate bacteria (e.g. Acidithiobacillus) or bio-adsorbents that can leach or bind REEs from ores/wastes. This could eventually aid recovering Yb from low-grade minerals or tailings, but remains largely experimental in allied nations.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent-Extraction (SX):** Multi-stage liquid–liquid extraction is the industry standard for separating Yb from other lanthanides.  Cracked ore liquor is fed through counter-current mixer-settlers with organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, Cyanex 572).  pH adjustments and tailored extractants selectively move each REE into the organic phase.  For example, Lynas Malaysia’s new SX circuit (1,500 t/yr of heavy oxide feed) will separate out Dy and Tb, leaving Yb in the remaining products ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Lynas%20will%20start%20production%20of,SEGH)).  In practice, Yb is recovered by sequential strip stages.  
• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatography:** Small-scale or specialty processes (e.g. column chromatography with chelating resins) can refine high-purity Yb.  These methods (based on crown ethers or chelating resins) are used in laboratories or small plants to achieve >99.9% purity (e.g. for laser crystals).  DOE and ARPA-E have funded research into advanced ion-exchange modules for REE portfolio.  
• **Selective Precipitation:** Impurities (like Th/Fe from monazite) are removed by adjusting pH to precipitate them, leaving REEs in solution.  Conversely, bulk REEs can be precipitated (e.g. as oxalates, carbonates, or fluorides) by adding reagents, then Yb-rich fractions are later separated.  For instance, oxalic-acid precipitations are used to bulk-separate LREEs vs. HREEs before SX.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metallothermic Reduction:** High-purity Yb metal is typically produced by reducing Yb₂O₃ using active metals (Mg, Ca, or Al) at high temperature.  For example, molten Ca metal in a salt bath reduces Yb₂O₃ to Yb metal, with CaO slag removed.  The crude metal is then vacuum-distilled (Yb boils at 1196 °C) to purify it from residual impurities ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01374a011#:~:text=,4)).  (Alternatively, fluoride or chloride complexes of Yb can be electrolyzed, but metallothermic routes are simpler industrially.)  
• **Electrolytic Refining:** Pilot processes have electrolyzed molten Yb chloride/fluoride salts (e.g. CaCl₂ electrolysis) to deposit Yb metal.  This carbothermic or molten-salt electrolysis yields very pure metal and is being explored for REEs.  In practice, it remains largely R&D in allied countries.  
• **Vacuum Metallurgy:** Zone-refining and vacuum arc remelting can further purify Yb metal or alloys.  Vacuum induction melting and repeated re-melting under inert gas also remove high-vapor-pressure impurities. These techniques are used by specialty suppliers to make 99.99%+ Yb ingots for electronics and optics. 

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Mine-Waste Reprocessing:** Acid-leach and SX can recover Yb from legacy tailings and waste rock while preventing environmental acid drainage.  For example, Colombian alluvial-gold tailings containing monazite (55–63% REO) were leached to extract LREEs ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=Commercial%20rare%20earth%20concentrates%20have,life%20of%20the%20company%20after)); similar techniques could focus on HREE/Yb in US tailings.  By processing waste “ore” on-site (using HCl or H₂SO₄ leaching followed by SX), mining sites can be remediated as a byproduct of REE recovery.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Recycling:** Disused magnets and electronics are treated with strong acids to strip REEs.  Studies show NdFeB magnet grinding and direct leaching in HCl or H₂SO₄ can recover virtually all contained REEs without pre-shredding ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=Commercial%20rare%20earth%20concentrates%20have,life%20of%20the%20company%20after)).  Allied recycling facilities plan to apply SX to those leachates, recovering Yb (present as impurity in magnets/lamps) into saleable REO, while detoxifying scrap waste.  
• **Phytomining & Phytoremediation:** Certain ferns and grasses can accumulate heavy REEs from soil.  Experimental phytoremediation projects are collecting REEs (including Yb) from mildly contaminated mine-adjacent soil.  Plants (e.g. brake ferns) are later harvested and ashed, concentrating REEs for further processing. This offers a low-impact tailings cleanup route.  
• **Water Treatment and Stabilization:** Tailings ponds often leach Th, Ra and REEs.  Technologies like ion-exchange columns (zirconium/HREE-selective resins) or lime precipitation can remove dissolved REEs from water.  For example, treating acid-generation zones with lime can co-precipitate Yb as hydroxide, preventing groundwater contamination.  US and EU regulations encourage such zero-discharge controls at future REE plants.  

## References for mining technologies  
Key technical processes are documented in mineral-processing literature and industry sources. Monazite is identified as a principal Yb source ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb)), justifying radiometric/glam mapping in exploration. Heavy-mineral methods (gravity, magnetic) and flotation are standard: mineral-processing reviews detail monazite separation using sodium oleate collectors ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278161077_Process_development_to_recover_rare_earth_metals_from_monazite_mineral_A_review#:~:text=Bulk%20heavy%20mineral%20concentrate%20are,also%20produced%20from%20%EF%AC%81ne)).  Established hydrometallurgical flows (acid digestion of monazite, followed by solvent extraction) are reported in REE recovery studies ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=REE%20ores%20such%20as%20monazite,Different%20comparative)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278161077_Process_development_to_recover_rare_earth_metals_from_monazite_mineral_A_review#:~:text=Bulk%20heavy%20mineral%20concentrate%20are,also%20produced%20from%20%EF%AC%81ne)).  For emerging techniques, U.S. research (e.g. Waseda University) has demonstrated deep-sea mud processing for REE recovery ([www.waseda.jp](https://www.waseda.jp/inst/research/news-en/58329?lng=en#:~:text=Researchers%20discovered%20a%20centuries%20worth,sea%20mud)).  Remediation-focused studies show that REE-rich tailings and magnet scraps can be leached and treated to recover Yb along with other lanthanides ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=Commercial%20rare%20earth%20concentrates%20have,life%20of%20the%20company%20after)). 

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The **separation of heavy rare earths** is the principal bottleneck.  Allied facilities currently lack large-scale Yb-specific refining; existing projects (Mountain Pass, Lynas) primarily target Nd/Pr or only Dy/Tb ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Lynas%20will%20start%20production%20of,SEGH)) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb)).  Ytterbium is extremely dilute (∼0.03% in monazite) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb)), so isolating it requires processing vast ore volumes through complex, multi-stage chemistry.  In short, even if mining expands, the challenging hydrometallurgy (acid cracking plus dozens of SX stages) and lack of domestic heavy-REE plants will limit actual Yb availability for US/allied supply chains.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The main bottleneck is *chemical separation of Yb*, not mining.  No Western plant today can efficiently separate high-purity Yb from mixed rare-earth concentrates ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Lynas%20will%20start%20production%20of,SEGH)).  Monazite ores contain only ~0.03% Yb ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb)), so separating Yb requires processing enormous quantities of ore and tailings.  Until dedicated hydrometallurgical circuits (or recycling schemes) for HREE are scaled up, allied production of Yb will remain a small fraction of its demand. ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Lynas%20will%20start%20production%20of,SEGH)) ([www.cia.gov](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/about/archives/2023/references/strategic-materials/#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20soft%2C%20malleable%2C%20and,Yb))
