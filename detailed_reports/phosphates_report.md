## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
- **United States:** ~20,000,000 t/yr of marketable phosphate rock (2023) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/us-map-counties-4-states-active-phosphate-mines-2023#:~:text=This%20U,USGS%20map)) from about 9 active mines (Mosaic, CF Industries, Nutrien, etc.) in Florida, North Carolina, Idaho and Utah ([revenueagenda.com](https://revenueagenda.com/top-10-phosphate-countries-by-production-updated-2024/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20US%20phosphate%20mining,which%20is%20one%20of%20the)).  Florida’s Bone Valley alone accounts for >60% of US output ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/news/annual-nlcd-assessment-phosphate-mining-and-land-cover-change?amp%3Butm_campaign=news&amp%3Butm_medium=rss&utm_source=comms#:~:text=Phosphate%20Mining%20in%20Bone%20Valley)). Tier-1 producers include The Mosaic Company (FL), Nutrien (NC mines; formerly PotashCorp) and Simplot (ID).  
- **Canada:** Essentially 0 t/yr.  No commercial phosphate mines in Canada – only junior exploration (e.g. Canadian Phosphate Ltd. with BC and Montana tenements) and pilot projects, but no ongoing production ([canadianphosphate.com](https://canadianphosphate.com/phosphate/#:~:text=,quality)).  
- **Australia:** ≈740,000 t/yr (2022–23) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/aimr/preliminary-tables#:~:text=18,Annual%20Mineral%20Summary)).  Almost all comes from Phosphate Resources Ltd’s rock mine on Christmas Island (~0.62 Mt in 2022–23) plus ~0.12 Mt from Queensland (Perseverance deposit) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/aimr/preliminary-tables#:~:text=18,Annual%20Mineral%20Summary)).  Small output (hundreds of kt) also from a stockpile at Christmas and minor South Australian workings.  
- **EU:** ≪100,000 t/yr.  No significant active phosphate rock mining except a tiny gypsum-fluorapatite ore body in Finland (former mine).  In fact, “none [of the major producers] are in the EU, with the exception of Finland where there is a small amount of production” ([eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX%3A52013DC0517#:~:text=Current%20production%20of%20phosphate%20rock,reserves%20identified%20in%20the%20most)).  EU domestic supply covers only ~5–10% of its needs ([farmonaut.com](https://farmonaut.com/europe/phosphorus-fertiliser-imports-in-europe-5-key-insights-for-2024#:~:text=,disruption%20in%20any%20single%20region)) (Portugal/Spain have only low-grade nodules, and most EU P₂O₅ comes from imports).  
- **Norway/Iceland:** 0 t/yr.  Norway has no operating mines (a very large igneous phosphorite deposit was only recently discovered) ([www.miningsee.eu](https://www.miningsee.eu/tag/phosphate/#:~:text=First%20Phosphate%20Corp,support%20production%20of%20up%20to)).  Iceland has no phosphate deposits.  
- **Japan:** ≈0 t/yr.  Japan has no native phosphate rock mining; its entire phosphate fertilizer supply is imported (mostly phosphoric acid or DAP/MAP from Morocco, Russia, etc.).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
- **Context:** Global fertilizer P₂O₅ use was ~41 million t in 2023 ([www.fao.org](https://www.fao.org/statistics/highlights-archive/highlights-detail/inorganic-fertilizers-2002-2023/#:~:text=Nitrogen%20fertilizer%20use%20increased%20by,62%C2%A0percent%29%2C%20to%2038%C2%A0Mt)).  US usage alone was ~3.8 Mt P₂O₅ in 2020 (≈13 Mt rock) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2075753-us-fertilizer-consumption-to-rise-with-acreage#:~:text=Nitrogen%20consumption%20should%20be%204pc,by%204pc%20to%20392%2C000st%20S)).  Assuming modest growth in acreage and yields, US P₂O₅ use might reach roughly 4.0–4.5 Mt (≈13–15 Mt rock) by 2030.  
- **United States:** Current fertilizer P₂O₅ demand ~3.8 Mt ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2075753-us-fertilizer-consumption-to-rise-with-acreage#:~:text=Nitrogen%20consumption%20should%20be%204pc,by%204pc%20to%20392%2C000st%20S)).  Projecting modest agricultural expansion (biofuels, higher yields), one can expect US demand on the order of ~4 Mt P₂O₅ (≈13 Mt rock) by 2030.  This translates into ~13–15 million t/yr of phosphate rock needed domestically.  
- **Allied Countries:** Combined US+allies demand likely rises only slightly by 2030.  For perspective, at 2023 levels North America + Europe/Japan/Australia represent on the order of 20–25% of that 41 Mt (say ~8–10 Mt P₂O₅).  Conservatively, allied (US+CAN+Aus+EU+JP) demand by 2030 might approach ~10 Mt P₂O₅ (≈30 Mt rock) if global demand grows ~10–20% (IFI projects +5% in 2023) ([greatamericancrop.com](https://greatamericancrop.com/news-resources/article/2023/12/07/global-fertilizer-outlook-2#:~:text=Worldwide%20phosphorus%20fertilizer%20consumption%20is,below%20the%20record%202020%20levels)) ([www.fao.org](https://www.fao.org/statistics/highlights-archive/highlights-detail/inorganic-fertilizers-2002-2023/#:~:text=Nitrogen%20fertilizer%20use%20increased%20by,62%C2%A0percent%29%2C%20to%2038%C2%A0Mt)).  The EU by itself imports thousands of kt P₂O₅ (farm inputs), with its sole mine providing only ~5–10% of demand ([farmonaut.com](https://farmonaut.com/europe/phosphorus-fertiliser-imports-in-europe-5-key-insights-for-2024#:~:text=,disruption%20in%20any%20single%20region)), so its 2030 demand remains ~3–6 Mt P₂O₅ (10–18 Mt rock) all imported. Australia’s domestic fertilizer P demand is modest (~0.1–0.2 Mt P₂O₅) and largely met by imports of rock or acid despite its own mine.  Japan’s demand (~0.1–0.2 Mt P₂O₅) is 100% import-dependent.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
- **United States:** Domestic capacity expected to remain ≈20 Mt/yr of phosphate rock through 2030 (absent new mine approvals).  Florida, North Carolina, Idaho and Utah mines continue at similar output ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/us-map-counties-4-states-active-phosphate-mines-2023#:~:text=This%20U,USGS%20map)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/news/annual-nlcd-assessment-phosphate-mining-and-land-cover-change?amp%3Butm_campaign=news&amp%3Butm_medium=rss&utm_source=comms#:~:text=Phosphate%20Mining%20in%20Bone%20Valley)).  Incremental gains could come from minor expansions of Mosaic/Nutrien facilities, but large growth is unlikely.  
- **Canada:** Remains 0 t/yr (no active projects).  Possible new ventures (e.g. in BC, Montana) have not reached production.  
- **Australia:** Continue ≈0.7–0.8 Mt/yr (Christmas Island, Queensland).  Phosphate Resources aims to fully ramp Christmas Island (~0.6 Mt/yr) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/aimr/preliminary-tables#:~:text=18,Annual%20Mineral%20Summary)).  Some new projects (e.g. WA’s Christmas Island, or WA regolith phosphate) are early-stage; none guarantee >1 Mt/yr by 2030.  
- **EU:** ≈0 t/yr.  No known mining projects; single Finnish/Swedish trial mines are far below commercial scale. EU will still import >90% of consumption.  
- **Norway:** 0 t/yr (prospective).  Norge Mining’s Kollifjord deposit (70 billion t grade 15–19% P₂O₅) ([www.miningsee.eu](https://www.miningsee.eu/tag/phosphate/#:~:text=First%20Phosphate%20Corp,support%20production%20of%20up%20to)) could transform supply but is many years from production.  
- **Japan:** 0 t/yr.  No domestic phosphate; supply through 2030 remains imported.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Spectral Remote Sensing:** Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging (e.g. ASTER, Landsat) can detect the diagnostic spectral signature of apatite or associated minerals.  For example, remote sensing successfully mapped phosphate-rich apatite outcrops in Egypt’s phosphorite plateau ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/353677371_Successful_spectral_remote_sensing_techniques_for_mapping_apatite_mineral_of_phosphatic_rocks_at_eastern_side_of_Abu_Tartur_Plateau_Western_Desert_Egypt#:~:text=Spectral%20remote%20sensing%20mapping%20methods,Previous)).  
• **Geochemical Sampling & Mapping:** Systematic soil/stream sediment geochemistry for phosphorus (P₂O₅) and pathfinder elements (U, REEs, trace metals) can highlight anomalies.  Regional geological mapping of sedimentary basins (marine phosphorite layers) or igneous suites (carbonatites, alkaline complexes) guides drilling targets.  
• **Airborne Geophysics:** Gravity surveys and magnetic surveys are used to find phosphate-bearing carbonatites and associated ultramafic/mafic bodies. Airborne radiometric (gamma-ray) surveys can incidentally flag phosphorite since many contain U/Th (phosphate nodules often have trace uranium). For instance, the large Nordre Kollifjord (Norway) igneous phosphorite prospect was delineated by modern aerogeophysical methods ([www.miningsee.eu](https://www.miningsee.eu/tag/phosphate/#:~:text=First%20Phosphate%20Corp,support%20production%20of%20up%20to)).  
• **Drilling & Core Logging:** Once targets are identified, diamond and RC drilling with downhole geophysics provide direct ore information.  Core logging (e.g. P₂O₅ assays, fluorescence of apatite) remains the ultimate confirmation. Many successful phosphate projects (e.g. Australia’s Christmas Island deposit) were defined by iterative drilling campaigns based on geology and geophysics.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Mining:** Large open-pit/strip mining is used where phosphate beds are shallow.  In Florida’s Bone Valley, 30+ m thick Miocene phosphorite is strip-mined by giant electric draglines and hydraulic excavators after removing ~15–50 ft of overburden ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/news/annual-nlcd-assessment-phosphate-mining-and-land-cover-change?amp%3Butm_campaign=news&amp%3Butm_medium=rss&utm_source=comms#:~:text=In%20Bone%20Valley%2C%20the%20geologic,of%20the%20rest%20was%20grassland%2Fshrubland)).  Ore is trucked or piped for processing. Androsite and superficial flat-bench mining are typical in U.S. deposits.  
• **Hydraulic Dredging:** In very shallow wet deposits (Florida), draglines sometimes dig wetlands that are flooded to form slurry ponds. Barren/ponded areas on reclaimed Bone Valley mines (gray/brown to blue water) reflect the use of large dragline dredges and slurry pipelines ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/news/annual-nlcd-assessment-phosphate-mining-and-land-cover-change?amp%3Butm_campaign=news&amp%3Butm_medium=rss&utm_source=comms#:~:text=Annual%20NLCD%20Land%20Cover%20for,dark%20tan)).  Boreholes may also be jet-mined (pressurized water) to fluidize ore for pumping.  
• **Underground/Room-and-Pillar:** In steeper or deeper hard-rock deposits, like Idaho’s siliceous carbonatites (e.g. Simplot’s Smoky Canyon/Utah’s Sheep Creek), underground cut-and-fill or room-and-pillar mining is used.  Drill/blast and heavy loaders recover the ore; ground support or backfill is added. (No surface quote available, but this is standard in deep phosphate mines.)  
• **Continuous Haulage:** Modern mines use belt conveyors and slurry pipelines to move ore to beneficiation plants. For example, Florida mines employ slurry pipelines (pumping water-ore mix) to wet concentrators tens of kilometers from pit. This reduces trucking and dust.

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Flotation:** Froth flotation is the primary method. Crushed phosphate rock is treated in flotation cells with amine-type or fatty-acid collectors.  Apatite (phosphate) is rendered hydrophobic and bubbles to the top, while silicate and carbonate gangue sink ([www.zoneding.com](https://www.zoneding.com/phosphate-rock-beneficiation.html#:~:text=,This%20removes%20organic)).  This step yields a phosphate concentrate (~30–35% P₂O₅) by removing silica, carbonates, and clays.  
• **Gravity Separation:** Spirals, shaking tables or jigs are used first or between stages to remove coarse quartz/sand from the ore slurry. Denser apatite grains settle faster than light clay/silt, so spiral classifiers can pre-concentrate the ore or de-sand flotation feed. (Gravity pre-concentration reduces slurry volume to the flotation circuit.)  
• **Magnetic Separation:** Phosphate minerals are weakly magnetic, so magnetic separation is generally not used to concentrate them.  However, if the ore contains iron-rich impurities (ilmenite, magnetite), low-intensity magnetic separators can recover those.  In practice, U.S. plants use only flotation and gravity – magnetic separation is “limited” for P rock ([www.zoneding.com](https://www.zoneding.com/phosphate-rock-beneficiation.html#:~:text=Equipment%20%20,Simple%20and)).  
• **Desliming & Washing:** Fine clays and ultrafines are removed by hydrocyclones or thickening ponds.  Many plants include desliming cyclones to rinse out clays that foul chemical processing. Clean water washing is also applied to meet process requirements for subsequent acidulation.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Wet Phosphoric Acid Production:** The dominant refining method is sulfuric-acid digester (“wet-process”) reactors.  Crushed phosphate rock reacts with concentrated H₂SO₄, producing phosphoric acid (typically ~32–35% P₂O₅) and gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) precipitate.  This occurs in multi-stage acidulation plants.  (Global phosphoric acid output was ~84.8 Mt P₂O₅ in 2023 ([greatamericancrop.com](https://greatamericancrop.com/news-resources/article/2023/12/07/global-fertilizer-outlook-2#:~:text=World%20nutrient%20supplies%20have%20increased,which%20fertilizer%20prices%20increased%20dramatically)).)  Filtration or belt presses remove gypsum.  Some modern plants filter acid with diatomaceous earth or use solvent extraction to remove trace U/Th.  
• **Impurity Removal:** Cadmium and uranium, present in many phosphate rocks, must be addressed.  Options include precipitation (e.g. adding H₂S to phosphoric acid to form CdS), solvent extraction or ion-exchange to scrub Cd/U from acid, or high-temperature calcination to drive off Cd.  Currently, cost-effective Cd removal remains a challenge for industry ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363271882_CADMIUM_IN_PHOSPHOROUS_FERTILIZERS_BALANCE_AND_TRENDS#:~:text=also%20outlines%20the%20technological%20aspects,an%20economic%20and%20available%20technology)).  Low-Cd feedstock is preferred in sensitive markets (EU).  
• **Ammoniation to Fertilizer:** Purified phosphoric acid is reacted with ammonia to produce solid fertilizers.  For example, neutralizing in MAP/DAP granulators forms diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) granules.  These processes require controlled cooling/crystallization towers and agglomeration drums.  Finishing steps include drying, granule coating and sizing.  (Some plants co-produce simple superphosphates by reacting rock with acid on a conveyor and drying.)  
• **Thermal Process (niche):** A minor route is the “thermal process” to make ultra-pure phosphoric acid: phosphate rock is fed to an electric arc furnace to produce elemental P₂ (white P), which is burned to P₂O₅ and rehydrated.  This yields very pure acid (for food/semiconductor use).  Commercial plants (e.g. in Idaho) use this for ultra–high-purity products, but it is extremely energy-intensive and not used for bulk fertilizer.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Mine Land Reclamation:** Federal/state regulations mandate reclamation.  For example, Florida’s Bone Valley mines are progressively backfilled with overburden/sterile tailings and graded to restore contours.  After mining ceases, pits are landscaped and revegetated with native grasses and wetlands.  USGS imagery shows former phosphate pits now green again or landscaped water bodies ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/news/annual-nlcd-assessment-phosphate-mining-and-land-cover-change?amp%3Butm_campaign=news&amp%3Butm_medium=rss&utm_source=comms#:~:text=land,Some%20lakes)).  Typical practice is to let mined-out pits form lakes or wetlands, then stabilize shorelines.  
• **Tailings and Waste Management:** Phosphogypsum waste (from acid plants) is neutralized and stored in lined stacks or used as construction fill where allowed (no U.S. reuse, EU limited to <1%).  Technologies include vacuum/pressure filtration of gypsum to reduce volume, and covering stacks to prevent radon release.  New research explores gypsum recycling (in cement or roads) to shrink the waste footprint.  
• **Water Treatment:** Mining and processing water (which may carry suspended fines, fluoride, radionuclides) is treated before release.  Methods include settling ponds, flocculation (adding coagulant to precipitate phosphates), and constructed wetlands to biologically remove residual P and heavy metals.  Acidic runoff is neutralized with limestone.  Some operations reuse tail-waters extensively to minimize discharge.  
• **Ecological Controls:** Dust suppression (water spray) and revegetation prevent erosion of bare phosphate soils. On-site lime treatment or microbial inoculation can immobilize residual heavy metals.  In agriculture, phosphorus runoff issues are addressed by buffer-strips and P-adsorbent materials, though these are downstream of mining rather than extraction.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The primary bottleneck is **domestic resource availability and feedstock quality**, not extraction machinery.  US and allied phosphate production cannot grow substantially without new economically viable discoveries or sources.  For example, the EU’s single domestic mine provides only ~5–10% of its demand ([farmonaut.com](https://farmonaut.com/europe/phosphorus-fertiliser-imports-in-europe-5-key-insights-for-2024#:~:text=,disruption%20in%20any%20single%20region)), forcing heavy reliance on imports.  Likewise, the huge Norwegian phosphate discovery (70 billion t) ([www.miningsee.eu](https://www.miningsee.eu/tag/phosphate/#:~:text=First%20Phosphate%20Corp,support%20production%20of%20up%20to)) remains years from production.  In parallel, processing constraints like cadmium removal are critical: cost‐effective **Cd/U scrubbing** from phosphoric acid is still an unsolved challenge ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363271882_CADMIUM_IN_PHOSPHOROUS_FERTILIZERS_BALANCE_AND_TRENDS#:~:text=also%20outlines%20the%20technological%20aspects,an%20economic%20and%20available%20technology)), limiting which ores can be used.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In summary, the alliance’s phosphate supply is fundamentally constrained by geology and feedstock limits.  No major new low-impact phosphate mines exist in Europe or North America, so production depends on a handful of aging U.S./Australian mines ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/us-map-counties-4-states-active-phosphate-mines-2023#:~:text=This%20U,USGS%20map)).  Without breakthroughs in **resource discovery** (e.g. exploiting Norway’s deposit ([www.miningsee.eu](https://www.miningsee.eu/tag/phosphate/#:~:text=First%20Phosphate%20Corp,support%20production%20of%20up%20to)) or a shift to efficient phosphorus recycling technologies), allied production capacity will remain fixed.  Processes to remove toxic impurities (especially cadmium) from phosphoric acid ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363271882_CADMIUM_IN_PHOSPHOROUS_FERTILIZERS_BALANCE_AND_TRENDS#:~:text=also%20outlines%20the%20technological%20aspects,an%20economic%20and%20available%20technology)) are also bottlenecks, since they restrict use of abundant but high-metal-content phosphate ores.
