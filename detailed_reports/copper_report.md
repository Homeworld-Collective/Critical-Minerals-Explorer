## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** ~1.1 million t (2023) ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=Ranking%20%20,5)) from ~31 mines. Major operations include Freeport-McMoRan’s **Morenci** (AZ) (~0.36 Mt in 2023 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L921%20Morenci%E2%80%99s%20production%2C,pounds%20of%20molybdenum%20in%202021))), Magma (Ray) AZ (ASARCO), **Bagdad** AZ (FCX), **Kennecott** UT (Rio Tinto), **Sierrita** AZ, **Chino/Tyrone** NM (Hudbay), and the **Miami** (AZ Mining/ASARCO) mine. These large porphyry mines (Bingham Canyon/Kennecott, Morenci, Sierrita, Bagdad) plus mills and SX/EW plants (e.g. Morenci’s two 132,000 tpd concentrator mills ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=The%20Morenci%20operation%20consists%20of,leaching%20system%3B%20four%20SX%20plants)) and a 72,500 tpd SX/EW leach pad ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=The%20Morenci%20operation%20consists%20of,leaching%20system%3B%20four%20SX%20plants))) provided U.S. output.  
• **Canada:** 508,250 t in 2023 ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=Key%20facts)), from ~15 mines. Major producers include Teck Resources (Highland Valley ~~175 kt), Glencore (Sudbury Ni/Cu ~~150 kt), First Quantum (Copper Mountain ~~48 kt), Capstone (Moraine ~~10 kt) and others. British Columbia (Highland Valley) and Ontario (Sudbury) account for ~90% of Canada’s copper ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=Key%20facts)).  
• **Australia:** 810 kt (2022) ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=7%20%20,3)) via giant porphyry mines. BHP-Olympic Dam (~250 kt), Newcrest-Cadia (~190 kt), OZ Minerals-Prominent Hill/Carrapateena (~80 kt), and others (e.g. Northparkes, Ernest Henry) dominate. Australian production is mostly primary copper from large sulfide deposits.  
• **European Union:** ≈0.5 Mt. Poland’s KGHM (Lubin/Legnica) is by far the largest in Europe; planned 2025 output ~392,300 t ([news.metal.com](https://news.metal.com/newscontent/103248289/polands-largest-copper-producer-kghm-is-expected-to-produce-392300-mt-of-copper-this-year#:~:text=Poland%27s%20largest%20copper%20producer%20KGHM,%28Webstock%20Inc)). Other EU producers (Spain, Sweden, Finland, Greece) collectively add perhaps 100–150 kt. (E.g. First Quantum’s Spanish operations, Boliden Mines in Sweden/Finland.)  
• **Norway/Iceland:** Negligible current output. Norway’s Nussir mine (Agua Dulce deposit) is expected to start ~2024–25 (projected ~0.04 Mt/yr), but no large-scale production exists yet. Iceland has no active copper mines.  
• **Japan:** Essentially 0 t (no domestic copper mining). Japan’s entire copper needs are met by imports and scrap; there are no primary copper ore mines in Japan ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/ja/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2544610-japan-s-jogmec-starts-copper-exploration-in-ecuador#:~:text=Japan%20is%20aiming%20to%20secure,use%20of%204%2C624t%20in%202018)). (Japan’s refined production is from imported concentrate and secondary sources.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Applications Rise – EVs & Charging:** Copper demand for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure is projected to soar. EVs use ~80–100 kg Cu each (windings, cables) plus charging stations (~10–20 t each). Antofagasta estimates global EV copper demand growing from ~0.2 Mt today to ~2.0 Mt by 2030 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/1643862-copper-demand-from-evs-to-increase-tenfold-by-2030#:~:text=Current%20copper%20demand%20from%20electric,chief%20executive%20Ivan%20Arriagada%20said)).  If U.S., EU, Japan share ~30% of EV deployments, that implies ~0.6 Mt of copper for EVs in these regions by 2030.  
• **Renewable Energy & Grids:** Wind turbines and solar PV require Cu (generators, inverters, cabling).  Global “green power” demand is forecast ≈2.5 Mt by 2030 (7.9% of total demand ([www.fitchsolutions.com](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/commodities/copper-how-much-will-green-transition-impact-demand-24-06-2021#:~:text=Non,%7C%2050.6))).  The U.S. and allies expanding renewables (onshore/offshore wind, solar farms, grid upgrades) may use ~0.5–1.0 Mt by 2030.  
• **Construction/Infrastructure:** Building wiring, plumbing, and telecom remain the largest non‐green sector (~50–60% of use ([www.fitchsolutions.com](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/commodities/copper-how-much-will-green-transition-impact-demand-24-06-2021#:~:text=Copper%20Demand%2C%20By%20Segment%20%282020e))).  U.S/EU/Japan industrial/urban infrastructures consume several Mt today.  Assuming modest growth, this legacy demand (~2–3 Mt in 2023) might reach ~3–4 Mt by 2030.  
• **Overall Forecast:**  Global copper demand ~31.7 Mt by 2030 ([www.fitchsolutions.com](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/commodities/copper-how-much-will-green-transition-impact-demand-24-06-2021#:~:text=,growth%20in%20the%20medium%20term)).  U.S. consumption alone is currently ~1.8–2.0 Mt (refined use + scrap); it could rise to ~2.5 Mt with EV and grid build-out.  Including Canada, Australia, EU, Japan (currently ~4–5 Mt total), allied demand by 2030 may approach **5–6 Mt/yr**.  (Fitch Solutions shows “green” sectors (EV + renewables) each at ~2.5 Mt global, 2030 ([www.fitchsolutions.com](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/commodities/copper-how-much-will-green-transition-impact-demand-24-06-2021#:~:text=Non,%7C%2050.6)).)  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **New Mine Projects:** Several planned/advanced projects may add supply. In the U.S., the Resolution Copper project (AZ) is designed to yield ~40 billion lb (18 Mt) over 40 yr ([resolutioncopper.com](https://resolutioncopper.com/project-overview/#:~:text=Our%20aim%20is%20that%20the,of%20copper%20over%2040%20years)) (~0.45 Mt/yr when full-rate), and smaller projects (e.g. Sandfire/Hecla’s DeLamar/Black Butte, Hudbay’s Copper Creek, Nevada’s Pumpkin Hollow, Arizona’s Rosemont) could incrementally boost output.  In Canada, expansions like Teck’s Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 (~0.1 Mt/yr) and First Quantum’s Carmacks are forthcoming. Australia has new digs (BHP’s Jansen copper expansion, South32’s Calidus). KGHM in Poland has near-term projects (West5 deposit) to maintain ~0.4 Mt/yr. Norway’s Nussir aims for initial ~0.04 Mt.  Exact 2030 tonnages are uncertain, but these could raise annual domestic mine output by a few hundred kt/yr beyond today’s base.  
• **Mining & Processing Technology:** Allied mines continue using high-throughput methods. For example, Freeport’s Morenci mill operates 132,000 t/day and a large SX/EW pad ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=The%20Morenci%20operation%20consists%20of,leaching%20system%3B%20four%20SX%20plants)). Adapting block-caving for deep porphyries and improving heap-leach efficiency can increase yield.  Bioleaching trials (e.g. for low-grade sulfides) are emerging but not yet widespread.  
• **Recycling (Secondary Supply):** A significant supply comes from recycled copper.  USGS notes that about half of U.S. refined Cu comes from recycled scrap ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/copper-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Copper%20is%20usually%20found%20in,resistance%20to%20corrosion%2C%20copper%20has)).  Advanced scrap sorting (eddy-current separators, sensor sorting) and expanded collection will raise secondary feed.  By 2030, recycling (office/building scrap, old wire) will likely supply ~1+ Mt/yr in the U.S./EU combined, mitigating import needs.  
• **Concentrate Treatment:** Allies rely on domestic smelters/refineries and foreign tolling.  The U.S. has SX/EW (e.g. Nevada Copper at Pumpkin Hollow planned SX plant) and two large electrolytic refineries.  Limitations in treatment capacity (smelter/recycling bottlenecks) mean some concentrates will continue to be exported for processing. Domestic supply thus includes copper cathode from new SX/EW facilities and electrorefiners, but much of mined output still needs overseas smelts.

The US produced ~1,100 kt (2023) ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=Ranking%20%20,5)); Canada 508,250 t ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=Key%20facts)); Australia 810 kt ([prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://prod-natural-resources.azure.cloud.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/copper-facts#:~:text=7%20%20,3)). Poland’s KGHM plans ~392,300 t in 2025 ([news.metal.com](https://news.metal.com/newscontent/103248289/polands-largest-copper-producer-kghm-is-expected-to-produce-392300-mt-of-copper-this-year#:~:text=Poland%27s%20largest%20copper%20producer%20KGHM,%28Webstock%20Inc)). Morenci (FCX) output was 0.8×10^9 lbs (~363 kt) Cu in 2023 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L921%20Morenci%E2%80%99s%20production%2C,pounds%20of%20molybdenum%20in%202021)). Resolution Copper will yield ~40×10^9 lbs (18 Mt) over 40 yr ([resolutioncopper.com](https://resolutioncopper.com/project-overview/#:~:text=Our%20aim%20is%20that%20the,of%20copper%20over%2040%20years)).  
• **Demand Forecasts:** Fitch Solutions projects global copper demand ~31.7 Mt by 2030 ([www.fitchsolutions.com](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/commodities/copper-how-much-will-green-transition-impact-demand-24-06-2021#:~:text=,growth%20in%20the%20medium%20term)), with “green” segments (EVs, renewables) ~2.5 Mt each ([www.fitchsolutions.com](https://www.fitchsolutions.com/bmi/commodities/copper-how-much-will-green-transition-impact-demand-24-06-2021#:~:text=Non,%7C%2050.6)). Antofagasta (via Argus) sees EV demand ~2.0 Mt by 2030 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/1643862-copper-demand-from-evs-to-increase-tenfold-by-2030#:~:text=Current%20copper%20demand%20from%20electric,chief%20executive%20Ivan%20Arriagada%20said)). US demand may reach ~3.5 Mt by 2025 ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/us-critical-copper-supply-gap-2025/#:~:text=The%20numbers%20paint%20a%20stark,increased%20dependence%20on%20foreign%20imports)).  
• **Recycling:** USGS notes recycled (“secondary”) copper provides roughly half of US copper supply ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/copper-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Copper%20is%20usually%20found%20in,resistance%20to%20corrosion%2C%20copper%20has)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Multispectral/Hyperspectral Remote Sensing:** Satellite/airborne imaging (e.g. ASTER, Landsat, Gaofen) identifies alteration minerals (e.g. hematite, chlorite, clay) over regional scales.  Such imaging has long been used to target porphyry copper and epithermal systems ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/439#:~:text=In%20the%20late%20twentieth%20century%2C,2%5D.%20Porphyry%20copper%20deposits)).  Hyperspectral II data can map absorption features of specific alteration minerals (kaolinite, epidote, etc.) linked to Cu ore breccias ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/439#:~:text=In%20the%20late%20twentieth%20century%2C,2%5D.%20Porphyry%20copper%20deposits)). Remote sensing expedites targeting large exploration tracts.  
• **Airborne Geophysics (Magnetics, EM, IP):** Magnetic surveys locate buried porphyry intrusions (magnetite-bearing Cu deposits).  Electromagnetics/Induced Polarization (AEM/IP) detect sulphide zones (ICG-type deposits).  Modern surveys (helicopter-borne VTEM, drone-based MAG) rapidly cover terrain. In particular, IP surveys highlight disseminated chalcopyrite halos even under thin cover.  
• **Geochemical Surveys:** Systematic soil and stream-sediment sampling (trace copper, pathfinder elements like Mo, Bi) guides drill targets.  High-resolution geochemistry (e.g. mobile metal ion sampling, ionic leach) can detect subtle copper anomalies from depth. Integration with AI/machine learning accelerates processing of large geochemical datasets for prospectivity (e.g. GIS-based convolutional neural nets combining geochem and remote-sensing ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/439#:~:text=utilize%20geological%20geoinformation%20such%20as,discovery%20rely%20on%20three%20areas))).  
• **Data Integration & AI:** “Mineral prospectivity mapping” uses big data (geology, structure, alteration, geophysics, geochemistry) and machine learning to predict copper orebodies ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/15/2/439#:~:text=utilize%20geological%20geoinformation%20such%20as,discovery%20rely%20on%20three%20areas)).  Algorithms (ML, deep learning) trained on known deposits help highlight drill targets. AI also assists in automating drill-core logging (e.g. hyperspectral core scanners to map mineralogy).  
• **Structural Geology & 3D Modeling:** High-precision GPS/LIDAR mapping of fault/vein systems combined with 3D inversion models (MT/IP) helps locate deep orebodies.  Detailed structural interpretation (e.g. identifying deep-seated ring fractures, porphyry centers) focuses further exploration work.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Large‐Scale Mining Methods:** Bulk mining (open pits, block caves) dominates porphyry copper extraction.  For shallow, tabular deposits (e.g. Morenci, Bingham), truck-and-shovel open-pitting prevails.  For deeper/high-grade zones (e.g. KGHM’s Bytom West, new underground at Carrapateena), block caving is used.  Equipment: 400+ t haul trucks and 50–100 m³ shovels move millions of tonnes/year.  For example, Freeport’s Morenci employs 141 × 235 t haul-trucks using 785,000 t/day capacity ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L913%20capacity%20is,ton%20haul)).  
• **Crushing, Milling, and Flotation:** Mined ore is crushed (gyratory/HPGR) and ground (SAG/ball mills) to liberate Cu minerals.  Flotation separates Cu sulfides into concentrate: reagents (collectors, frothers) cause chalcopyrite etc. to froth off while gangue sinks.  Morenci’s two concentrator lines each process ~66,000 t/day ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=The%20Morenci%20operation%20consists%20of,leaching%20system%3B%20four%20SX%20plants)). Column flotation beds and Jameson cells are used for higher recovery.  
• **Heap Leaching:** Low-grade oxide ores (malachite, chrysocolla) are stacked and irrigated with dilute sulfuric acid.  The copper-rich leachate is recovered periodically.  Many US/Mexico/Middle East copper ores (oxide cap of porphyry) use **heap leach + SX/EW**.  Process control (spreaders, drip systems) optimizes recovery.  Large impoundments (e.g. Morenci’s 72,500 tpd heap pad) allow years of low-grade ore to be processed ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/831259/000083125924000011/fcx-20231231.htm#:~:text=The%20Morenci%20operation%20consists%20of,leaching%20system%3B%20four%20SX%20plants)).  
• **Hydrometallurgical (Bio)Leaching and Cementation:** Specialized cases employ bacteria (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans) to oxidize sulphide fines for additional copper.  The Moab Khotski (Bingham) and Iquique (Quebrada Blanca) use bioleaching.  Cementation (adding scrap iron) is used to precipitate copper metal from rich leachates on-site as powder for recycling, though not a large-volume method.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Flotation Concentration:** As detailed above, froth flotation is the primary separation (ore ↦ concentrate). Sophisticated stages and reagents are tailored to separate Cu from co-occurring minerals (e.g. Fe, Au/Ag).  
• **Dense Media Separation (DMS):** Rarely for Cu, but fine crushing of high-grade breccia (plus heavy-liquid media) can preconcentrate some free copper before flotation, especially in narrow-vein or polymetallic ores.  
• **Electrowinning-Solvent Extraction (SX/EW):** Though often classed under purification, SX/EW physically separates Cu²⁺ from leach solution.  Industrial SX uses organophosphorus extractants (e.g. LIX reagents) to pull Cu into organic phase, stripping it to cathode via EW.  This effectively separates Cu from Fe, Al, etc, and from other base metals prior to final electrorefining.  
• **Magnetic & Gravity Separation:** Typically not used for copper ores (chalcopyrite is non-magnetic, similar density to host rock). However, if ore contains magnetite, magnetic separation may remove gangue. Gravity separation (spirals, jigs) is used only in special cases (e.g. recovering dense copper minerals from free-milling ore).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Pyrometallurgy (Smelting/Converting):** Concentrates (~25–30% Cu) are dried and smelted. Modern smelters use **flash smelting** (e.g. Outokumpu furnace) to oxidize Fe and produce a molten copper matte (~60–70% Cu).  Electric or reverberatory converters then oxidize sulphur/iron to produce blister copper (~98–99% Cu).  Final refining involves fire-refining (glass†(chips), slag removal) to cast anode bars.  
• **Electrorefining:** Cathodic refining produces ≥99.99% Cu.  Impure blister copper anodes are suspended in acid CuSO₄ baths and electrolyzed at ~300–350 A/m².  Impurities (Fe, S) stay in solution or fall out; precious metals (Au, Ag) drop as anode-slag.  80%+ of global Cu supply comes via electrorefining ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/corporate/media/news/2025/7/metso-introduces-enhanced-copper-electrorefining-technology-for-production-of-high-purity-copper-cathodes/#:~:text=sustainable%20and%20cost,electronics%20and%20clean%20water%20infrastructure)).  Modern refineries (Metso Outotec systems) use automated anode-cathode handling and solvent reactions (OKTOP reactors) to maximize purity ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/corporate/media/news/2025/7/metso-introduces-enhanced-copper-electrorefining-technology-for-production-of-high-purity-copper-cathodes/#:~:text=sustainable%20and%20cost,electronics%20and%20clean%20water%20infrastructure)).  
• **Solvent Extraction – Electrowinning (SX/EW):** For oxide copper: copper from heaps or vats is leached by acid to produce Cu²⁺ solution.  Solvent extraction using LIX-type organics concentrates Cu from pregnant leach solution.  The loaded eluate goes to EW cells, depositing cathodes.  SX/EW excludes smelting, making 99.99% Cu cheaply.  US examples: Kennecott’s SX/EW circuit for oxide ore, Nevada Copper’s plans for SX/EW plant.  
• **Hydrometallurgy (Pressure Leach):** Some refractory concentrates (e.g. from Norilsk, KGHM) are treated via pressure oxidation (autoclaves) to liberate copper before smelting.  High-pressure leaching followed by SX/EW is used for nickel/copper sulfide middlings (e.g. Pentlandite-PM in Sudbury).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailing Management (Dry Stack/Paste):** To prevent acid mine drainage (AMD), advanced tailings strategies are used.  *Paste and thickened tailings* (centrifuged/high-solids slurries) reduce permeability; *dry-stack tailings* (dewatered, stacked) virtually eliminate seepage.  These require high-pressure filters.  They greatly limit sulphide oxidation compared to conventional ponds.  
• **Water Treatment/AMD Neutralization:** Acidic drainage from Cu tailings is neutralized by lime (CaCO₃/NaOH) dosing or limestone drains, precipitating Cu, Fe and other metals.  Constructed wetlands (using sulphate-reducing bacteria) biologically remove Cu/Ni by generating H₂S to precipitate metal sulfides.  Ion exchange systems can also recover Cu₂⁺ from effluents for reuse.  
• **Emission Control:** Modern smelters have SO₂ capture (sulfuric acid plants) to avoid SOₓ emissions (Burners and converters feed acid plants). Furans and particulate controls (electrostatic precipitators) minimize smelter pollutants.  
• **Land Reclamation:** Tailings and mine sites are capped/vegetated with soils amended for pH and nutrient content. Reclaimed slag and spent refractory can be reused in construction.  Real-time monitoring (remote sensing, drones) tracks stability of tailings dams (mitigating collapse risk).  Diffuse gypsum crust formation on tailings surfaces also reduces oxidation.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is *not* a lack of mineral-processing tech but the *mine development pipeline*.  In practice, bringing new large copper mines online is constrained by permitting, capital and infrastructure, not extraction methods.  For example, the Resolution (AZ) joint venture required ~20 years from application to pre-construction ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/us-critical-copper-supply-gap-2025/#:~:text=The%20numbers%20paint%20a%20stark,increased%20dependence%20on%20foreign%20imports)).  Thus, no single mining or metallurgical “game-changer” is missing; rather, the limiting factor is accelerating project approvals and ramp-ups. 

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Domestic copper output in the US/allies is fundamentally limited by the slow pace of new mine development.  As noted by industry, U.S. mills will need *five* “Resolution-sized” projects by 2035 to meet demand – but Resolution’s own permitting already spans two decades ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/us-critical-copper-supply-gap-2025/#:~:text=The%20numbers%20paint%20a%20stark,increased%20dependence%20on%20foreign%20imports)).  In short, existing mining and processing technologies can supply copper, but regulatory timelines and capital constraints remain the chief bottleneck to scaling allied production.
