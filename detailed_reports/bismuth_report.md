## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **USA:** 0 t/yr. No active bismuth mines or refineries – 100% import-dependent ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)). (USGS notes the U.S. has imported all primary Bi since 1997 ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)).)  
• **Canada:** ≈50 t/yr (2022, by-product from lead/copper smelters) ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,50)). Canada’s planned Nico project (NWT) would add significant Bi output (see supply section).  
• **EU (Allies):** on the order of 50–100 t/yr. For example, Bulgaria produced ~50 t in 2022 ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,50)); other EU mines yield only trace Bi as a lead/zinc by-product. Overall EU production is negligible compared to Asian supply.  
• **Japan:** ~480 t/yr (2022) ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,480)). Japan refines imported Bi concentrates into metal. No known production occurs in Australia, Norway, or Iceland; these rely on imports.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Electronics/Solders:** US demand was ≈500 t/yr in 2020 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/943249/consumption-bismuth-united-states/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20depicts%20the%20reported,to%20approximately%20500%20metric%20tons)). Driven by RoHS/REACH lead-substitution (in solders, alloys), US consumption is projected to rise (to ~700–800 t/yr by 2030) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136822000300#:~:text=Bismuth%20occurs%20in%20a%20wide,of%20minerals%3B%20the%20most%20important)) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/943249/consumption-bismuth-united-states/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20depicts%20the%20reported,to%20approximately%20500%20metric%20tons)). EU demand (e.g. Germany, Finland, Spain) and Japan’s needs are similar on a per-capita basis (Japan’s Bi production was ~480 t/yr ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,480))).  Combined US+allies electronics/industrial demand by 2030 is likely on the order of 1,500–2,000 t/yr.  
• **Pharmaceuticals/Chemicals:** Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol-type) and other bismuth compounds contribute a few tens of tons/yr of demand in US/EU, mostly stable or slowly growing.  
• **Defense/Ammunition:** Uses of Bi (e.g. for radiation shielding, non-toxic shot) are relatively small (<50 t/yr in total) but expected to grow modestly with defense spending.  
• **Miscellaneous (lead replacement, metallurgy):** Secondary applications (e.g. bearings, brazing alloys, specialty metal additives) add incremental demand. Overall allied demand growth is driven by continued substitution for Pb in solders, x-ray shields, and environmental regulations ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136822000300#:~:text=Bismuth%20occurs%20in%20a%20wide,of%20minerals%3B%20the%20most%20important)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **New Mining Projects:** Only one major ally-source is on the horizon. Fortune Minerals’ Nico project (Canada) plans an integrated mine+hydrometallurgical plant to produce Bi by-product (contains ~12% of world Bi reserves ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=facilities%20and%20incorporate%20them%20into,this%20and%20other%20critical%20minerals))). If built (mid-2020s), Nico could supply several hundred tons/yr to North America. No US or EU primary Bi mine is planned.  
• **By-product Processing:** Allied supply will rely on extracting Bi from existing base-metal operations. For example, Cu or Pb smelters in Canada/EU could adapt flowsheets to recover Bi from flue dusts or mattes. (Currently, standard lead refinement does not separate Bi – an industry bottleneck ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)) ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=facilities%20and%20incorporate%20them%20into,this%20and%20other%20critical%20minerals)).)  
• **Recycling:** Domestic recycling of Bi-bearing scrap (lead-free solders, alloy scraps, spent catalysts) could supply tens of tons/yr.  Advanced recycling facilities (in US, EU) would need to install specific Bi recovery circuits.  To date, Bi recovery from waste is minimal absent targeted processes.  
• **Imports (allied-friendly):** Given limited domestic supply, import sources (now largely China/Laos) remain critical. By 2030, allies aim to replace some imports via Canada and potentially friendly producers (e.g. Vietnam/Brazil), but gaps may persist.  

## References for volumes  
• **Global production:** China ~13,000 t (2024) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264975/production-of-bismuth/#:~:text=China%20was%20the%20world%20leader,tons%20in%20that%20same%20year)); Laos ~1,100 t (2024) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264975/production-of-bismuth/#:~:text=China%20was%20the%20world%20leader,tons%20in%20that%20same%20year)). These two countries account for ~85% of world Bi output.  
• **Allied production:** Japan ~480 t (2022) ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,480)); Canada ~50 t (2022) ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,50)); Bulgaria ~50 t (2022) ([worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/bismuth-production-by-country#:~:text=,50)).  
• **US production/consumption:** US production 0 t (no mines) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)). US consumption ~500 t (2020) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/943249/consumption-bismuth-united-states/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20depicts%20the%20reported,to%20approximately%20500%20metric%20tons)) – entirely met by imports.  
• **Reserves:** Fortune’s Nico deposit contains ~4,500 t Bi (≈12% of global reserves) ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=facilities%20and%20incorporate%20them%20into,this%20and%20other%20critical%20minerals)), illustrating the scale needed for new supply.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geologic targeting:** Focus on known Bi-rich deposit types. Bismuth is typically concentrated in W–Pb–Sn skarns or Sn–Au greisens ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136822000300#:~:text=Bismuth%20supply%20is%20strongly%20reliant,of%20Bi%20from%20conventional%20mineral)).  Mapping and targeting granitoid intrusions and skarn-promoting lithologies (as at Shizhuyuan, China and Nui Phao, Vietnam ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136822000300#:~:text=Bismuth%20supply%20is%20strongly%20reliant,of%20Bi%20from%20conventional%20mineral))) guides exploration.  
• **Base-metal prospecting:** Since Bi is mainly a byproduct of Pb/Cu ores ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)), re-evaluating old lead-zinc and copper districts (and their tailings) using modern geochemistry can reveal Bi anomalies. Detailed multi-element soil/rock/stream sampling (with ICP-MS) in polymetallic belts (Pb–Zn–W) helps pinpoint Bi-bearing zones.  
• **Geophysical methods:** Although Bi itself is not radio­active or strongly magnetic, geophysical surveys can locate host-rock signatures. For example, induced polarization (IP) can highlight sulfide-rich skarns; gravity/magnetics can map hidden intrusions associated with Bi mineralization. Remote sensing (hyperspectral) may detect alteration minerals (e.g. garnet, magnetite) indicative of skarn systems.  
• **Data analytics:** Integrating geologic, geochemical and drill data in AI/machine-learning models can improve targeting, especially in complex polymetallic terrains.

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Froth flotation:** Standard method to concentrate Bi‐bearing sulfides (bismuthinite, tetradymite) from ore ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=Metallurgical%20test%20work%20validation%20is,on%20this%20and%20other%20critical)). Icon example: Fortune’s Nico project completed metallurgical testwork on flotation circuits to recover Bi concentrate ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=Metallurgical%20test%20work%20validation%20is,on%20this%20and%20other%20critical)).  
• **Hydrometallurgical leaching:** Bi concentrates and by-product materials (smelter dusts/slags) can be leached under acidic or alkaline conditions. Typical flowsheets dissolve Bi as Bi(III), then separate it. Fortune Minerals plans a hydrometallurgical facility in Alberta to leach Nico concentrates and isolate Bi metal ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=The%20vertically%20integrated%20Nico%20project,a%20highly%20liquid%20and%20countercyclical)).  
• **Electrowinning/precipitation:** After leaching, Bi(III) can be precipitated (as Bi(OH)₃ or Bi₂S₃) or recovered by electrowinning. (For example, Bi is precipitated from solution and cast into ingots in the planned Nico refinery ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=The%20vertically%20integrated%20Nico%20project,a%20highly%20liquid%20and%20countercyclical)).)  
• **Pyrometallurgy (historical):** Traditional smelting routes (melting concentrates and separating metal) exist but are less common now. In older processes, Bi could be separated by oxidizing lead mattes (Bi either oxidizes or partitions into lead bullion which is further processed). Modern efforts favor hydrometallurgy for low-grade Bi streams.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent extraction (SX):** Organic extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, Cyanex® 301) can selectively remove Bi(III) from chloride or sulfate solutions. This allows separation of Bi from Cu, Fe, etc. (For instance, in copper refining wastes, careful choice of lixiviant can isolate Bi in the pregnant liquor. PDF-based Pourbaix modeling shows that high-pH or plain water leaching leaves Bi in the residue while Cu dissolves ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/2/371#:~:text=hydroxide%2C%20and%20water%2C%20were%20explored,Sodium)).)  
• **pH precipitation:** Adjusting pH causes Bi to precipitate (e.g. as Bi(OH)₃) and leave impurities in solution. This step is often used after SX or direct leaching to pull Bi out of solution.  
• **Ion exchange:** Specialized resins or chelating fibers (functionalized for Bi(III)) can capture Bi from mixed-metal streams.  
• **Electrowinning:** Bi can be refined via electrolysis in a chloride or nitrate bath, plating out pure Bi (similar to Zn or Ni electrorefining). This is used when very high purity is needed or to separate Bi from co-dissolved metals.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Vacuum distillation:** Bi has a relatively low vapor pressure. Multi-stage vacuum distillation can purify molten Bi by vaporizing impurities (e.g. Sb, Te, Pb) at high temperature, then re-condensing pure Bi. This physical separation yields extremely high purity (often >99.99%).  
• **Zone melting:** Solidifying Bi ingots under controlled thermal gradients (“zone refining”) drives impurities to one end of the ingot. Repeating passes yields ultra-pure Bi (used when trace impurities must be removed, e.g. for electronic-grade Bi).  
• **Electrorefining:** Post-distillation Bi can be further refined electrolytically (dissolve impure Bi in acid+halide; deposit pure Bi on cathode). This produces very pure Bi metal or dendrites.  
• **Chemical refining:** Impurities such as lead or iron can be removed by selective chemical treatment (e.g. converting them to insoluble soils, borates, or fluorides, leaving Bi in solution for recovery).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Precipitation/Solidification:** Heavy‐metal wastewater containing Bi can be treated by adding sulfide or hydroxide to precipitate Bi₂S₃ or Bi(OH)₃, which is then filtered out. Immobilizing Bi as an insoluble phase (e.g. in cement/slag matrix) prevents leaching.  
• **Adsorption/filtration:** Sorbents (activated carbon, clays, iron‐oxide media, nano-sorbents) can adsorb Bi(III) from solution. For instance, metal-oxide-coated filter media removes dissolved Bi much as it does Pb or As.  
• **Ion exchange:** Strong-acid ion-exchange resins capture Bi from dilute streams, then release it via elution into a smaller volume for recovery.  
• **Phytoremediation/Algae:** Some plants and algae uptake Bi (and analogues like Pb/As). Engineered wetlands or biomass reactors can remove trace Bi from effluents (drawing on knowledge from arsenic/antimony remediation).

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **By-product recovery flowsheets:** The central bottleneck is absence of dedicated Bi recovery in existing base-metal plants. Conventional lead/copper smelters do not selectively extract Bi (e.g. standard lead refining simply carries Bi into bullion) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)). The missing “bi circuits” – designed to float, leach or precipitate Bi from polymetallic streams – are the critical technology gap. For example, the specialized hydrometallurgical circuits planned at Nico ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=facilities%20and%20incorporate%20them%20into,this%20and%20other%20critical%20minerals)) expose what is lacking: without these, most Bi by-product remains untapped.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Bismuth’s primary bottleneck is that it exists only as a minor by-product in complex ores and is effectively ignored by conventional processing. No domestic mine or refinery in the US/allies is currently equipped to produce Bi, so allied supply must come from imports or nascent projects (e.g. Nico) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)) ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=facilities%20and%20incorporate%20them%20into,this%20and%20other%20critical%20minerals)). The lack of cost-effective extraction and separation technology (at lead/zinc/copper plants and recycling facilities) severely limits domestic Bi output. In short, until specialized Bi‐recovery flowsheets are implemented, allied production will remain essentially zero, creating a major supply-chain vulnerability ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)) ([www.stockwatch.com](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C%21FT-3685291/C/FT#:~:text=facilities%20and%20incorporate%20them%20into,this%20and%20other%20critical%20minerals)).
