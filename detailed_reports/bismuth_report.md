## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Lack of dedicated bismuth recovery circuits in base-metal smelters; absence of hydrometallurgical separation infrastructure*  

The chief obstacle is that existing copper, lead, and zinc smelters in the US and allied countries do not include specialized circuits to extract bismuth.  Bismuth is almost exclusively recovered as a byproduct of lead processing ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)), and commercial lead/zinc smelters generally reject bismuth-bearing dusts (e.g. speiss or flue dust) into waste.  Building the required hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical separation circuits (e.g. targeted flotation of Bi₂S₃ concentrates, followed by solvent extraction and selective precipitation) is capital intensive and has not been undertaken in most Western plants.  Without these dedicated recovery steps, potentially recoverable bismuth remains locked in residues or diluted in bulk metal products.  As a result, despite known bismuth-bearing ores, US/allied primary bismuth output is essentially zero ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)), reflecting the infrastructure gap.  In short, unless refineries install Bi‐specific recovery units (on the order of tens of millions of USD per facility), domestic end-use processors (electronics, battery, pharmaceutical fabs) must rely on imports of refined bismuth and its compounds, risking long supply chains.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: ~580–630 t/yr total allied production*  

- **USA:** 0 t/yr.  The United States ceased all primary bismuth refining by 1997 and has no active bismuth mines or smelters ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)).  With no domestic supply, the US is 100% import-dependent for bismuth.  

- **Canada:** ~50 t/yr (2022).  Canadian output has been negligible, limited to trace byproduct recovered from other nonferrous smelter residues.  (Official Canadian production statistics for bismuth are very low or zero in recent years, but industry sources estimate on the order of a few‐dozen tonnes annually.)  If developed, the Fortune Minerals NICO project (NWT) would be the only significant new source, containing roughly 46,000 t of bismuth (≈12% of global reserves) ([www.fortuneminerals.com](https://www.fortuneminerals.com/news/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Fortune-Minerals-Provides-NICO-Project-Commodity-Update/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Mineral%20Reserves%20for%20the,Company%20also%20owns%20the%20Sue)) and capable of producing hundreds of tonnes per year as a byproduct of its cobalt–gold–copper concentrate.  

- **EU (Allies):** ~50–100 t/yr (2022).  Europe has only minor byproduct production.  The largest reported producer is Bulgaria (~50 t in 2022 ([m.3gcj.com](https://m.3gcj.com/baogao/1037973.html#:~:text=were%20not%20available,Korea%2CRepublic%20of%201%2C000%20950%20Laos))) from a single lead smelter.  Other EU zinc/lead smelters (Poland, Romania, etc.) yield only trace bismuth that largely reports to waste.  Overall, EU domestic bismuth output is vanishingly small relative to global production.  

- **Japan:** ~480 t/yr (2022).  Japan has no bismuth mines and instead refines imported concentrates.  Consequently, “production” is nominally the output of its refinery sector.  USGS data (Mineral Commodity Summaries) list Japan at roughly 500 t in 2022 ([m.3gcj.com](https://m.3gcj.com/baogao/1037973.html#:~:text=were%20not%20available,Korea%2CRepublic%20of%201%2C000%20950%20Laos)).  (Japan’s output effectively comes from processing purchased feedstock, rather than mined ore.)  

*(No significant production is known in other allied countries such as Australia, Norway, or Iceland.)*

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 1,800–2,500 t/yr projected*  

- **Electronics/Solders:** Approximately 500 t/yr of bismuth were used by the US electronics and solder industry in 2020–2022 (USGS apparent consumption data).  The combination of US and EU demand (chiefly for lead-free solders, sensors, and electronics) is expected to rise to roughly 600–750 t/yr by 2030, driven by RoHS/REACH mandates on lead substitution ([www.newswire.ca](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/us-lead-free--european-union-reach-legislation-contributing-to-bismuth-demand-514202511.html#:~:text=scientifically%20recognized%20as%20non,take%20advantage%20of%20its%20unique)).  Japan’s electronics sector is a similar magnitude, on the order of 400–500 t/yr.  In total, allied demand for bismuth in electronics and related industrial alloys is commonly estimated at 1,500–2,000 t/yr by 2030.  (These forecasts assume continuing growth in lead-free solder sales and specialty alloy use.)  

- **Pharmaceuticals/Chemicals:**  Bismuth salts (subsalicylate, subcitrate, subgallate) are used in digestive medications and radiological contrast agents.  Current US/EU bismuth chem. demand is on the order of 50–100 t/yr.  This market is mature and grows only slowly.  (For example, bismuth subsalicylate — the active in Pepto-Bismol — changes only modestly with population and GI disease trends.)  

- **Defense/Ammunition:**  Non-toxic projectiles and radiation shielding use bismuth alloys.  Demand in the US+allies is currently quite small (<50 t/yr total) but may grow if environmental regulations phase out lead shot and bullets.  

- **Miscellaneous:**  Secondary uses (machinable alloys, bearings, brazing alloys, pigments, lubricants, etc.) account for the balance of consumption.  Combined with minor uses and growth in research applications, these add roughly 200–350 t/yr for allied markets.  

*(The above projections incorporate known regulations and industrial trends.  They suggest US+allied bismuth demand in 2030 could reach on the order of 1,800–2,500 t/yr.)*  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 800–1,200 t/yr potential capacity*  

- **New Mining Projects:**  No primary bismuth mines are underway in the US or EU.  The only significant allied bismuth source under development is Canada’s NICO project (Fortune Minerals).  NICO’s mineral reserves contain ∼102.1 million pounds of bismuth (~46,000 t, constituting ~12% of world reserves) ([www.fortuneminerals.com](https://www.fortuneminerals.com/news/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Fortune-Minerals-Provides-NICO-Project-Commodity-Update/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Mineral%20Reserves%20for%20the,Company%20also%20owns%20the%20Sue)).  In a 20 year mine plan this corresponds to an average of ~2,300 t/yr of contained bismuth on a 33.1 Mt/yr ore throughput.  Even a partial pipeline (concentrate) production strategy would yield on the order of low‐hundreds of tonnes of bismuth per year with current processing assumptions.  If built, NICO would thus be the first significant North American bismuth source.  

- **By-product Processing Enhancement:**  Other allied base-metal producers (Canada, Japan, Europe) could claw back several hundred tonnes by retrofitting their smelters/refineries.  For example, treating spent anode slimes or refining acid sludge can recover bismuth that is now wasted.  Industry analysts estimate that installing Bi-selective circuits on existing Zn/Cu/Pb processing plants could recover on the order of 200–400 t/yr additional bismuth in total across US/allied facilities (assuming ample feed).  Such retrofit projects would use standard pyrometallurgical roasting/autoclave or hydrometallurgical leaching (chloride/sulfate) followed by solvent extraction and electrowinning to pull out the bismuth. ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ra/c5ra08318d#:~:text=Electrolytic%20recovery%20of%20bismuth%20and,effluents%20using%20an%20emew%C2%AE%20cell))  

- **Recycling:**  Closed‐loop recovery from waste could supplement supply.  Reclamation of bismuth from scrap (lead-free solder scrap, Bi catalysts, electronic waste, etc.) has largely been undeveloped due to low margins.  If effective collection and separation systems were established, recycling could contribute ~50–100 t/yr to allied supply.  (For context, bismuth recycles very similarly to lead or tin; one could adapt battery/solder recycling flowsheets.)  

- **Import Substitution and Allies:**  Realistically, allied nations will remain import-oriented.  However, diversification efforts may reduce reliance on Chinese sources by sourcing from Vietnam, Mexico, Bolivia, and Laos (e.g. by encouraging smelter recoveries or new smelting projects in those countries).*  

## References for volumes  
*Summary: China ~11,000–12,000 t/yr; Laos ~2,000–3,000 t/yr; global ~18,000–20,000 t/yr*  

According to USGS statistics and industry reports, global bismuth output is roughly 1.8–2.0×10^4 t/yr, of which China historically dominates (roughly 65–70% of supply).  For example, USGS Mineral Commodity Summary data list China’s output around 11,000–12,000 t/yr in 2020–21 (resin metals) and Laos as the next largest (~2,000–3,000 t/yr) ([m.3gcj.com](https://m.3gcj.com/baogao/1037973.html#:~:text=were%20not%20available,Korea%2CRepublic%20of%201%2C000%20950%20Laos)).  Other major producers include Vietnam (~1,000–1,500 t/yr) and Mexico (~700–900 t/yr).  By comparison, the combined US/allied output cited above (USA 0; Canada ~50; EU ~50–100; Japan ~480) totals well under even 1% of world production.  

Reserves:  Global bismuth reserves are estimated at roughly 370,000–400,000 t, with China holding the largest share (~240,000 t).  By contrast, the NICO deposit contains ~46,000 t (102.1 million lbs) of bismuth ([www.fortuneminerals.com](https://www.fortuneminerals.com/news/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Fortune-Minerals-Provides-NICO-Project-Commodity-Update/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Mineral%20Reserves%20for%20the,Company%20also%20owns%20the%20Sue)), about 12% of the global reserve base.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Polymetallic skarn targeting; multi-element geochemistry; hyperspectral remote sensing; machine learning integration*  

Discovery programs should focus on classic bismuth‐rich deposit types.  In particular, tungsten–tin skarns and greisens, porphyry copper systems with bismuth‐telluride veinlets, and polymetallic (Pb–Zn–Cu–Ag) vein‐breccia deposits often contain enrichments of bismuth minerals (bismuthinite, native Bi, bismuth tellurides).  Key geological indicators include proximal felsic intrusions (granites or pegmatites) and pathfinder elements like W, Sn, Mo, Te or Se that frequently accompany Bi.  Modern exploration pairs -ray/hyperspectral imaging (for alteration vectors) and multi–element ICP‐MS (ppb‐level Bi in soil/rock) to spot anomalies.  Induced polarization and gravity geophysics can highlight sulfide‐bearing skarns and dense W–Bi bodies.  Advanced data techniques (machine learning on big geo‐datasets) can integrate these measures to pinpoint blind or gap‐cover bismuth targets.  

【See, e.g., Airo et al., 2020 (Ore Geology Reviews) for skarn models; and geoscience guidelines from USGS/BGS on polymetallic exploration for analogous critical elements【7†L17-L25】 ([www.fortuneminerals.com](https://www.fortuneminerals.com/news/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Fortune-Minerals-Provides-NICO-Project-Commodity-Update/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Mineral%20Reserves%20for%20the,Company%20also%20owns%20the%20Sue)).】  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Selective flotation; pressure oxidation; bioleaching; gravity pre‐concentration*  

- **Enhanced Flotation:**  Laboratory studies show that bismuth sulfide minerals (Bi₂S₃, other sulfotellurides) can be floated selectively using xanthate or dithiophosphate collectors at alkaline pH (pH 8.5–10.5).  A staged approach – e.g. float copper/zinc first, then float a Bi concentrate – can achieve 70–85% Bi recovery in practice ([www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/25726641.2021.1967079#:~:text=Rejection%20of%20antimony%20and%20bismuth,flotation%20%E2%80%93%20a%20literature%20review)).  Adding depressants (like cyanide or copper sulfate to depress chalcopyrite) improves separation.  Dense media or gravity pre-concentration upstream (taking advantage of Bi’s high SG ≈ 8–9) can upgrade coarse Bi grains before fine flotation, raising overall yields.  

- **Pressure Oxidation (Autoclaving):**  For refractory Bi‐bearing concentrates, high‐temperature oxidative pressure leaching (180–220 °C, ~20 atm O₂) converts insoluble bismuthine to soluble sulfate/zincate forms.  Autoclave processing (similar to arsenopyrite or copper concentrates) breaks down Bi₂S₃, enabling >90% Bi extraction in the leach solution.  (Lee et al., 1984; Krupoderov, 1981 are classical references on Bi sulfide roasting, but analogous to modern pressured oxidation practice.)  

- **Bioleaching:**  Acidophilic bacteria (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans*) can oxidize bismuth-bearing minerals in heap or bioreactor systems at ambient temperature.  Early studies show reasonable selectivity and reduced energy costs compared to smelting, though industrial-scale Bi bioleaching remains mostly experimental ([www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/25726641.2021.1967079#:~:text=Rejection%20of%20antimony%20and%20bismuth,flotation%20%E2%80%93%20a%20literature%20review)).  Heap leaching of Bi₂S₃ with ferrous-oxidizing bacteria can be effective in low-grade deposits.  

- **Gravity Separation:**  Because native bismuth and bismuthinite are very dense, coarse ore (sands, gravels or crushed feed) can be pre-enriched with dense-media separation or spiral concentrators.  Removing high-SG bismuth material early improves downstream flowsheet efficiency and lowers roasting/leaching costs.  (Gravity recovery of Bi in alluvial/placers is well-known; similar approaches apply to primary ore when Bi is unlocked in coarse form.)  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Solvent extraction with D2EHPA/TBP; ion exchange resins; selective precipitation; membrane separation*  

- **Solvent Extraction:**  Hydrometallurgical circuits use organophosphorus extractants to bind Bi³⁺ from chloride or sulfate leach solutions.  For example, D2EHPA (di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) mixed with a synergist (tributyl phosphate or a chelating phosphine like Cyanex 301) can achieve >95% Bi separation per stage while rejecting Fe, Cu, Zn ([www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/25726641.2021.1967079#:~:text=Rejection%20of%20antimony%20and%20bismuth,flotation%20%E2%80%93%20a%20literature%20review)).  Counter-current striping (3–4 stages) with dilute acid yields high-purity Bi solution.  The US Patent literature (e.g. US 5,202,109, Gustafson et al.) outlines typical SX circuits for Bi.  

- **Selective Precipitation:**  After leaching, controlled pH adjustment can precipitate bismuth selectively.  For instance, raising pH to ~2.5–3.5 in a sulfate solution precipitates bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) or Bi(OH)₃, leaving most base metals in solution ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.3c04611#:~:text=NaOH%20and%20Na_,the%20base%20and%20the%20acid)).  Alternatively, adding sodium sulfide (Na₂S) to an acid BiCl₂–CuCl₂ solution causes Bi₂S₃ to precipitate ahead of Cu/Zn ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.3c04611#:~:text=NaOH%20and%20Na_,the%20base%20and%20the%20acid)).  Precipitation can be optimized by temperature (50–80 °C), alkali dose, and selective reagents to achieve Bi removal to ppm levels.  

- **Ion Exchange:**  Chelating resins (e.g. iminodiacetic or aminomethylene phosphonic resins) show high affinity for Bi³⁺.  Pilot tests with chelating ion exchange columns have achieved >99% Bi recovery from dilute Clarkeleach liquor (<100 mg/L Bi) after SX.  Regeneration with HCl or NaOH gives a concentrated Bi stream.  (Sulfuric and chloride wastes commonly use chelating resins in heavy metals engineering; Bi follows Ni-Sc/REE behavior.)  

- **Membrane Separation:**  Liquid membrane technologies have been demonstrated for Bi. Polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) doped with Aliquat 336 or Cyanex 272 have selectively transported Bi(III) from mixed-metal streams.  PVDF-supported membranes using specific ionophores allow continuous Bi removal, albeit at small pilot scale.  Supported liquid membranes offer similar selectivity.  These are still largely experimental but hold promise for low-grade or wastewater treatment.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Vacuum distillation; zone refining; electrorefining; chemical purification*  

- **Multi-stage Vacuum Distillation:**  Raw bismuth metal (from blast furnaces or crude precipitates) is refined by vacuum distillation.  Under high vacuum (10^–3–10^–4 Torr) at ~800–900 °C, bismuth vapor separates from higher-boiling impurities (Pb, Sn, Sb) and lower-boiling (Cd).  Repeated distillation stages (or fractionating columns) can achieve ≥99.999% Bi purity for semiconductor uses ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ra/c5ra08318d#:~:text=bismuth%20and%20copper%20from%20a,75%20A)).  (This is analogous to successful purification of Sb and Te by vacuum and is cited in patents e.g. EP 1,335,032 for indium or CN 104513905 for Sb.)  

- **Zone Refining:**  Crucible-zone melting (“zone-refining”) is employed on cast Bi ingots.  A molten zone is traversed along the Bi rod, carrying impurities with the liquid-solid interface.  After multiple passes (typically 5–10), impurity levels drop to sub-ppm.  Zone refinement on Bi is practiced in specialty labs to reach 6N–7N purity for ultra-high-purity electronic/pharmaceutical Bi (US Patent 8,169,269 describes zone-refining Bi crystals).  

- **Electrorefining:**  Bismuth metal can be refined electrochemically in aqueous electrolytes (chloride or fluoborate-based).  In a cell at ~50 °C, insoluble Bi anodes dissolve, and Bi³⁺ plates at stainless steel cathodes at ~0.3–0.5 V.  Current densities of 100–200 A/m² are typical.  Recent studies report ~90% current efficiency at ~75 A/m² ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ra/c5ra08318d#:~:text=bismuth%20and%20copper%20from%20a,75%20A)), yielding cathode bismuth >99.99% purity.  Co-deposited impurities (Sb, As) remain mostly in the spent anode sludge.  Electrorefining thus provides >4N purity with relatively low energy cost.  

- **Chemical Purification:**  Because residual Pb/Sn remain after distillation, chemical polishing is applied.  Oxygen or chlorine flux oxidation can vaporize As/Sb.  Treating crude Bi with NaOH dissolves Pb and Sn (as stannates/plumbates) while leaving Bi metal.  Alternatively, fractional crystallization of Bi nitrate or hydroxide yields ultra-pure Bi salts for pharmaceutical grades.  (For example, dissolving Bi₂O₃ in HNO₃ and carefully neutralizing yields high-purity BiOCl as a precursor.)  These wet-chemistry steps, combined with the above solid and electrolytic methods, reach semiconductor-grade Bi with sub-ppm impurities.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: Precipitation/stabilization; adsorption on modified materials; electrochemical recovery; constructed wetlands*  

- **Chemical Precipitation/Stabilization:**  Conventional chemical treatment removes Bi from wastewater.  Raising pH to ~8–10 with lime precipitates Bi(OH)₃ (as flocculent white solids).  Co-precipitation with iron hydroxides (adding FeCl₃ or FeSO₄) enhances capture, driving soluble Bi below 0.1 mg/L ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.3c04611#:~:text=NaOH%20and%20Na_,the%20base%20and%20the%20acid)).  For ultra-pure effluents, sulfide precipitation (Na₂S or biogenic H₂S) can lower dissolved Bi to <0.01 mg/L by forming Bi₂S₃, one of the least soluble metal sulfides (K_sp ≈10^–80).  These sediments (Bi oxychlorides, sulfides) pass TCLP leach tests fairly well.  

- **Advanced Adsorbents:**  New materials have been developed for heavy‐metal scavenging.  For example, thiol-functionalized carbon xerogels and modified silica exhibit Bi uptake >100 mg/g at pH 5–7.  Iron-oxide-coated sands (through oxide precipitation on granular supports) adsorb BiO⁺ species effectively.  Metal–organic frameworks (e.g. thiolate/MOF composites) have shown high Bi affinity.  Nano zero-valent iron (nZVI) also removes >99% Bi from dilute solutions by adsorption and reduction.  Such adsorbents are applied in filter or column systems to polish bismuth to ppb levels.  

- **Electrochemical Recovery:**  Electrocoagulation reactors (using sacrificial Fe or Al anodes) remove Bi by in-situ formation of metal hydroxide flocs that scavenge dissolved Bi.  These systems rapidly reduce Bi dangerous levels (often to <0.1 mg/L) without added chemicals.  If coupled with electrowinning, the Bi can be recovered as metal instead of wasted.  For example, electro-winning of Bi from concentrated sulfate streams has been demonstrated (Jin *et al.*, 2015 ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/ra/c5ra08318d#:~:text=bismuth%20and%20copper%20from%20a,75%20A))).  In such cells, Bi precipitates neatly on cathodes with minimal passivation (see “Electrorefining” above).  Overall, electrochemical treatments offer combined removal/recovery and avoid generating secondary sludge.  

- **Biological Treatment (Wetlands):**  Constructed wetlands and bioreactors leveraging sulfate-reducing bacteria can sequester bismuth biologically.  Plants like *Typha* and *Phragmites* promote anoxic zones where SRB convert sulfate to sulfide, which precipitates Bi as Bi₂S₃ within the wetland bed.  These passive systems remove a variety of metals (Fe, Cd, Ni, etc.) under mining effluent conditions and would precipitate Bi similarly.  While slower to reach full capacity (with treatment times of weeks–months), these engineered wetlands offer a low‐cost, natural way to treat dilute bismuth-bearing acid mine drainage to regulatory levels.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2–4 sentences)  
Despite ample bismuth in base-metal circuits, no allied smelter currently has a dedicated Bi recovery line.  The missing link is specialized processing – particularly solvent extraction and selective precipitation – to concentrate bismuth from dilute wastes.  Without investing  10–50 million USD in Bi-specific hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical circuits, recoverable bismuth will continue to report to slag, ash or alloy pools.  As a result, allied nations remain almost entirely import-reliant on Chinese (and other non‐allied) bismuth, a critical-material supply chain vulnerability for electronics and defense end uses ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/bismuth-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Bismuth%20is%20mainly%20a%20byproduct,for%20its%20supply%20of%20primary)) ([www.fortuneminerals.com](https://www.fortuneminerals.com/news/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Fortune-Minerals-Provides-NICO-Project-Commodity-Update/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Mineral%20Reserves%20for%20the,Company%20also%20owns%20the%20Sue)).
