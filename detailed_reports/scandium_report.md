## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Ultra-low grade extraction; high energy costs; complex separation chemistry*

The chief technical bottleneck is **efficient recovery of scandium from ultra-low-grade sources**. Scandium typically comprises <0.01–0.1% of ore, requiring dissolution of massive tonnages to yield even kilograms of product. Studies note that "removal of the other REEs and iron takes up a large amount of energy" when Sc is so dilute. The processing chain (leaching, solvent extraction, precipitation) is energy-intensive with yields well below 100%, making cost competitiveness challenging. Additionally, producing pure Sc metal/alloy requires costly high-temperature reduction or electrolysis steps. Until novel methods (e.g., bio-extraction, advanced sorbents, or new chemistry) are commercialized at scale, domestic scandium output cannot reliably meet projected demand.

## Key Bottleneck Summary
Scandium's extreme scarcity in concentrated deposits makes its extraction and refining fundamentally difficult. Current recovery methods must process very large volumes of material for each kilogram of Sc, incurring high energy and reagent costs. The key bottleneck is converting dilute Sc ores or wastes into usable metal efficiently – a challenge explicitly noted as "high energy costs and low extraction yields" in technical literature. Until breakthroughs lower these costs through biotechnology or novel separation methods, US and allied production will remain constrained.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~3-5 tons/year Sc₂O₃ equivalent*

- **United States:** Essentially zero. The US has no active primary scandium mine (no production since 1969) and only trace amounts recovered as byproducts. Domestic output is negligible (<1 t/yr) and the US relies on imports primarily from China, Russia, and the Philippines.

- **Canada:** No conventional mine; output comes only from pilot/recycling facilities. Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (Quebec) commissioned a demonstration plant in 2022 to extract scandium oxide from TiO₂ slag, targeting about **3 tonnes Sc₂O₃ per year**. No other large-scale Canadian Sc production exists.

- **Australia:** No current scandium mine or finished production. Scandium occurs in known nickel-cobalt laterite and rare-earth deposits (e.g., Eastern Goldfields, North Queensland laterites), but mining projects remain pre-commercial. Geoscience Australia reports 11.65 kt Sc in ore reserves (JORC) as of 2023, yet annual output remains **0 t**.

- **European Union/Norway:** No scandium mining. Planned projects (e.g., Norway's Fen carbonatite) target other rare earths, not Sc; Fen's goal of ~2,000 t REE/y by 2031 does not include scandium production. Domestic Sc production today is essentially zero.

- **Iceland & Japan:** Zero. Neither has scandium deposits; Japan imports scandium compounds but produces no scandium domestically.

Collectively, all US/allied production = ~3-5 t/yr Sc₂O₃ today, with Canada's 3 t/y demo plant as the only significant output. Nearly all domestic demand is met by imports.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 20-50 tons/year Sc₂O₃ equivalent*

Demand is projected to rise into the tens of tonnes per year by 2030, driven by strategic aerospace, defense, and clean-energy applications. Scandium's value in weight-critical Al-Sc alloys and solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is widely recognized. The Department of Defense cites scandium for use in next-generation airframes and missiles, with growing demand expected in allied military and energy programs. Although precise data are scarce, current global Sc consumption is estimated at 15-25 t/y; scaling Al-Sc and SOFC adoption in the US, EU, Japan, and other allies could push combined demand to **20-50 t/year** (oxide equivalent) by 2030 – several times current global output.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 100-150 tons/year Sc₂O₃ if projects advance*

Assuming known projects advance, **domestic supply** could reach 100+ t/yr (oxide) by 2030:

- **United States (Elk Creek, NE):** NioCorp's Elk Creek project (feasibility study 2022) plans **103 t/year Sc₂O₃** output once in production. This by-product of ferroniobium/TiO₂ processing would yield ~67 t Sc metal annually (Sc₂O₃ contains ~65.2% Sc). Production timeline targets late 2020s.

- **Canada:** Rio Tinto RTFT's Sorel-Tracy plant aims for ~**3 t/year Sc₂O₃** from TiO₂ slag (roughly 2 t Sc metal). Expansion is possible but current capacity remains ~3 t/y oxide.

- **Australia:** Clean TeQ's Sunrise project and other laterite projects envision initial **20-50 t/year Sc₂O₃** from nickel-cobalt laterites. Higher-grade processing could increase output. Timeline extends into early 2030s.

- **EU & Allies:** No firm projects. Norway's Fen (2,000 t REE/y by 2031) is not expected to yield scandium. Japan and Iceland likewise plan no new Sc mines.

Summing these: US ~103 t, Canada ~3 t, Australia ~20-50 t (Sc₂O₃ annual) gives ~126-156 t Sc₂O₃ (~82-102 t Sc metal). If realized, allied supply by 2030 could approach **100+ tonnes of scandium oxide per year**. Without these projects, supply would remain near zero.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Radiometric surveys; geochemical mapping; magnetic/gravity surveys; stream sediment sampling*

• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne/ground gamma-ray surveys can highlight Th/U-rich monazite or other minerals often associated with scandium-bearing rare-earth deposits. Many REE/Sc prospects (e.g., Mt. Weld, Australia) were identified via Th/U radiometrics, since Sc-rich minerals can carry slight radioactivity. Detection of elevated gamma counts can flag potential Sc substrates.

• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Mapping known scandium-fertile lithologies (Ni-Co laterites, carbonatites, alkaline/pegmatites) guides exploration. Geochemical sampling of soils, stream sediments or laterite profiles detects Sc and pathfinder element anomalies. Anomalous heavy rare-earth or yttrium concentrations (via XRF/ICP-MS) often co-occur with Sc. Australian data show most Sc occurrences in Ni-Co laterite systems.

• **Magnetic/Gravity Surveys:** Carbonatites and alkaline complexes (potential Sc hosts) can be identified via aeromagnetic/gravity data, outlining subsurface extent for targeted drilling. Intense lateritic weathering over ultramafics (bearing Sc) may alter magnetic signatures.

• **Stream Sediment & Soil Sampling:** Intensive sediment sampling in prospective regions can reveal trace Sc anomalies from buried mineralization. This method has been employed at various REE projects globally.

• **Drilling with Portable XRF:** Portable XRF analysis on drill core or trench samples allows rapid detection of Sc or proxy elements. Targeted radar or LiDAR can enhance mapping of outcrops.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: HPAL; pyrometallurgical processing; solvent leaching from wastes; bioleaching*

• **High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL):** Sulfuric or hydrochloric acid digestion of laterite ores (Ni-Co, Ti, red mud) at high temperature/pressure liberates Sc into solution. Various projects report 70-85% Sc extraction via HPAL. The leachate requires further processing.

• **Pyrometallurgical Processing:** In projects like Elk Creek, ore is smelted to produce ferroniobium and TiO₂ slag, which concentrate Sc. Inorganic byproducts are removed, leaving Sc-rich residue for leaching. NioCorp targets high Sc recovery via this route.

• **Solvent Leaching (Industrial Residues):** Some producers source Sc from titanium dioxide or aluminum production wastes. Rio Tinto Fer et Titane leaches TiO₂ processing residues with acid to dissolve Sc, then recovers oxide. This utilizes existing industrial byproduct streams.

• **Bioleaching:** Using acid-producing bacteria (e.g., *Acidithiobacillus*) to extract scandium from tailings or low-grade ore is an emerging eco-friendly alternative operating at ambient conditions.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion-exchange resins; selective precipitation; membrane separation*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Organic extractants (e.g., D2EHPA, Cyanex 272, PC-88A) selectively bind Sc³⁺ from complex leach solutions. Laboratory tests report >95% Sc uptake with optimized extractant mixtures. Scandium can then be stripped as hydroxide or pure salt. SX is the primary method for Sc purification.

• **Ion-Exchange & Resin Scavenging:** Chelating ion-exchange resins (e.g., Lewatit, Amberlite) or specialized functionalized materials can capture Sc at high selectivity, allowing purification without emulsified organics. Demonstrations show >90% Sc recovery from simulated leachate.

• **Selective Precipitation:** Scandium can be precipitated from solution via: (a) hydroxide precipitation by pH adjustment (recovering Sc(OH)₃), (b) fluoride precipitation (forming K₃ScF₆) by adding KF/HF, and (c) phosphate or oxalate precipitation. Each method enables specific waste management strategies.

• **Solvent-Impregnated Polymers:** Advanced extractant-impregnated polymers combine SX chemistry with solid support, reducing organic loss. Studies show polymer beads with extractants perform similarly to liquid SX but with improved environmental profile.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Metallothermic reduction; electrolytic refining; Al-Sc master alloy production; vacuum arc melting*

• **Metal Production (Scandium Metal):** Scandium oxide is typically reduced to metal by metallothermic or electrolytic routes. Sc₂O₃ can be converted to ScF₃ or ScCl₃ and then reduced using calcium or aluminum under inert atmosphere. Alternatively, molten salt electrolysis can yield Sc metal. These methods are energy-intensive and operated at small scale.

• **Aluminum-Scandium Master Alloys:** The predominant commercial form is Al-Sc master alloy (2-10% Sc). Purified Sc metal is alloyed with aluminum via vacuum induction melting. Continuous casting or atomization produces Al-Sc ingots for aerospace applications.

• **Electrolytic Refining:** Advanced techniques describe electrolysis of scandium salts to simultaneously refine and alloy Sc with Al. Though not yet commercial at scale, such processes could streamline production.

• **Vacuum Arc/Zone Refining:** High-purity Sc metal or Al-Sc alloy can be refined via vacuum arc remelting to remove metallic impurities (Fe, Ti, Si), yielding aerospace-grade materials.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Bioleaching; resin-in-pulp; biosorbents; membrane filtration; acid neutralization*

• **Bioleaching:** Using acid-producing bacteria to extract scandium from tailings or low-grade ore operates at ambient conditions, lowering chemical use. Early studies highlight potential for REE and Sc recovery with reduced environmental impact.

• **Resin-In-Pulp (Solventless Recovery):** Resins impregnated with Sc-extractants can be added directly to leach slurries or tailing impoundments to adsorb Sc without traditional SX columns, cutting organic solvent use. Solvent-impregnated polymer methods strip Sc³⁺ efficiently with multiple regeneration cycles.

• **Biosorbents & Sorptive Polymers:** Low-cost biosorbent materials (functionalized biomass, agricultural waste, mineral waste) selectively bind Sc from dilute streams. After loading, Sc can be chemically eluted for reuse. Such systems minimize chemical and sludge generation.

• **Nanofiltration/Membranes:** Small-pore nanofiltration membranes or electrodialysis can concentrate Sc from spent leach solutions. While research shows promising Sc retention, high ionic strength requires robust membranes and operating pressure.

• **Acid Neutralization & Waste Recycle:** Standard practice treats acidic tailings with lime or limestone to neutralize acidity and precipitate metals as hydroxides. Innovative bioremediation (constructed wetlands, microalgae) can sequester trace Sc from process water. Acid recycling via regeneration further mitigates environmental impact.
