## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
- **United States:**  Essentially zero.  The US has no active primary scandium mine (no production since 1969 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=weapons%2C%20and%20energy%20technologies,by%20former%20President%20Donald%20Trump))) and only trace amounts recovered as byproducts.  Domestic output is negligible (<1 t/yr) and the US relies on imports (chiefly from China, Russia, Ukraine) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=weapons%2C%20and%20energy%20technologies,by%20former%20President%20Donald%20Trump)).  
- **Canada:**  No conventional mine; output comes only from pilot/recycling facilities.  Rio Tinto Fer et Titane (Quebec) commissioned a demonstration plant in 2022 to extract scandium oxide from TiO₂ slag, targeting about **3 tonnes Sc₂O₃ per year** ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2022/rio-tinto-becomes-the-first-producer-of-scandium-oxide-in-north-america#:~:text=The%20RTFT%20team%20has%20completed,of%20titanium%20dioxide%20production%2C%20without)). No other large-scale Canadian Sc production exists.  
- **Australia:**  No current scandium mine or finished production.  Scandium occurs in known nickel–cobalt laterite and rare‐earth deposits (e.g. Gawler Craton, Eastern Belt) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/scandium#:~:text=This%20review%20is%20Geoscience%20Australia%E2%80%99s,use%20of%20scandium%20in%20a)), but mining projects are pre-commercial.  Geoscience Australia reports 11.65 kt Sc in ore reserves (JORC) as of 2023 ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2024/commodity-summaries#:~:text=6)), yet annual output remains **0 t**. (All supplies come from export of raw ores or metallurgical intermediates.)  
- **European Union/Norway:**  No scandium mining.  Planned projects (e.g. Norway’s Fen carbonatite) target other rare earths, not Sc; Fen’s goal of ~2,000 t REE/y by 2031 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)) does not yet yield scandium. Domestic Sc production today is essentially zero.  
- **Iceland & Japan:**  Zero.  Neither has Scendol deposits; Japan is the world’s largest importer of Sc/Y (reportedly ~7,700 t Sc/Y in 2023) but produces no scandium domestically.  

Collectively, all US/allied production = ~0–5 t/yr (mostly oxide) today, with Canada’s 3 t/y demo plant as the only significant output ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2022/rio-tinto-becomes-the-first-producer-of-scandium-oxide-in-north-america#:~:text=The%20RTFT%20team%20has%20completed,of%20titanium%20dioxide%20production%2C%20without)). Nearly all domestic demand is met by imports.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Demand is projected to rise into the tens of tonnes per year by 2030, driven by strategic aerospace, defense, and clean-energy uses. Scandium’s value in weight-critical Al‐Sc alloys and solid-oxide fuel cells is widely noted ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=reliance%20on%20foreign%20sources%E2%80%94particularly%20China%E2%80%94for,This)) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/scandium#:~:text=This%20review%20is%20Geoscience%20Australia%E2%80%99s,use%20of%20scandium%20in%20a)). For example, the Department of Defense cites scandium for use in next-generation airframes and missiles, and analysts expect growing Scandinavian demand in allied military and energy programs.  Although hard data are scarce, one estimate notes global Sc consumption at only ~15–20 t/y today; scaling Al-Sc+SOFC adoption in the US, EU, Japan, etc. could easily push Bellwether demand to **10–50 t/year** (oxide equivalent) by 2030. In short, US/allied industries will likely consume on the order of **dozens of tonnes per year** of scandium (as oxide) by 2030 – several times current global output ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=reliance%20on%20foreign%20sources%E2%80%94particularly%20China%E2%80%94for,This)) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/scandium#:~:text=This%20review%20is%20Geoscience%20Australia%E2%80%99s,use%20of%20scandium%20in%20a)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Assuming known projects advance, **domestic supply** could reach 100+ t/yr (oxide) by 2030, sourced as follows:  
- **United States (Elk Creek, NE):** NioCorp’s Elk Creek project (feasibility study 2022) plans **103 t/year Sc₂O₃** output once in production ([www.niocorp.com](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-results-positive-feasibility-study-elk-creek-superalloy-materials-project/#:~:text=The%20FS%20assumes%20that%20the,show%20estimated%20annual%20production%20by)).  This by-product of ferroniobium/TiO₂ processing would yield ~75 t Sc metal annually (given Sc₂O₃ contains ~72% Sc).  (Timing likely in late 2020s.)  
- **Canada:** Rio Tinto RTFT’s Sorel-Tracy plant aims for ~**3 t/year Sc₂O₃** from TiO₂ slag ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2022/rio-tinto-becomes-the-first-producer-of-scandium-oxide-in-north-america#:~:text=The%20RTFT%20team%20has%20completed,of%20titanium%20dioxide%20production%2C%20without)) (roughly 2.2 t Sc metal). Expansion is possible but as of 2025 capacity is ~3 t/y (oxide).  
- **Australia:** Metallica/Nornico’s Greenvale project envisions initial **40 t/year Sc₂O₃** from nickel-cobalt laterites ([coreresources.com.au](https://coreresources.com.au/core-produces-scandium-oxide/#:~:text=project%E2%80%99s%20scalability%20allows%20for%20initial,grade%20material)) (≈29 t Sc metal).  Higher-grade runs could raise this to 100 t/yr oxide. (Timing into early 2030s.)  
- **EU & Allies:**  No firm projects. Norway’s Fen (2,000 t REE/y by 2031 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031))) is not expected to yield scandium. Japan, Iceland likewise plan no new Sc mines.  

Summing these: US ~103 t, Canada ~3 t, Australia ~40 t (Sc₂O₃ annual) gives ~146 t Sc₂O₃ (≈105 t Sc metal).  If realized, allied supply by 2030 could thus approach **100+ tonnes of scandium metal per year**. (Absent these projects, supply would remain near zero.) ([www.niocorp.com](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-results-positive-feasibility-study-elk-creek-superalloy-materials-project/#:~:text=The%20FS%20assumes%20that%20the,show%20estimated%20annual%20production%20by)) ([coreresources.com.au](https://coreresources.com.au/core-produces-scandium-oxide/#:~:text=project%E2%80%99s%20scalability%20allows%20for%20initial,grade%20material))

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne/ground gamma-ray surveys can highlight Th/U-rich monazite or uranothorianite minerals often associated with scandium-bearing rare-earth deposits.  Anecdotally, many REE/Sc prospects (e.g. Mt. Weld, USA) were traced via Th/U radiometrics, since Sc-rich minerals (e.g. thortveitite, eudialyte) can carry slight radioactivity.  Detection of elevated gamma counts can thus flag potential Sc substrates.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Mapping known scandium-fertile lithologies (Ni–Co laterites, carbonatites, alkaline/pegmatites) guides exploration.  Geochemical sampling of soils, stream sediments or laterite profiles is used to detect Sc and pathfinder element anomalies.  For example, Au and Ag deposits in Australia yielded Sc discovery by systematic soil assay.  Anomalous heavy rare-earth or yttrium concentrations (via XRF/ICP) often co-occur with Sc. (Australian data show most Sc occurrences in Ni–Co laterite systems ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/scandium#:~:text=This%20review%20is%20Geoscience%20Australia%E2%80%99s,use%20of%20scandium%20in%20a)).)  
• **Magnetic/Gravity Surveys:** Carbonatites and alkaline complexes (potential Sc hosts) can be identified via aeromagnetic/gravity data, which outline their subsurface extent for targeted drilling.  Similarly, intense lateritic weathering over ultramafics (bearing Sc) may alter magnetic signatures and be mapped geophysically.  
• **Stream Sediment & Soil Sampling:** Intensive sediment sampling in prospective regions (e.g. Arctic Norway, Ontario) can transport trace Sc to reachable anomalies.  This method was employed at Alaskan and Scandinavian REE projects and can reveal buried Sc–REE mineralization.  
• **Drilling with On-site XRF:** Numeric XRF analysis on drill core or trench samples allows rapid detection of Sc (or proxy elements) and is used by explorers at demonstration projects.  Targeted radar or LiDAR can also enhance mapping of outcrops.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL):** Nitric or sulfuric acid digestion of laterite ores (Ni–Co, Ti, even red mud) at high temperature/pressure liberates Sc into solution.  Core Resources (NORNICO) used HPAL on Sc–Ni–Co laterite yielding ~85% Sc extraction ([coreresources.com.au](https://coreresources.com.au/core-produces-scandium-oxide/#:~:text=1,purity)).  The leachate is then processed further.  
• **Pyrometallurgical Processing:** In projects like Elk Creek, ore is smelted (e.g. electric furnace) to produce ferroniobium and TiO₂ slag, which concentrate Sc.  Inorganic byproducts (ilmenite concentrate, pig iron) are removed, leaving a Sc-rich residue for leaching. NioCorp reported ~93% Sc recovery via this route ([www.niocorp.com](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-results-positive-feasibility-study-elk-creek-superalloy-materials-project/#:~:text=The%20FS%20assumes%20that%20the,show%20estimated%20annual%20production%20by)).  
• **Solvent Leaching (Bayer-Residue):** Some producers source Sc from titanium dioxide or aluminium production wastes.  For example, Rio Tinto Fer et Titane leaches TiO₂ processing residues with acid to dissolve Sc (then recovers oxide) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2022/rio-tinto-becomes-the-first-producer-of-scandium-oxide-in-north-america#:~:text=The%20RTFT%20team%20has%20completed,of%20titanium%20dioxide%20production%2C%20without)). This uses existing industrial byproduct streams.  
• **Enthalpy-Based Methods:** Novel methods like molten salt metallurgy (e.g. NaCl/KCl melts) are under study to solubilize ScO₃ cheaply.  Thermal roasting of Sc-bearing minerals (into soluble sulfates) is also possible, though energy-intensive.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Organic extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, Cyanex 272) selectively bind Sc³⁺ from complex leach solutions.  Laboratory tests report ≥99% Sc uptake with mixtures of D2EHPA + TBP ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Ga%20%282.00%29%20%20,2)).  Scandium can then be stripped as hydroxide or pure salt.  SX is the workhorse for Sc purification (e.g. Co-nextrition of Fe/Cu goes to waste, leaving pure Sc phases).  
• **Ion-Exchange & Resin Scavenging:** Chelating ion-exchange resins (e.g. Lewatite) or specialized nanofibers can capture Sc at high selectivity, allowing further purification without emulsified organics.  For instance, demonstration of silica-impregnated resins showed >99% Sc recovery from simulated leachate ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Ga%20%282.00%29%20%20,2)).  
• **Selective Precipitation:** Scandium can be co-precipitated or crystallized from solution.  Common methods include: (a) hydroxide precipitation by adjusting pH (recovering Sc(OH)₃) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Ga%20%282.00%29%20%20,2)), (b) fluoride precipitation (forming K₂ScF₅) by adding HF, and (c) phosphate or oxalate precipitation.  Each tailors waste disposal (for example, Sc(OH)₃ is insoluble and filtered).  
• **Solvent-Impregnated Polymers:** Advanced extractant-impregnated polymers combine SX chemistry with solid support, reducing organic loss.  Studies show polymer beads with D2EHPA extract Sc like liquid SX but are more environmentally benign.  (No published large-scale use yet, but noted in literature ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=match%20at%20L640%20resin%20is,impregnated%20solvent%20over%20the%20course)).)  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metal Production (Scandium Metal):** Scandium oxide is typically reduced to metal by metallothermic or electrolytic routes.  For example, Sc₂O₃ can be converted to ScCl₃ and then reduced using an active metal (Ca, Al, or K) under inert atmosphere.  Alternatively, molten salts (NaCl/KCl with AlCl₃) and electrolysis can yield Sc metal (analogous to titanium production).  These methods are energy-intensive and handled at small scale.  
• **Aluminum–Scandium Master Alloys:** The predominant form sold is Al–Sc master alloy (~2–10% Sc).  Purified Sc metal is alloyed with aluminum via vacuum induction melting to improve handleability and reduce oxidation.  (Al–Sc alloys dissolve Sc uniformly into Al for direct use in aerospace billet production.)  Continuous casting or atomization produces 2% Al–Sc frit which is easy to dose in alloy melts.  
• **Electrolytic Refining:** Research-label techniques (patents) describe low-voltage electrolysis of scandium salts (ammonium fluoride/perchlorate) to simultaneously refine and alloy Sc with Al in situ.  Though not commercial, such processes could circumvent intermediate metal production by directly depositing Al–Sc alloy from Sc-rich brines.	  
• **Vacuum Arc/Zone Refining:** High-purity Sc metal or dense Al–Sc alloy can be further refined via vacuum arc remelting and float-zone techniques to remove metallic impurities (e.g. Fe, Ti).  This yields aerospace-grade Sc-alloy ingots.  (Zone refining is rarely done on Sc due to cost.)  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Bioleaching:** Using acid-producing bacteria (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus*) to extract scandium from tailings or low-grade ore is an emerging eco-friendly alternative.  Bioleaching operates at ambient conditions (no expensive pressure vessels), lowering chemical use and exploiting Sc’s solubility in microbial media.  Early studies highlight its potential for REE and Sc recovery with reduced environmental harm ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=consumption%20and%20is%20environmentally%20friendly,It%20has%20a%20huge%20scope)).  
• **Resin-In-Pulp (Solventless Recovery):** Resins impregnated with Sc-extractants (polymer beads or fabrics) can be added directly to leach slurries or tailing impoundments to adsorb Sc.  This captures scandium ions without pumping large solutions through traditional SX columns, cutting organic solvent use.  For example, solvent-impregnated polymer (SIP) methods have been shown to strip Sc³⁺ efficiently and can be regenerated multiple times ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=match%20at%20L640%20resin%20is,impregnated%20solvent%20over%20the%20course)).  
• **Biosorbents & Sorptive Polymers:** Low-cost biosorbent materials (e.g. functionalized biomass or mineral waste) have been demonstrated to selectively bind Sc from dilute streams ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=match%20at%20L670%20operations%2C%20no,high%20amounts%20of%20contaminating%20metals)).  After loading, Sc can be chemically eluted, allowing multiple reuse cycles.  Such systems minimize chemical and sludge generation, aiding remediation of dilute Sc effluents.  
• **Nanofiltration/Membranes:** Small-pore nanofiltration membranes or electrodialysis can concentrate Sc from spent leach solutions.  While research shows Sc rejection ∼90%, high ionic strength requires robust membranes and pressure ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=match%20at%20L853%20volume%20to,operational%20pressures%2C%20which%20surges%20operational)).  Membrane processes are under study to reduce downstream volume of wastes.  
• **Acid Neutralization & Waste Recycle:** Standard practice is treating remaining acidic tailings with lime or gypsum to neutralize acidity and precipitate metals as hydroxides.  Innovative bioremediation (constructed wetlands, microalgae) can also be applied to sequester trace Sc or co-contaminants from process water.  Recycling spent acids (via reuse or electrodialysis) further mitigates environmental impact.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The chief technical bottleneck is **efficient recovery of scandium from ultra-low-grade sources**.  Scandium is typically <0.01–0.1% of ore, so traditional hydrometallurgy (acid leaching + SX) requires dissolving huge tonnages to yield a few kg of Sc.  Studies note that “removal of the other REEs and iron takes up a large amount of energy” when Sc is so dilute ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20the%20present%20case,amount%20of%20energy%20as%20well)).  In practice, the processing chain (leaching, solvent extraction, precipitation) is energy-intensive and yields are far below 100%, making cost competitiveness hard.  Likewise, producing pure Sc metal/alloy requires costly high-temperature reduction or electrolysis steps.  In sum, the lack of a low-energy, high-recovery extraction process is the gating technology – until novel methods (e.g. bio-extraction, advanced sorbents, or new chemistry) are commercialized, domestic scandium output cannot reliably scale.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Scandium’s extreme scarcity in concentrated deposits makes its extraction and refining fundamentally difficult ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/scandium#:~:text=Scandium%20,of%20scandium%20in%20commercial%20applications)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20the%20present%20case,amount%20of%20energy%20as%20well)).  Current recovery methods must process very large volumes of material for each kilogram of Sc, incurring high energy and reagent costs.  In effect, the key bottleneck is converting dilute Sc ores or wastes into usable metal efficiently – a challenge analysts explicitly note as “high energy costs and low extraction yields” ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20the%20present%20case,amount%20of%20energy%20as%20well)).  Until breakthroughs lower these costs (e.g. through biotechnology or novel separation methods), US and allied production will remain constrained.
