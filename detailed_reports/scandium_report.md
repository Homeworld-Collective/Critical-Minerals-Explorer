## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
Scandium is usually present only at parts-per-million levels (often ∼0.002–0.01% of ore) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=5,Recovery)), so “massive tonnages” must be processed to obtain modest Sc output.  For example, one life-cycle analysis found that when Sc comprises only ~0.01% of feed, “removal of the other REEs and iron takes up a large amount of energy as well as material” ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=in%20form%20of%20GWA%2C%20with,been%20identified%20for%20scandium%20recovery)).  The hydrometallurgical chain (leaching, solvent extraction, precipitation) thus consumes large amounts of acid, solvents, and power, with metal recoveries typically <100% ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=in%20form%20of%20GWA%2C%20with,been%20identified%20for%20scandium%20recovery)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379205891_Extraction_of_scandium_from_halmahera_limonite_ore_by_high_pressure_acid_leaching_HPAL_in_sulfuric_acid_solution#:~:text=scandium%20were%2085,6)).  Producing Sc metal or master alloys then requires metallothermic reduction (Ca or Al) or molten-salt electrolysis at high temperature, adding further cost and energy.  In practice, many Sc projects report roughly 70–90% Sc recovery by HPAL ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379205891_Extraction_of_scandium_from_halmahera_limonite_ore_by_high_pressure_acid_leaching_HPAL_in_sulfuric_acid_solution#:~:text=scandium%20were%2085,6)) but still leave significant material unrecovered.  Until breakthrough techniques (e.g. bioleaching or novel sorbents) can operate at scale ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=Compared%20to%20conventional%20leaching%20methods%2C,product%20generation%2C%20less%20energy)), domestic Sc production will remain very expensive and limited.

## Key Bottleneck Summary
Scandium’s rarity and dispersed occurrence make recovery fundamentally difficult.  With Sc only on the order of 0.002–0.01% in most sources ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=5,Recovery)), processes must dissolve or process vast ore amounts, incurring high reagent and energy use.  The required separation steps (e.g. leach-SX-precipitate) are complex and incomplete, further driving costs ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=in%20form%20of%20GWA%2C%20with,been%20identified%20for%20scandium%20recovery)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379205891_Extraction_of_scandium_from_halmahera_limonite_ore_by_high_pressure_acid_leaching_HPAL_in_sulfuric_acid_solution#:~:text=scandium%20were%2085,6)).  In short, converting dilute Sc ores or wastes into pure metal is costly and inefficient.  Until new methods like microbial leaching or advanced adsorbents reach industrial scale ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=Compared%20to%20conventional%20leaching%20methods%2C,product%20generation%2C%20less%20energy)), US and allied production will stay bottlenecked by these technical challenges.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
- **United States:** The US has no primary Sc mine and “has not mined scandium since 1969” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=is%20a%20valuable%20component%20in,by%20former%20President%20Donald%20Trump)). Domestic production is effectively zero (≪1 t/yr Sc₂O₃) and the US is 100% import-dependent.  Current Sc supplies to the US are sourced almost entirely from abroad (mainly China, Russia, Ukraine) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=is%20a%20valuable%20component%20in,by%20former%20President%20Donald%20Trump)).

- **Canada:** No conventional Sc mine exists.  Sc on the order of a few tons per year has been recovered only as a byproduct or in pilot plants.  Rio Tinto’s Fer et Titane unit recently demonstrated a TiO₂ slag leaching process with an output target of ~**3 t/yr Sc₂O₃** (≈2 t Sc) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/can/news/releases/2021/Rio-Tinto-enters-scandium-market-with-construction-of-new-plant-in-Canada#:~:text=Rio%20Tinto%20is%20investing%20US%246,in%20line%20with%20market%20demand)).  No other large-scale Canadian production operates today.

- **Australia:** Australia has significant Sc resources but no Sc mine.  Geoscience Australia reports 36.65 kt Sc in identified resources and 11.65 kt Sc in reserves (AIMR 2023), yet production was **0 t** in 2022 ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=Critical%20Mineral%20,0)).  Known Sc occurs in nickel-cobalt laterites (e.g. Eastern Goldfields) and rare-earth deposits, but none is currently mined for scandium.

- **EU/Norway:** There is no current scandium mining in Europe.  Planned rare-earth projects (e.g. Norway’s Fen complex) focus on other REEs and are not expected to produce Sc.  Domestic scandium output in the EU and Norway today is effectively zero.

- **Iceland & Japan:** Neither country has native Sc deposits. Both import any scandium needed (for example, Japan’s small Sc demand is met through imports).  Domestic Sc production is **0 t** in Iceland and Japan.

**Allied total:** Summing these, US/allied Sc₂O₃ output today is on the order of only a few tonnes per year (roughly 3–5 t/yr from Canada’s demo plant and scattered byproducts) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/can/news/releases/2021/Rio-Tinto-enters-scandium-market-with-construction-of-new-plant-in-Canada#:~:text=Rio%20Tinto%20is%20investing%20US%246,in%20line%20with%20market%20demand)) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=Critical%20Mineral%20,0)). Nearly all Sc consumption in US/allied countries is met by imports, since domestic output is negligible.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
While hard forecasts are scarce, demand for scandium is expected to rise sharply.  Current global Sc₂O₃ usage is only ~15–25 t/yr ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=expensive,demand%20is%20increasing%20for%20modern)), but Sc is recognized as critical for aerospace and clean-energy technologies.  The U.S. Department of Defense and other authorities highlight Sc’s role in next-generation airframes, missile components and solid-oxide fuel cells.  For example, Reuters notes the U.S. DOD explicitly targets scandium (“a valuable component in high-strength, lightweight alloys” used in aerospace/defense) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-awards-niocorp-unit-10-million-build-scandium-supply-chain-nebraska-2025-08-05/#:~:text=is%20a%20valuable%20component%20in,by%20former%20President%20Donald%20Trump)).  Given planned adoption of Al–Sc alloys and SOFCs by 2030, analysts project that combined US/EU/Japan demand could reach on the order of tens of tonnes per year (perhaps 20–50 t/yr Sc₂O₃) by 2030 – several times today’s global supply.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
If key projects proceed, domestic allied supply could grow into the tens to low hundreds of tonnes.  Notable planned outputs (Sc₂O₃ basis) include:
- **United States (Elk Creek, NE):** NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project (latest feasibility) envisions **103 t/yr Sc₂O₃** production once operational ([www.niocorp.com](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-announces-results-positive-feasibility-study-elk-creek-superalloy-materials-project/#:~:text=,rate%20of%2011%2C445%20tonnes%20per)) (≈67 t Sc metal). This comes as a byproduct of ferroniobium and TiO₂ production via smelting.  The timeline targets late 2020s startup, subject to financing and permitting.
- **Canada:** The Quebec RTFT plant discussed above aims for ~**3 t/yr Sc₂O₃** ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/can/news/releases/2021/Rio-Tinto-enters-scandium-market-with-construction-of-new-plant-in-Canada#:~:text=Rio%20Tinto%20is%20investing%20US%246,in%20line%20with%20market%20demand)). Expansion of this process could increase output, but so far only the 3 t/yr capacity is planned.
- **Australia:** The Clean TeQ Sunrise nickel-cobalt project (high-Sc laterite) has feasibility assumptions that Sc₂O₃ output will ramp to ~**20 t/yr** by about year 10 of operations ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2020/08/27/2085171/0/en/Clean-TeQ-Announces-Sunrise-Project-Update.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L206%20,per%20annum%20by%20year%2010)).  (Other laterite projects exist but none have firm production schedules or published Sc recovery rates beyond bench scale.)
- **EU & Allies:** No firm Sc projects exist in Europe; Fen is focused on other REEs. Japan and Iceland likewise have none.

Roughly totaling, the US (103 t) + Canada (3 t) + Australia (∼20 t) yields on the order of ~**126 t/yr Sc₂O₃** (~82 t Sc metal) by 2030 if these plans materialize.  In other words, allied production could approach the low hundreds of tonnes of oxide per year.  Without these projects, however, supply would remain near zero.

## Key Discovery Technologies
- **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne and ground γ-ray spectrometry can flag monazite, thorite or other Th/U-rich minerals often carrying rare-earths (and trace Sc).  High Th/U counts can indicate zones for follow-up sampling, since many Sc occurrences co-occur with thorium- and uranium-bearing minerals (monazite–alloy phosphate, etc.).  Radiometrics have helped guide exploration of some heavy-mineral and carbonatite-hosted scandi­um prospects.
- **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Targeting known scandium-fertile lithologies (e.g. nickel-cobalt laterites, alkaline/pegmatite, carbonatite/REE complexes) is essential.  Geochemical sampling of soils, laterite profiles or stream sediments for Sc and pathfinder elements can reveal anomalies.  For instance, Sc often accompanies yttrium and some heavy REEs, so elevated Y or heavy-REE in sediment could hint at buried Sc-bearing rocks.
- **Magnetic/Gravity Surveys:** Carbonatites, alkaline intrusions and ultramafic rocks can have distinctive magnetic and gravity signatures. Aeromagnetic anomalies may outline buried alkaline complexes (potential Sc hosts).  Where intense lateritic weathering has lowered magnetic susceptibility, combining magnetic and gravity data with geochemical results can prioritize drill targets.
- **Stream Sediment & Soil Sampling:** Systematic sampling in prospective terrains can spot trace Sc anomalies shed from hidden deposits.  This approach, often followed by lower SOIL/rock sampling, is standard in early REE/Sc exploration.
- **Drilling with Portable XRF:** Once a target is defined, drill core or trench samples can be analyzed rapidly with field XRF. Portable spectrometers can detect Sc (and proxy elements) in-situ to quickly steer drilling.  High-resolution LiDAR or ground-penetrating radar can also assist mapping of outcrops and saprolite zones in covered areas.

*(Note: References on exploration methods are general and not individually cited here.  Typical REE/Sc guidebooks and surveys cover these techniques.)*

## Key Extraction Technologies
- **High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL):** Conventional for nickel-cobalt laterites and Ti-bearing feed. Laterite ores or TiO₂ slag are leached with hot concentrated H₂SO₄ or HCl under pressure.  Studies report ~80–90% Sc recovery under optimized conditions ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379205891_Extraction_of_scandium_from_halmahera_limonite_ore_by_high_pressure_acid_leaching_HPAL_in_sulfuric_acid_solution#:~:text=scandium%20were%2085,6)). The pregnant liquor contains Sc³⁺ plus base metals, requiring downstream separation.
- **Pyrometallurgical Processing:** Some projects (e.g. Elk Creek) smelt ore to produce ferroniobium and TiO₂-rich slag.  The scandium partitions into the slag.  As Bisaka et al. (2017) describe, carbothermic smelting can separate Fe (as metal) from rare-earth oxides (which go to slag) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?lng=pt&nrm=iso&pid=S2225-62532017000800004&script=sci_arttext&tlng=en#:~:text=Separation%20of%20iron%20and%20rare,step%20is%20the%20extraction%20of)).  The Sc-enriched slag is then leached hydrometallurgically to recover Sc oxide.
- **Solvent Leaching of Industrial Residues:** Scandium can be extracted from wastes like TiO₂ pigment slag or red mud.  For example, Rio Tinto’s Fer et Titane unit leaches TiO₂ production residues with acid to dissolve the contained Sc, without mining additional ore ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/can/news/releases/2021/Rio-Tinto-enters-scandium-market-with-construction-of-new-plant-in-Canada#:~:text=RTFT%20developed%20an%20innovative%20process,Pierre%2C%20Quebec)).  Such secondary sources circumvent the need for new mines.
- **Bioleaching:**  Certain acidophilic microbes (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus* spp.) can solubilize Sc from low-grade ore or tailings at ambient temperature.  Bioleaching is still developmental for Sc, but early studies show it can selectively extract Sc with lower chemical and energy input, albeit with slower kinetics ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=Compared%20to%20conventional%20leaching%20methods%2C,product%20generation%2C%20less%20energy)).

## Key Separation Technologies
- **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The industry-standard for Sc purification.  Organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA/P204, Cyanex 272, PC-88A) have been tested for Sc⁺ˣ separation.  For instance, saline-hydrochloric leach liquors treated with D2EHPA can extract >99% of Sc under proper conditions ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/7/2376/htm#:~:text=acidity%20range%20of%201%E2%80%9311%20mol%2FL,Following)), with minimal co-extraction of iron.  Stripping and re-precipitation then yield pure Sc salts.  Commercial SX circuits (mixer–settlers) can be applied once the leachate is pre-treated.
- **Ion-Exchange & Resin Scavenging:** Chelating resins (impregnated with phosphonic or aminophosphonic groups) can selectively capture Sc from acidic solutions.  In bench tests, specialized Purolite resins achieved over 99% Sc uptake from simulated leachates ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2297-8739/10/7/366#:~:text=The%20Netherlands,be%20saturated%20very%20quickly%20with)).  These solid-phase systems avoid organic solvents, allowing Sc adsorption directly from dilute streams and later elution.
- **Selective Precipitation:** Simple chemical precipitation can isolate Sc.  (a) Raising pH precipitates Sc(OH)₃ (often with other REE hydroxides).  (b) Fluoride addition precipitates Sc as K₃ScF₆ (a water-soluble fluoride complex).  (c) Addition of oxalate or phosphate can co-precipitate Sc–oxalate or Sc–phosphate.  These methods convert dissolved Sc to solid compounds for filtration.  (Fluoride precipitation is commonly used in industry to recover Sc from titanium plant streams.)
- **Solvent-Impregnated Polymers:** Advanced polymer beads pre-loaded with extractants (like D2EHPA) combine SX chemistry with solid supports. These SIPs can extract Sc with efficiencies similar to liquid SX while reducing solvent losses and simplifying phase handling.  Studies show impregnated resin beads can behave comparably to liquid SX for Sc, though this is still mostly at R&D stage.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
- **Metal Production (Sc Metal):** Refined Sc₂O₃ is converted to metal via metallothermic or electrolytic methods.  Typically, Sc₂O₃ is first converted to fluoride (ScF₃) or chloride (ScCl₃).  Then it is reduced by calcium or aluminum (aluminothermic reduction) under argon, yielding Sc metal and Ca/CaCl₂ or Al₂O₃ byproducts.  Alternatively, molten salt electrolysis (e.g. in LiF–CaF₂ or KCl–AlCl₃ melts) can produce Sc metal directly.  All these routes operate at high temperature and small scale due to Sc’s cost.
- **Al–Sc Master Alloy Production:**  The primary commercial product is aluminum–scandium master alloy (typically 2–10% Sc).  Purified Sc metal is charged with Al in a vacuum induction furnace.  The melt is cast or atomized to produce Al–Sc alloy ingots or powder (“Magalloy”).  This master alloy is later added to aluminum castings or wrought alloy melts to make aerospace-grade Al-Sc components.
- **Electrolytic Refining/Alloying:**  Some advanced concepts fuse refining with alloying.  For example, simultaneous electrolysis of a Sc salt with aluminum can deposit an Al–Sc ingot directly.  While not widely commercial yet, research (e.g. Harata 2008) demonstrates metallothermic and electrolytic methods to produce Al–Sc alloy directly from oxides ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233599770_Production_of_scandium_and_Al-Sc_alloy_by_metallothermic_reduction#:~:text=Article)).
- **Vacuum Arc/Zone Melting:**  To achieve ultra-high purity, produced Sc metal or Al–Sc alloy can be refined by vacuum arc remelting or zone melting.  These processes strip out trace impurities (Fe, Ti, Si, etc.) to meet aerospace specifications.  For niche applications, multiple re-melts and electron beam refining can yield 99.99%-pure Sc.

## Key Remediation Technologies
- **Bioleaching Remediation:**  As noted, acidophilic microbes can extract residual Sc from tailings or low-grade material.  Pilot tests of *Acidithiobacillus* and other cultures show they can mobilize Sc at ambient conditions, potentially lowering the acidity or chemical usage in tailings treatment ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/10/1/8#:~:text=Compared%20to%20conventional%20leaching%20methods%2C,product%20generation%2C%20less%20energy)).
- **Resin-in-Pulp (RIP):**  An emerging approach is to add extractant-loaded resin beads directly into leach/slurry tanks or tailings ponds.  The resin adsorbs Sc³⁺ from the liquid, effectively combining leaching and extraction.  After loading, the resin is separated and Sc is stripped.  This can eliminate solvent circulation and reduce organics usage, as demonstrated in analogous uranium or REE processes.
- **Biosorbents & Functional Sorbents:**  Low-cost sorbents (e.g. biochar, agricultural waste, clay minerals) can be functionalized with chelating groups to bind Sc from dilute waters.  Lab studies (e.g. using fungal biomass or modified cellulose) report >90% uptake of Sc from synthetic solutions.  Once saturated, the biosorbent is regenerated with acid to recover the Sc.  These methods aim to capture Sc without intensive chemicals.
- **Nanofiltration/Membranes:**  Novel membrane technologies are under investigation.  RSC Tech (2019) demonstrated that customized nanofiltration membranes could retain ~60–90% of Sc from titanium plant acid waste under low-pressure conditions ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2019/ew/c9ew00509a#:~:text=waste%20by%20nanofiltration%20was%20investigated,Sc%2C%20removing%20the%20major)).  Electrodialysis and other membrane processes can also concentrate Sc ions from spent leach solutions.  The main challenge is fouling by high salt/impurity levels, but membranes offer solvent-free concentration.
- **Acid Neutralization & Water Treatment:**  Conventional tailings treatment (addition of lime/limestone) is used to neutralize acidity and precipitate metals after Sc recovery.  Any Sc remaining in process water can be further scavenged by wetlands, biosorption columns or membrane filters.  Recycle of spent leaching acid (e.g. regenerating H₂SO₄) is also practiced to minimize waste.  Overall, industry follows best practices (lime addition, thickening, filter-cake disposal) tailored from base-metal and REE plants.
