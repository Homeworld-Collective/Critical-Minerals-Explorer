# US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** ~0.87 Mt of primary aluminium produced in 2022 ([www.nffs.org](https://www.nffs.org/news/january-2023-us-and-canada-primary-aluminum-production#:~:text=Based%20on%20Aluminum%20Association%20surveys%2C,8%20kmt)).  Key U.S. smelters (Century, Alcoa, Goldendale) together run under 1 Mt despite ~2.8 Mt installed capacity ([www.nffs.org](https://www.nffs.org/news/january-2023-us-and-canada-primary-aluminum-production#:~:text=Based%20on%20Aluminum%20Association%20surveys%2C,8%20kmt)) (many plants are idled or curtailed).  
• **Canada:** ~3.3 Mt in 2023 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/aluminum-facts/20510#:~:text=Key%20facts)).  Canada is a world leader (4th globally) with large hydro-powered smelters (Rio Tinto, Alouette, Aluminerie Alouette, Sept-Îles, Beauharnois, Alma etc.).  
• **Australia:** ~1.58 Mt in 2024 ([aluminium.org.au](https://aluminium.org.au/australian-industry/australian-aluminium/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20four%20aluminium,the%20world%E2%80%99s%20seventh%20largest%20producer)) (mostly exported).  Four coastal smelters (Tomago, Boyne Island, Bell Bay, Portland) produce ~1.5–1.6 Mt annually.  
• **Europe (EU27+UK):** Roughly 2–3 Mt. Major facilities include France (Dunkerque, St-Jean: ~430 kt ([askjaenergy.com](https://askjaenergy.com/2020/09/29/aluminum-smelters-of-the-world-outside-of-china/#:~:text=27%20%20,Valco))) and Germany (Neuss, Voerde, Hamburg, Essen: ~631 kt ([askjaenergy.com](https://askjaenergy.com/2020/09/29/aluminum-smelters-of-the-world-outside-of-china/#:~:text=27%20%20,Valco))), Spain (~430 kt), plus others. Actual output is on the order of a few million tons.  
• **Norway:** ~1.48 Mt capacity (Høyanger, Husnes, Karmøy, Årdal, Sunndal, Lista, Mosjøen) ([askjaenergy.com](https://askjaenergy.com/2020/09/29/aluminum-smelters-of-the-world-outside-of-china/#:~:text=63%20%20,Alcoa)) (hydro-powered Hydro/Alcoa lines).  
• **Iceland:** ~0.87 Mt capacity (Alcoa Reyðarfjörður 346 kt, Century Grundartangi 312 kt, Rio Tinto Straumsvik 210 kt) ([askjaenergy.com](https://askjaenergy.com/2020/09/29/aluminum-smelters-of-the-world-outside-of-china/#:~:text=37%20%20,Rio%20Tinto)). All are export-oriented “green” aluminium.  
• **Japan:** Domestic primary output is negligible; nearly all (~1.05 Mt in 2024 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2653056-japan-s-primary-aluminium-imports-rise-in-2024#:~:text=Market%3A%20Metals%20,from%20India%2C%20South%20Africa%20and))) is imported (from Australia, Middle East, etc.). 

# US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **North America (US+Canada):** Demand is projected to rise significantly.  CRU/International Aluminium Institute forecasts North American demand will need +5.1 Mt more aluminium by 2030 (vs 2020) ([international-aluminium.org](https://international-aluminium.org/report-reveals-global-aluminium-demand-to-reach-new-highs-after-covid/#:~:text=Two,account%20for%20more%20than%2090)) – on top of an estimated ~12.5 Mt/yr in 2022. Growth is driven by lightweight transportation (EVs, aircraft), renewable energy (cables, solar), construction and packaging.  
• **Europe (EU+UK+Norway/Iceland):** Demand up ~+4.8 Mt by 2030 ([international-aluminium.org](https://international-aluminium.org/report-reveals-global-aluminium-demand-to-reach-new-highs-after-covid/#:~:text=Two,account%20for%20more%20than%2090)).  Rising applications in green energy (grid upgrades, turbines), EVs, and construction (non-CFC insulations, facades) fuel this growth.  European demand (perhaps 6–8 Mt/yr today) is thus expected to reach mid-teens.  
• **Japan (and allied Asia):** Japan’s consumption is part of the “Rest of Asia” forecast.  Combined non-China Asian demand (including Japan) is seen adding ~+8.6 Mt by 2030 ([international-aluminium.org](https://international-aluminium.org/report-reveals-global-aluminium-demand-to-reach-new-highs-after-covid/#:~:text=Two,account%20for%20more%20than%2090)).  Japanese industries will consume more aluminium (current ~1.3 Mt/yr imported) for auto, electronics and infrastructure.  

# US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** Base production ~0.87 Mt (2022) ([www.nffs.org](https://www.nffs.org/news/january-2023-us-and-canada-primary-aluminum-production#:~:text=Based%20on%20Aluminum%20Association%20surveys%2C,8%20kmt)).  Planned expansion: Emirates Global Aluminium’s Oklahoma smelter (600 kt/yr) will nearly double U.S. primary output ([media.ega.ae](https://media.ega.ae/ega-progresses-plans-to-build-first-new-primary-aluminium-production-plant-in-the-us-since-1980-in-oklahoma/#:~:text=The%20plant%20is%20expected%20to,are%20currently%20met%20by%20imports)).  With that new capacity (online ~2030) and existing recycling (~3 Mt scrap/yr in the U.S.), domestic supply could approach ~4–5 Mt/yr.  This would reduce, but not eliminate, heavy current import reliance (85% of U.S. demand is now imported) ([media.ega.ae](https://media.ega.ae/ega-progresses-plans-to-build-first-new-primary-aluminium-production-plant-in-the-us-since-1980-in-oklahoma/#:~:text=The%20plant%20is%20expected%20to,from%20automotive%20to%20aviation%20and)).  
• **Canada:** Base ~3.3 Mt (2023) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/our-natural-resources/minerals-mining/minerals-metals-facts/aluminum-facts/20510#:~:text=Key%20facts)).  Rio Tinto is adding ~160 kt/yr at its low-carbon AP60 Saguenay smelter by 2026 ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2023/rio-tinto-to-expand-its-ap60-low-carbon-aluminium-smelter-in-quebec#:~:text=The%20investment%20will%20add%2096,of%20the%20industry%20cost%20curve)) (upgrading Jonquière while closing Arvida).  Canada’s capacity thus rises to ~3.46 Mt.  Additional scrap recycling (~3 Mt/yr) further bolsters supply.  
• **Australia:** Base ~1.58 Mt (2024) ([aluminium.org.au](https://aluminium.org.au/australian-industry/australian-aluminium/#:~:text=There%20are%20currently%20four%20aluminium,the%20world%E2%80%99s%20seventh%20largest%20producer)).  No major new smelters are announced (Yennora closed, others stable).  Electric smelting is shifting to renewables (Aus government $2B credit to green smelters ([cleanenergycouncil.org.au](https://cleanenergycouncil.org.au/news-resources/clean-energy-to-forge-a-strong-future-for-aluminium-made-in-australia#:~:text=Javascript%20must%20be%20enabled%20for,sector%20to%20switch%20to%20reliable))). Output ~1.6 Mt is expected unless power costs force cuts (Tomago has warned of 2029 shutdown risk with high grid prices ([www.afr.com](https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/rio-says-extremely-expensive-power-could-seal-tomago-fate-in-2029-20250220-p5ldoh#:~:text=Rio%20Tinto%20says%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20biggest,smelter%E2%80%99s%20future%20within%20six%20months))).  
• **Europe (incl Norway/Iceland):** Primary supply ~5–6 Mt (current).  Norway/Iceland ~2.35 Mt combined (1.48 Mt + 0.87 Mt) ([askjaenergy.com](https://askjaenergy.com/2020/09/29/aluminum-smelters-of-the-world-outside-of-china/#:~:text=63%20%20,Alcoa)) ([askjaenergy.com](https://askjaenergy.com/2020/09/29/aluminum-smelters-of-the-world-outside-of-china/#:~:text=37%20%20,Rio%20Tinto)); EU-27+UK ~2–3 Mt.  No new large smelters are under construction.  Instead, modernization (new cells, inert-anode pilots) aims to improve yields and carbon footprint.  Scrap recycling in Europe (~5–6 Mt/yr) constitutes a major local supply.  
• **Japan:** Domestic primary ~0, so 2030 supply mainly imports (currently ~1.05 Mt/yr ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2653056-japan-s-primary-aluminium-imports-rise-in-2024#:~:text=Market%3A%20Metals%20,from%20India%2C%20South%20Africa%20and))).  On the margin, Japan expands secondary recycling (old car/aluminium scrap).

# Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Hyperspectral Satellite/Aerial Imaging:** Multispectral (e.g. Landsat, ASTER) and hyperspectral sensors detect diagnostic minerals (gibbsite, goethite, kaolinite) that cap lateritic bauxite deposits.  Imaging of plateau-top cappings and alteration signatures guides exploration ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331009258_Remote_Sensing_Technology_for_Exploration_of_Mineral_Deposits_with_Special_Reference_to_Bauxite_and_Related_Minerals#:~:text=The%20inaccessibility%20of%20the%20terrain%2C,of%20digital%20image%20enhancements%20and)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331009258_Remote_Sensing_Technology_for_Exploration_of_Mineral_Deposits_with_Special_Reference_to_Bauxite_and_Related_Minerals#:~:text=geological%20and%20mineral%20exploration%20studies,for%20bauxite%20and%20related%20mineral)) (e.g. differentiating iron-rich bauxite caps by their spectral absorption).  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Field mapping identifies ancient weathering surfaces and residual soils where bauxite accumulates. Detailed rock and soil geochemistry (sampling of lateritic soils, clays and stream sediments) can flag aluminium enrichment or associated pathfinders (Ti, Fe, V).  Inaccessible terrain can be pre-screened by remote sensing, then ground-prospected for laterite profiles ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331009258_Remote_Sensing_Technology_for_Exploration_of_Mineral_Deposits_with_Special_Reference_to_Bauxite_and_Related_Minerals#:~:text=The%20inaccessibility%20of%20the%20terrain%2C,of%20digital%20image%20enhancements%20and)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331009258_Remote_Sensing_Technology_for_Exploration_of_Mineral_Deposits_with_Special_Reference_to_Bauxite_and_Related_Minerals#:~:text=geological%20and%20mineral%20exploration%20studies,for%20bauxite%20and%20related%20mineral)).  
• **Aerogeophysical Surveys:** Airborne magnetics and gravity (and sometimes EM) are used to infer buried laterite thickness (iron-rich bauxites are often mildly magnetic/gravimetric).  Regional data can outline flat erosional surfaces and basin structures conducive to lateritic weathering (e.g. Precambrian shields, plateaus).  
• **Downhole Geophysics & Assays:** Borehole logging (gamma, density) in pilot drillholes quantifies bauxite grade and continuity beneath surface cappings. Integrated GIS and ML on geospatial data (DEM, geology) help predict extensions of known deposits.  

# Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Bauxite Mining:** Strip-mining of laterite using power shovels/front-end loaders and haul trucks.  Ore is washed and crushed at mine-site mills: lime and recycled Bayer “spent liquor” (NaOH) are added to create a pumpable slurry ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=)). Heavy-duty excavators and conveyors handle the high-tonnage ore feed (often 20–40 % solids).  
• **Bayer Process (Alumina Extraction):** The slurry goes to autoclave digestion in hot concentrated NaOH. Alumina-bearing minerals (gibbsite Al(OH)₃, boehmite/diaspore AlO(OH)) dissolve into sodium aluminate ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=)).  Gibbsite-rich bauxites digest at ~140 °C, whereas boehmite and diaspore require 200–280 °C ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=Conditions%20within%20the%20digester%20,is%20not%20important%20for%20the)).  Silica-rich residues are first “desilicated” to avoid Na₂SiO₃ scale ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=)).  
• **Digestion & Clarification:** After digestion, the slurry is flashed and cooled. Spent bauxite residues (“red mud”) are separated in settling tanks with flocculant additives ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=)). Clarified sodium aluminate liquor moves on; solids are thickeners/disposed (often as dry-stack or pond tailings).  
• **Alumina Precipitation & Calcination:** The hot sodium aluminate (“pregnant liquor”) is seeded/cooled to precipitate Al hydroxide.  Precipitation (reverse of digestion) forms gibbsite crystals ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=In%20this%20stage%2C%20the%20alumina,is%20supersaturated%20in%20sodium%20aluminate)).  Cyclones/thickeners classify crystals by size; coarse gibbsite is washed and calcined (~1000°C) to give pure Al₂O₃ ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=form%20larger%20crystals,reaction%20in%20the%20digestion%20stage)).  Fine crystals are recycled to precipitation ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=The%20gibbsite%20crystals%20formed%20in,crystals%20are%20destined%20for%20calcination)).  
• **Electrolytic Reduction (Hall–Héroult):** Alumina is dissolved in a molten cryolite bath (~950°C) and electrolyzed with large carbon anodes.  Each cell yields aluminium metal (Al³⁺ + 3e⁻ → Al) and O₂ (which reacts with C anode to CO₂) ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=Alumina%20is%20used%20for%20the,the%20Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult%20electrochemical%20smelting%20process)).  Most Allied smelters use prebaked carbon anodes.  New low-energy anode designs (e.g. advanced bipolar cells, inert anode trials) are under development but not yet commercial.  

# Key Separation Technologies  
• **Residue Separation:**  Solid-liquid separation of Bayer residue (red mud) is done in large settlers/thickeners.  Sludge is washed and the alkaline liquor is recovered; remaining solids are often filter-pressed.  This cleans NaOH out of the mud ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=In%20this%20stage%2C%20the%20alumina,is%20supersaturated%20in%20sodium%20aluminate)).  
• **Alumina Separation:**  In precipitation, Al(OH)₄⁻ ions convert to solid Al(OH)₃ via seeding ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=In%20this%20stage%2C%20the%20alumina,is%20supersaturated%20in%20sodium%20aluminate)).  Thickening/classification separates coarser Al(OH)₃ (to calciner) from mother liquor (recirculated).  Automated cyclone or gravity classifiers segregate crystal sizes ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=The%20gibbsite%20crystals%20formed%20in,crystals%20are%20destined%20for%20calcination)).  
• **Refined Metal Purification:**  After electrolysis, molten aluminium (99.5% Al) is tapped from the cell; fluxing additions (liquid NaCl–KCl) and gas sparging (Cl₂) remove dissolved Na/K and Mg.  Dross (Al oxides/spinels) is skimmed off the melt and recycled.  The crude Al is then cast (often DC casting) into ingots.  
• **Scrap Separation (Secondary Feed):**  In recycling, sorted scrap is critical.  Eddy-current separators fling non-ferrous (Al) fragments from shredded mixtures ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-021-04802-y#:~:text=Eddy%20current%20separation%20,ferrous)).  Spectroscopic sorting (X-ray or LIBS-based) identifies alloy grade for segregating high-grade scrap ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-021-04802-y#:~:text=The%20spectrographic%20technique%20is%20widely,be%20identified%20by%20using%20these)).  Chemical refinement (flux-slagging) then separates dross from molten scrap.  

# Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Hall–Héroult Smelting:** The industry-standard electrolytic reduction remains central.  Cells operate at 950–980 °C in cryolite, using prebaked carbon anodes ([bauxite.world-aluminium.org](https://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/index.php?L=0&id=208#:~:text=Alumina%20is%20used%20for%20the,the%20Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult%20electrochemical%20smelting%20process)).  Modern cells (Rio’s Alouette AP60, EGA’s smelter design) push µGWh funding and digital controls to edge efficiency.  Research on inert ceramic anodes (e.g. NiFe₂O₄ cermets) targets carbon-free operation, but full-scale use is still years away.  
• **Ingot Casting & Alloying:** Molten primary aluminium is cast in DC/Ingots (50–250 kg) or continuously cast rods. Alloying elements (Mg, Si, Cu, Ti, Zn) are added to produce 2xxx–8xxx series alloys. Secondary refining (degassing by rotary impeller with inert gas, fluxing with Cl₂) assures final melt quality.  Continuous melt filtration removes oxide inclusions before casting.  
• **Secondary Melting:** Recycled aluminium is melted in reverberatory or induction furnaces.  Salt pre-treatment and fluxes capture alkali (Na, K) and oxides.  Secondary smelting uses ~10× less energy than primary (e.g. ~5–15 kWh/kg vs 14–16 kWh/kg).  Processes like vacuum degassing, trace element extraction (via salt slag treatment), and direct-chill casting ensure high-purity recycled metal.  
• **Electrorefining (experimental):** High-purity (≥99.99%) aluminium can be produced by electrorefining scrap in molten salts (e.g. Hall–Héroult-like cells with aluminum anodes in cryolitic baths). Although energy-intensive, “Hoopes cells” are used for specialty purifications (e.g. making Al–Mg products) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11837-021-04802-y#:~:text=Hoopes%20Process)).  

# Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Red Mud (Bauxite Residue) Neutralization:** Ca/Mg-rich additives (seawater, lime) are used to neutralize alkaline red mud.  Adding seawater precipitates hydroxides/carbonates and lowers pH; treated liquor (pH<9.0) can be safely discharged ([www.azom.com](https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2071#:~:text=When%20seawater%20or%20other%20Ca,discharged%20to%20the%20marine%20environment)).  Resulting solids (hydrotalcite-like minerals) can be reused (e.g. as acid mine-drainage treatment media).  Research on “bauxsol” or geopolymers aims to convert neutralized mud into construction materials.  
• **Dry Stacking & Backfilling:** Instead of open ponds, modern plants filter-press red mud to a damp cake for stacking.  Dry stacks prevent seepage and enable progressive mine reclamation.  Some operations mix residue with sand/cement to build road base or return fill for excavations.  
• **Spent Potliner Treatment:** Carbon-electrolyte liners contain toxic F⁻/CN⁻.  Current practice is cryogenic fracture or rotary kiln breaking, recovering NaF salts and carbon for reuse.  Emerging methods include pyrolysis to capture HF and Al metal carbide.  Safe landfilling (after detoxification with lime) is interim.  
• **Flue Gas & Dust Capture:** Smelter emissions (fluoride dusts, particulates) are collected by baghouses and precipitators.  Fluoride-laden dust is then processed to recover Na/Al values or immobilized (e.g. as calcium fluosilicate).  CO₂ scrubbers or capture systems are largely experimental (as carbon comes from anode) – true decarbonization awaits inert anodes.

# Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Carbon Anode Smelting / Energy:**  The reliance on Hall–Héroult cells with carbon anodes is the critical bottleneck.  No industrial-scale inert-anode alternative is yet proven, so allied smelters must burn coke (emitting CO₂).  This limits expansion under climate goals.  Coupled with the need for very cheap, continuous power, smelting capacity growth is constrained (e.g. Rio’s Tomago viability is threatened by power costs ([www.afr.com](https://www.afr.com/companies/mining/rio-says-extremely-expensive-power-could-seal-tomago-fate-in-2029-20250220-p5ldoh#:~:text=Rio%20Tinto%20says%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20biggest,smelter%E2%80%99s%20future%20within%20six%20months))).  
• **Bauxite/Alumina Supply:**  Another bottleneck is ore sourcing.  The US has virtually no domestic bauxite or alumina refining, so even new smelters (like EGA’s 600kt plant) must rely on imported alumina ([media.ega.ae](https://media.ega.ae/ega-progresses-plans-to-build-first-new-primary-aluminium-production-plant-in-the-us-since-1980-in-oklahoma/#:~:text=The%20plant%20is%20expected%20to,from%20automotive%20to%20aviation%20and)).  Creating homegrown alumina production (or new extraction tech) is essential to scaling allied supply.  

# Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Domestic primary aluminum output in the US and allied countries is fundamentally limited by feedstock and energy constraints.  For example, even with planned expansions, the U.S. must import ~85% of its aluminium demand ([media.ega.ae](https://media.ega.ae/ega-progresses-plans-to-build-first-new-primary-aluminium-production-plant-in-the-us-since-1980-in-oklahoma/#:~:text=The%20plant%20is%20expected%20to,from%20automotive%20to%20aviation%20and)) because it lacks bauxite and alumina refining.  The century-old Hall–Héroult smelting with carbon anodes (and its enormous electricity draw) remains a bottleneck; without breakthroughs (inert anodes or alternative reduction methods), production cannot be scaled without massive emissions.  In short, securing low-cost renewable power and developing new smelting technology are critical shortfalls in the allied aluminium supply chain ([media.ega.ae](https://media.ega.ae/ega-progresses-plans-to-build-first-new-primary-aluminium-production-plant-in-the-us-since-1980-in-oklahoma/#:~:text=The%20plant%20is%20expected%20to,are%20currently%20met%20by%20imports)).
