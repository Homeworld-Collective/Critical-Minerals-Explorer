# Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Carbon anode dependency; alumina import reliance; energy infrastructure constraints*

The primary bottleneck constraining US and allied aluminum production is the continued reliance on carbon-intensive Hall-Héroult smelting technology requiring 13-15 kWh/kg of electricity. Despite progress by ELYSIS (Rio Tinto/Alcoa joint venture) on inert anode technology, no commercial-scale carbon-free alternative exists. The US lacks domestic bauxite mining and alumina refining capacity, forcing even new smelters to depend entirely on imported feedstock. This dual constraint of energy-intensive legacy technology and absent upstream processing capability limits expansion potential. Without breakthrough technologies in low-energy reduction processes or massive investments in renewable power infrastructure coupled with domestic alumina production, allied nations cannot significantly scale aluminum output to meet projected 2030 demand growth.

# US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~10.5 Mt/year combined primary production*

• **United States:** ~0.86 Mt of primary aluminum produced in 2022 (USGS). Key U.S. smelters (Century Aluminum, Alcoa, Magnitude 7) operate well below ~2.8 Mt installed capacity due to high electricity costs and aging infrastructure. Multiple facilities remain curtailed or on care-and-maintenance status.

• **Canada:** ~3.0 Mt in 2023 (Natural Resources Canada). Canada ranks 4th globally with competitive hydro-powered smelters operated by Rio Tinto (10 smelters in Quebec/BC), Alcoa (3 smelters), and Alouette (Sept-Îles). Quebec alone accounts for ~90% of Canadian production.

• **Australia:** ~1.5 Mt in 2023 (Australian Aluminium Council). Four coastal smelters: Tomago (NSW, 590 kt), Boyne Island (QLD, 560 kt), Portland (VIC, 350 kt), and Bell Bay (TAS, 190 kt). All face electricity cost pressures threatening long-term viability.

• **Europe (EU27+UK):** ~3.5 Mt combined. Major producers include Norway (~1.4 Mt), Iceland (~0.85 Mt), Germany (~0.5 Mt), France (~0.4 Mt), Spain (~0.35 Mt), and Netherlands (~0.3 Mt). Many EU smelters operate at reduced capacity due to energy costs.

• **Japan:** Domestic primary production ceased in 2014. Japan imports ~1.0 Mt annually (2023 data) primarily from Australia, UAE, Russia, and India. Maintains significant secondary aluminum production from recycling.

# US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ~45-50 Mt/year projected combined demand*

• **North America (US+Canada):** Current demand ~7 Mt/year expected to reach ~12-13 Mt by 2030. International Aluminium Institute/CRU forecasts 5-6 Mt growth driven by electric vehicles (3x aluminum content vs ICE vehicles), renewable energy infrastructure, and aerospace recovery. Lightweighting mandates and grid modernization accelerate consumption.

• **Europe (EU+UK+Norway/Iceland):** Current consumption ~7-8 Mt/year projected to reach ~12-13 Mt by 2030. Growth drivers include EV production targets (10+ million vehicles/year by 2030), wind turbine manufacturing, building renovation wave (insulation/facades), and circular economy initiatives requiring aluminum packaging.

• **Japan and Allied Asia:** Japan consumes ~2 Mt/year with modest growth expected. South Korea (~1.5 Mt) and other allied Asian nations project 20-30% demand increases by 2030. Combined allied Asian demand could reach ~5-6 Mt driven by electronics, automotive, and construction sectors.

# US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ~12-14 Mt/year projected primary production*

• **United States:** Base production ~0.86 Mt unlikely to exceed 1.5 Mt by 2030. Proposed Emirates Global Aluminium smelter in Oklahoma (capacity unconfirmed, likely 200-400 kt) would be first new US smelter since 1980. Restart potential exists for curtailed capacity if electricity costs decline. Secondary production from recycling (~3.5 Mt) provides crucial supply.

• **Canada:** Current ~3.0 Mt expanding modestly. Rio Tinto's AP60 technology deployment adds 96 kt at Saguenay complex by 2026. Kitimat modernization complete (420 kt capacity). Further growth constrained by hydro availability. Strong recycling sector adds ~1 Mt secondary aluminum.

• **Australia:** Production likely stable at ~1.5 Mt if smelters secure renewable power agreements. Tomago (largest smelter) requires new electricity contract by 2028 or faces closure. Government's $2 billion green aluminum support package aims to preserve capacity through renewable transition.

• **Europe:** Primary production ~5.5 Mt expected to remain flat or decline slightly. Norway/Iceland maintain output with renewable power advantage. EU smelters face continued pressure from carbon pricing and electricity costs. Recycling provides ~6-7 Mt secondary supply, critical for meeting demand.

• **Japan:** Will remain 100% import-dependent for primary aluminum. Focus on maximizing secondary production through advanced sorting and recycling technologies. Urban mining initiatives target end-of-life vehicles and construction waste.

# Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
The US and allied aluminum supply chain faces critical constraints from absent domestic alumina refining capacity and aging, carbon-intensive smelting infrastructure requiring massive electricity inputs. Even with all planned expansions, the US will import >80% of aluminum demand through 2030 due to lack of bauxite resources and only one potential new smelter. The technological bottleneck remains the century-old Hall-Héroult process; despite progress on inert anodes by ELYSIS, no commercial carbon-free alternative exists, limiting production growth under climate commitments. Securing competitive renewable electricity and developing revolutionary low-energy reduction technology are essential for allied supply chain resilience.
