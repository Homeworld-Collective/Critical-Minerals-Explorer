## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Heavy-REE separation and refining infrastructure*

The chief bottleneck is **heavy-REE separation and refining**. Currently ~90% of global dysprosium/terbium separation capacity resides in China. Western allies can mine RE oxides, but turning those concentrates into isolated Dy₂O₃ or Dy metal is costly and technologically challenging. For example, the Mountain Pass Stage II (HREE separation) plant under construction is the first US facility of its kind. Until such plants come online and prove economical at scale, allied producers will struggle to convert minor heavy-REE fractions into usable dysprosium products. In short, the lack of midstream hydrometallurgical plants (solvent-extraction lines, molten-salt electrolysis, etc.) devoted to heavy RE elements is the critical bottleneck in building a domestic Dy supply chain.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: <100 tons Dy₂O₃/year combined*

- **USA (Mountain Pass)** – The only active US rare-earth mine is MP Materials' Mountain Pass (California). In 2024 it produced ~43,000 tonnes of rare-earth oxides (REO) concentrate. Mountain Pass ore is rich in light RE (La ~33%, Ce ~50% of REO), with minimal heavy-REE content; heavy RE including Dy comprise less than 0.5% of the REO. Thus US-derived dysprosium output is currently negligible (less than 50 tonnes of Dy₂O₃ per year implicit in REO concentrate). MP is expanding to separate Dy but has not yet published standalone Dy production volumes.

- **Australia (Lynas)** – Australia's Lynas Rare Earths (Mt Weld mine in Western Australia, processing in Malaysia) is the largest non-Chinese source. In FY2024 Lynas produced 10,908 tonnes of total rare-earth oxide (REO). Mt Weld ore contains monazite and xenotime minerals with higher heavy-REE content than Mountain Pass. Lynas achieved first commercial heavy-rare-earth production (Dy/Tb separations) at its Malaysia plant in 2024. Australia's current Dy output is estimated at 20-50 tonnes Dy₂O₃ annually from Lynas' operations.

- **Canada** – No commercial Dy mining/production exists today. The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) is piloting a processing facility using monazite feed and, with Canadian government funding, aims to produce ~20 tonnes/year of Dy₂O₃ (plus ~5 tonnes/year Tb₂O₃). This rare earth processing facility at demonstration scale would represent North America's first significant domestic Dy output if realized. Otherwise Canada's current Dy production is zero.

- **European Union / Norway / Iceland** – No active rare-earth mines or Dy production operate in Europe or other NATO allies apart from small pilot projects. Proposed projects have been delayed; only minor REE processing exists with virtually no heavy-REE (Dy) capacity. Thus domestic EU/Norway/Iceland Dy supply is currently zero.

- **Japan** – Japan has no domestic mining of rare earths. It relies entirely on imports (primarily from China). Japan does have advanced permanent magnet manufacturing and has started end-of-life magnet recycling, but obtains all Dy raw material from abroad. Current Japanese Dy production is zero.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 500-1,000 tons Dy₂O₃/year*

- **Electric Vehicle Traction Motors:** EVs use Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets that typically contain 2-6% dysprosium by weight to boost high-temperature performance. IEA projections show US/EU/Japan targeting combined EV production of 15-20 million vehicles annually by 2030. For reference, SRC notes that 20 tonnes/year Dy₂O₃ would supply magnets for ~500,000 EV motors. If allies reach 15 million EVs/year by 2030, Dy demand just for EV magnets could reach 400-600 tonnes/year Dy₂O₃ (assuming 1-2 kg Dy per vehicle).

- **Wind-Turbine Generators:** Offshore and onshore wind turbines increasingly use Nd-Fe-B permanent-magnet generators with dysprosium additions (typically 2-3% of magnet weight). A large turbine (5-10 MW) contains 2-5 kg of Dy. Global Wind Energy Council projects significant capacity additions through 2030. Combined US/EU wind expansion could add 100-200 tonnes Dy₂O₃ demand annually.

- **Other Uses:** Dysprosium is used in specialty alloys for aerospace applications, nuclear control rods (neutron absorption), magnetostrictive materials (Terfenol-D), and lasers. Growth in robotics, drones, and defense systems adds to magnet-related demand. These applications combined represent 50-100 tonnes annually. Overall, permanent-magnet applications dominate, with global magnet-REE demand forecast to increase substantially by 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 200-400 tons Dy₂O₃/year*

- **USA:** MP Materials is building a Stage II separator for heavy RE including Dy, targeting operations by 2026. When operational, it will allow Mountain Pass to produce separated Dy₂O₃. USA Rare Earth's Round Top project in Texas, if financed, could produce HREE-rich concentrate as Round Top ore contains elevated yttrium and heavy REEs. Overall, US Dy output by 2030 might reach 100-200 tonnes Dy₂O₃/year including MP's output plus potential new projects.

- **Canada:** If SRC's funded plant is completed with monazite feed, it would add up to 20 tonnes/year Dy₂O₃ by the mid-2020s. Additional projects like Vital Metals' Nechalacho could add capacity if developed. Canadian production by 2030: 20-50 tonnes Dy₂O₃/year.

- **Australia:** Lynas is expanding heavy REE production capabilities. With its Malaysian HREE circuit operational and Mt Weld expansion plans, Australia could potentially supply 50-100 tonnes/year Dy₂O₃ by 2030. Northern Minerals' Browns Range project, if restarted, could add xenotime-derived heavy REEs.

- **EU/Norway/Iceland:** Projected domestic supply remains near zero for 2030. The EU will rely on imports; no operational HREE mine or plant exists. Planned projects face continued delays. The EU may recover 10-20 tonnes/year Dy₂O₃ from magnet recycling by 2030.

- **Japan:** No new domestic sources planned. Japan will continue importing all Dy raw material. Magnet recycling initiatives may contribute 10-30 tonnes by 2030. Japan's primary supply will depend on imports from allied and Chinese sources.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Airborne geophysics; geochemical sampling; hyperspectral imaging; systematic drilling*

• **Airborne Radiometric and Magnetic Surveys:** Many REE deposits contain uranium/thorium and ferromagnetic minerals. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry highlights radiometric anomalies associated with monazite and xenotime. Airborne magnetics and gravity surveys detect buried carbonatite or alkaline intrusions. Mountain Pass (California) and Mt Weld (Australia) were identified through geophysical anomalies.

• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Systematic mapping of REE-bearing rock types (carbonatites, alkaline complexes, heavy-mineral sands) focuses exploration. Stream sediment and soil sampling for REE and pathfinder elements (Nb, Zr, Y) identifies anomalies. Elevated yttrium often indicates heavy-REE enrichment.

• **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:** Visible/infrared remote sensing detects alteration minerals associated with REE deposits. Satellite and drone-mounted hyperspectral cameras survey large areas for REE-bearing mineral signatures, particularly useful in remote locations.

• **Drill Testing and Geochemical Profiling:** Systematic drilling with multi-element ICP-MS analysis quantifies Dy concentrations. Mineralogical studies using QEMSCAN or automated mineralogy identify Dy-bearing phases (xenotime, fergusonite). Down-hole geophysics helps define ore geometry.

• **Ion-Adsorbed Clay Assessment:** While primarily relevant to China/Southeast Asia, any weathered granite terrains in allied nations are assessed using ammonium sulfate leach tests to identify ion-exchangeable REEs. This remains exploratory in Western contexts.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Open-pit mining; flotation concentration; gravity/magnetic separation; acid leaching; dry-stack tailings*

• **Open-Pit Mining & Milling:** Large-scale open-pit methods extract REE ores using conventional drill-blast-load-haul cycles. Mountain Pass and Mt Weld operate open pits feeding crushing and grinding circuits. Ore is reduced to <75 μm for liberation of REE minerals.

• **Flotation Concentration:** Froth flotation separates REE minerals from gangue. Mountain Pass uses flotation to produce 60% REO bastnäsite concentrate. Collectors (fatty acids, hydroxamates) and depressants (sodium silicate) achieve separation. Mt Weld employs similar flotation for concentrate production.

• **Gravity & Magnetic Separation:** Heavy-mineral sand deposits use spirals, shaking tables, and high-intensity magnetic separators to concentrate monazite and xenotime. These methods pre-concentrate REE minerals based on density and magnetic susceptibility differences.

• **Acid Baking/Leaching:** Concentrated REE minerals undergo chemical breakdown. Sulfuric acid baking at 200-300°C converts REE minerals to sulfates, followed by water leaching. Alternative alkaline cracking using sodium hydroxide at 140-180°C dissolves REE phosphates. Both routes produce REE-rich leach solutions.

• **Dry Stack Tailings & Water Recycling:** Mountain Pass pioneered dry-stack tailings using filter presses to produce stackable filter cake with 15-20% moisture. This eliminates tailings ponds and enables >90% water recycling. Modern facilities target zero liquid discharge through complete water recycling.

• **In-Situ Recovery (Experimental):** Research explores in-situ leaching of ion-adsorbed clays using dilute ammonium sulfate solutions. While commercial in China, this remains experimental for potential Western clay-hosted deposits.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion exchange; chromatography; crystallization; emerging ionic liquids*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Industry standard using organic extractants (D2EHPA, PC88A, Cyanex 272) in mixer-settler cascades. Sequential pH adjustment separates individual REEs. Heavy/light REE separation occurs first, followed by individual element separation. Achieving Dy/Tb separation requires hundreds of stages due to similar chemistry.

• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatography:** Resin-based separation exploits small differences in REE-ligand stability constants. Continuous chromatographic separation using simulated moving bed technology shows promise. Companies like REEtec and ReElement develop continuous ion-exchange processes for cleaner separation with less organic waste.

• **Crystallization/Precipitation:** Fractional crystallization of REE double sulfates or nitrates provides separation. Selective precipitation using oxalates, carbonates, or hydroxides at controlled pH achieves group separations. These methods complement SX for purification.

• **Ionic Liquid Extraction:** Task-specific ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents offer environmentally friendly alternatives to traditional organics. Laboratory demonstrations show promising Dy/Nd separation factors. Commercial scale-up remains under development.

• **Membrane Separation:** Emerging technology using functionalized membranes for REE separation. Supported liquid membranes and polymer inclusion membranes show potential for continuous operation with reduced solvent use.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Molten salt electrolysis; metallothermic reduction; vacuum distillation; zone refining; magnet alloying*

• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Dy₂O₃ converts to metal via electrolysis in molten fluoride salts (LiF-DyF₃) at 850-1050°C. Dysprosium plates at the cathode while oxygen evolves at the anode. MP Materials' Fort Worth facility uses this technology to produce 99.9% pure Dy metal.

• **Metallothermic Reduction:** Calcium or lithium metal reduces DyF₃ or Dy₂O₃ at 1200-1400°C under argon atmosphere. The reaction produces Dy metal and calcium/lithium oxide slag. Vacuum distillation at 1200°C removes residual calcium, yielding 99.5%+ pure Dy.

• **Vacuum Distillation/Sublimation:** Further purification exploits vapor pressure differences. Vacuum sublimation at 1300-1500°C removes volatile impurities. Multiple distillation passes achieve 99.99% purity required for specialty applications.

• **Zone Refining:** Solid-state purification using traveling molten zones removes impurities through segregation. Electron-beam or induction heating creates the molten zone. This produces ultra-high purity (99.999%) Dy for research applications.

• **Alloying & Powder Metallurgy:** Dy typically alloys with Nd-Fe-B via grain boundary diffusion or co-melting. Strip casting and hydrogen decrepitation produce magnetic powders. Dy additions (2-6 wt%) enhance coercivity without significantly reducing magnetization.

• **Recycling Technologies:** Hydrometallurgical recycling dissolves end-of-life magnets in acids, followed by SX recovery. Direct electrochemical recycling and hydrogen processing of magnet scrap show promise for maintaining Dy in usable form.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Dry-stack tailings; water recycling; neutralization; reagent recovery; engineered barriers*

• **Dry-Stacked Tailings:** Filter presses dewater tailings to 15-20% moisture, creating stackable solid waste. This eliminates pond failures and reduces footprint by 50%. Covers prevent wind erosion and water infiltration.

• **Water and Chemical Recycling:** Closed-loop systems recycle >95% of process water through clarification, filtration, and reverse osmosis. Chemical recovery via distillation, precipitation, and regeneration minimizes reagent consumption. SRC's facility targets 100% water recycling.

• **Neutralization and Precipitation:** Lime or limestone neutralizes acidic effluents to pH 7-9, precipitating metals and radionuclides as hydroxides. Barium chloride precipitates radium as BaRaSO₄. Solid-liquid separation via clarifiers and filters produces clean water.

• **Reagent Recovery:** Spent organic solvents undergo regeneration through washing, distillation, and clay treatment. Acid recovery using diffusion dialysis or distillation reduces fresh acid requirements by 70-90%.

• **Radioactivity Management:** Thorium and uranium in REE ores require special handling. Precipitation as hydroxides or phosphates immobilizes radionuclides. Storage in engineered vaults with monitoring ensures long-term stability.

• **Engineered Barriers:** Multi-layer covers using clay, geomembranes, and vegetation prevent water infiltration and radon emission. Drainage layers and monitoring wells detect any seepage. Regular inspections ensure long-term integrity.

## Key Bottleneck Summary
Allied mining capacity can deliver mixed rare-earth concentrates, but **separating and refining Dy** remains the critical weakness. Heavy-REE separation processes (solvent extraction trains, electrolytic metal production) are complex and currently concentrated in China, which controls ~90% of global capacity. Even with ore resources available, US/allies lack comparable HREE processing infrastructure. Without major investment in Dy-specific separation/refinement facilities or breakthrough recycling technologies, domestic supply will remain severely constrained relative to projected 2030 demand.
