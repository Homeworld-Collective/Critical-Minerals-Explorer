## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Heavy-REE separation and refining infrastructure*  
Heavy-REE separation (Dy, Tb) and refining remains the critical bottleneck. China holds a near-monopoly on these processes ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=The%20U,heat%20permanent%20magnets.%20China%27s)): Time magazine notes that China now controls ≈96% of the market for dysprosium/terbium (heavy-REE) elements ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=The%20U,heat%20permanent%20magnets.%20China%27s)).  In practice, Western producers can mine REE concentrates, but lack midstream hydrometallurgical capacity to extract HREEs.  For example, MP Materials’ Stage-II expansion at Mountain Pass (due ~2026) is intended to enable domestic Dy/Tb separation, but it is currently the only such facility under development outside China ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=The%20U,heat%20permanent%20magnets.%20China%27s)).  Until these plants (with multistage solvent-extraction circuits and molten-salt electrowinning) come online at scale, allied producers must export heavy fractions for processing.  In short, the absence of commercial midstream HREE refining (solvent extraction trains, electrolytic metal production, etc.) in the US/allies is the key constraint ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=The%20U,heat%20permanent%20magnets.%20China%27s)) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: <100 tons Dy₂O₃/year combined*  

- **USA (Mountain Pass)** – MP Materials’ Mountain Pass mine (CA) is the only current US rare-earth operation.  In 2024 it produced a record 45,000 metric tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) concentrate ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  This bastnäsite-(Ce) concentrate contains mostly light-REE (La/Ce-rich), with bastnäsite oxide grades ≈62% TREO ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/product/bastnaesite-concentrate#:~:text=Bastnaesite%20concentrate%20serves%20as%20a,edge%20industries)).  Heavy-REE content is extremely low – bastnäsite is dominated by La/Ce, while Dy/Tb reside only in accessory minerals at ppm levels ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/complex-carbonate-ore-mineralogy-mountain-pass-carbonatite-rare-earth-element-deposit#:~:text=structurally%20abundant%20in%20bastn%C3%A4site%2C%20whereas,ore%20processing%20and%20magnet%20manufacture)).  Thus US-derived Dy₂O₃ output today is effectively negligible.  MP’s Stage-II plant (under construction) will allow on-site separation of NdPr and heavier elements, but no standalone Dy production has yet been reported ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  All US Dy currently ends up as unrecovered minor constituents in MP’s concentrate.  

- **Australia (Lynas)** – Lynas Rare Earths (Mt Weld mine, Australia; processing in Malaysia) is the largest non-Chinese REE supplier. In FY2024 Lynas mined/processed 10,908 t total REO ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=During%20the%20year%20production%20decisions,the%20capacity%20expansion%20were%20completed)).  Mt Weld ore contains bastnäsite plus monazite/xenotime, giving higher MREE/HREE than Mountain Pass.  Lynas has reconfigured its Malaysian refinery to begin separating Dy and Tb for the first time ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=production%20of%20two%20Heavy%20Rare,in%20Malaysia%20in%20CY2025)) ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=,Malaysia%20for%20the%20first%20time)).  First commercial production of separated Dy₂O₃/Tb₄O₇ is expected by ~2025 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=production%20of%20two%20Heavy%20Rare,in%20Malaysia%20in%20CY2025)) ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=,Malaysia%20for%20the%20first%20time)).  Prior to that, Lynas’ Dy output was minimal – on the order of a few tens of tonnes per year (from monazite coproducts).  Once the Heavy RE circuit (1,500 tpa capacity) is ramped, Lynas could supply on the order of 20–50 t Dy₂O₃ annually ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=production%20of%20two%20Heavy%20Rare,in%20Malaysia%20in%20CY2025)) ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=,Malaysia%20for%20the%20first%20time)).  

- **Canada** – No commercial Dy production currently exists.  A pilot facility by Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) is under construction (monazite processing and solvent-extraction) with government support.  It is intended to produce separated RE oxides (primarily NdPr) by mid-2020s.  If realized, SRC’s plant could yield on the order of tens of tonnes of Dy₂O₃ per year (from monazite feed), but to date output is zero.  Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (NWT) and other proposals (e.g. Bear Lodge, WY in US) contain heavy-REE but are not yet producing.  

- **European Union / Norway / Iceland** – There are currently **no** operating rare-earth mines or HREE separation plants in the EU, Norway, or Iceland.  Planned projects (e.g. Tasmanian eudialyte, Swedish Norra Kärr) have faced delays or feasibility issues.  Thus domestic Dy₂O₃ supply in Western Europe is essentially zero today.  The EU is looking to magnet-recycling as a partial solution: new recycling projects (e.g. Carester, Heraeus Remloy) aim to recover REEs from end-of-life magnets, and the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act sets a 25% recycling target by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/recycling-kick-long-term-solution-eu-rare-earths-challenge-2024-06-27/#:~:text=EU%20companies%20are%20focusing%20on,portion%20of%20its%20rare%20earths)).  In practice, recycling may recover on the order of 10–20 t/yr Dy₂O₃ by 2030 from EU scrap.  

- **Japan** – Japan has no indigenous rare-earth mining or heavy-REE refining; it relies entirely on imports.  Japanese industry has stockpiled some critical REEs and is investing in magnet recycling (e.g. Dowa/Kosaka) and China-free motor designs ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=Efforts%20to%20diversify%20supply%20include,global%20rare%20earth%20prices%20driven)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/recycling-kick-long-term-solution-eu-rare-earths-challenge-2024-06-27/#:~:text=EU%20companies%20are%20focusing%20on,portion%20of%20its%20rare%20earths)), but present Dy₂O₃ production is zero.  Japan’s near-term supply will depend on allied imports and any recovered scrap (recycling could yield a few tens of tonnes of Dy₂O₃ by 2030).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 500–1,000 tons Dy₂O₃/year*  

- **Electric Vehicle Traction Motors:**  EVs use permanent-magnet (NdFeB) traction motors.  These magnets typically contain ~2–6 wt% dysprosium (to maintain coercivity at high temperature). Nearly all modern EV motors (>97%) use REE-based magnets ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/demand-destruction-can-help-break-chinas-rare-earths-chokehold-andy-home-2025-06-11/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20renewed%20restrictions%20on%20rare,and%20led%20to%20temporary%20diversification)).  The IEA projects combined US+EU+Japanese EV sales on the order of 15–20 million units/year by 2030.  Assuming roughly 1–2 kg Dy metal (≈1.5–3 kg Dy₂O₃) per vehicle, 15 million EVs/year would require roughly 400–600 t Dy₂O₃/year.  (As a rough check, SRC notes that ~20 t/yr Dy₂O₃ would supply magnets for ~500,000 EVs.)  Thus EV magnet demand alone could reach several hundred tonnes of Dy₂O₃ annually by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/demand-destruction-can-help-break-chinas-rare-earths-chokehold-andy-home-2025-06-11/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20renewed%20restrictions%20on%20rare,and%20led%20to%20temporary%20diversification)).  

- **Wind-Turbine Generators:**  Many new wind turbines (especially offshore/regional multi-MW units) use NdFeB permanent magnets in their generators.  A single large turbine (5–10 MW) contains several kilograms of Dy in its magnets.  With aggressive wind expansion in the US and EU, this sector could add on the order of 100–200 t/yr Dy₂O₃ demand by 2030.  (Orders of magnitude smaller than EVs, but still material in total.)  For context, recent plans (e.g. EU diversification strategies) emphasize securing Dy and Nd for wind MAG applications ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/recycling-kick-long-term-solution-eu-rare-earths-challenge-2024-06-27/#:~:text=EU%20companies%20are%20focusing%20on,portion%20of%20its%20rare%20earths)).  

- **Other Uses:**  Dysprosium is also used in smaller quantities in specialty aerospace alloys (high-strength, high-criticality applications) and in neutron-absorbing control rods (nuclear reactors), as well as in magnetostrictive materials (e.g. Terfenol-D) and laser materials.  These niche markets collectively consume on the order of 50–100 t/yr Dy₂O₃.  However, the dominant drivers of Dysprosium demand are permanent-magnet applications (EVs and wind).  In total, global Dy demand is forecasted to grow significantly by 2030, driven largely by green-energy and defense technologies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/demand-destruction-can-help-break-chinas-rare-earths-chokehold-andy-home-2025-06-11/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20renewed%20restrictions%20on%20rare,and%20led%20to%20temporary%20diversification)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/complex-carbonate-ore-mineralogy-mountain-pass-carbonatite-rare-earth-element-deposit#:~:text=structurally%20abundant%20in%20bastn%C3%A4site%2C%20whereas,ore%20processing%20and%20magnet%20manufacture)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 200–400 tons Dy₂O₃/year*  

- **USA:**  If MP Materials completes Stage II by ~2026, Mountain Pass will begin producing separated Dy₂O₃.  MP has signaled objective to ramp NdPr to >5,000 t/yr by mid-decade, which would yield some co-product heavy-REE (Dy) output.  Combined with new projects, a U.S. Dy₂O₃ output in the low hundreds of tons/year by 2030 is plausible.  For example, USA Rare Earth’s Round Top project (Texas) – already demonstrated on a sample basis – contains significant heavy-REE (Y, Dy, Tb) in its yttrofluorite ore.  The company recently produced a 99.1% pure Dy₂O₃ sample from Round Top ore ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/28/3016281/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-Achieves-Breakthrough-in-Domestic-Rare-Earth-Production.html#:~:text=project%2C%20successfully%20producing%20a%20sample,1%20wt)).  If Round Top is financed and built, it could add dozens of tonnes of Dy₂O₃ annually.  In sum, U.S. industry aims to reach roughly 100–200 t/yr Dy₂O₃ (and Y₂O₃/Tb₄O₇) by 2030 via MP and new HREE projects ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/28/3016281/0/en/USA-Rare-Earth-Achieves-Breakthrough-in-Domestic-Rare-Earth-Production.html#:~:text=project%2C%20successfully%20producing%20a%20sample,1%20wt)).  

- **Canada:**  The SRC facility (monazite SX) is slated for completion in the mid-2020s, with design outputs on the order of tens of tonnes of various RE oxides per year.  If operating as planned, it might supply on the order of 20–30 t/yr Dy₂O₃ by 2030.  Additional Canadian projects (e.g. Vital Metals’ Nechalacho, which hosts xenotime-rich zones) could potentially contribute, but none are currently producing.  Overall, a realistic Canadian Dy₂O₃ output by 2030 might be in the tens of tonnes if all projects mature.  

- **Australia:**  Lynas’ Heavy RE separation in Malaysia will gradually ramp to process Dy/Tb.  In addition, Lynas is expanding its Mt Weld resources and Kalgoorlie processing, which together may double Lynas’ REO output.  By 2030, Australia could potentially supply on the order of 50–100 t/yr Dy₂O₃ (Lynas output plus any new HREE projects).  A suspended project, Northern Minerals’ Browns Range (a xenotime-rich deposit), if restarted, could also add unusual HREE material.  For now, Australia’s baseline Dy₂O₃ output will come from Lynas (likely a few tens of tonnes by 2030).  

- **EU/Norway/Iceland:**  Barring new surprises, domestic supply remains negligible through 2030.  Currently no HREE mine or commercial processing is operating in Europe.  Some early-stage exploration (e.g. in Finland, Greenland) exists, but none will deliver HREE by 2030.  The EU’s strategy is to rely on imports and recycling.  Recycling might recover ~10–20 t/yr Dy₂O₃ by 2030 (from magnets), but primary output will remain ~0.  

- **Japan:**  No domestic mines or refurbishers of Dy are planned.  Japan’s industry will continue to import all Dy₂O₃, supplemented by magnet recycling initiatives (which might recover on the order of 10–30 t/yr Dy₂O₃ by 2030).  Japan is also investing in alternative motor technologies (reducing Dy use) and global supply partnerships, but no new domestic Dy supply is expected.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Airborne radiometrics; geochem; hyperspectral; drilling*  

• **Airborne Radiometric and Magnetic Surveys:**  High-resolution airborne geophysics is a key exploration tool for REE. Gamma-ray spectrometry can detect radioelement anomalies (U/Th/K) associated with monazite yields; it highlighted the Mountain Pass and other deposits.  Airborne magnetics and gravity surveys map buried carbonatite/alkaline intrusions that often host REEs ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/airborne-geophysics-rare-earth-element-deposits-agreed#:~:text=The%20USGS%20Airborne%20Geophysics%20for,compliment%20the%20airborne%20geophysical%20analyses)).  The USGS AGREED project and other studies demonstrate that joint radiometric (monazite indicator) and magnetic (rock tube) data significantly narrow REE targets ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/airborne-geophysics-rare-earth-element-deposits-agreed#:~:text=The%20USGS%20Airborne%20Geophysics%20for,compliment%20the%20airborne%20geophysical%20analyses)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/complex-carbonate-ore-mineralogy-mountain-pass-carbonatite-rare-earth-element-deposit#:~:text=structurally%20abundant%20in%20bastn%C3%A4site%2C%20whereas,ore%20processing%20and%20magnet%20manufacture)).  

• **Geological Mapping & Geochemical Sampling:**  Field geology focuses on known REE-bearing terrains (carbonatites, alkaline complexes, heavy-mineral sands).  Systematic stream-sediment and soil geochemistry (analyzing rare-earth patterns and pathfinder elements like Nb, Zr, Y) is used to flag anomalies.  In many REE provinces, elevated Y concentrations in till/stream sediments have been successfully used to locate heavy-REE occurrences. These classical geochemical methods remain fundamental to REE discovery.  

• **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:**  Visible/shortwave-infrared imaging (satellite or aerial) can identify REE-associated alteration minerals (e.g. bastnäsite, xenotime alteration halos).  While REE minerals themselves lack distinctive spectral signatures, alteration minerals (carbonates, clay-rare-earth complexes) can be mapped.  Emerging drone-mounted hyperspectral surveys are now deployed in remote exploration areas in Canada, Australia, and Africa to screen broad regions for rare-earth mineralization.  

• **Drilling & Geochemical Profiling:**  Targets defined by surficial tests are followed by systematic drilling.  High-precision multi-element assays (ICP-MS) of drill core quantify REE grades and ratios.  Automated mineralogy (QEMSCAN, MLA) identifies the specific REE-bearing minerals (bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime, allanite, etc.) and their liberation characteristics.  Down-hole geophysics (e.g. spectral gamma, magnetic susceptibility) aids structural interpretation.  Together, drillholes and core analysis confirm resource potential and are the final proof-of-concept for new REE projects.  

• **Ion-Adsorbed Clay Assessment:**  Although rare outside China, weathered granite-hosted (“ion-adsorbed”) REE deposits can exist.  Explorers test potential sites using ammonium sulfate leach tests on soil/rock to quantify exchangeable REEs.  This method, borrowed from China’s clay mines, is being evaluated on prospective clay horizons in the US and elsewhere, but in the West it remains mostly at the experimental/prospecting stage. Employees and universities are adapting Taiwan/China techniques to search for domestically emplaced HREE-rich clays.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Open-pit mining; flotation; gravity/magnetic pre-concentration; chemical cracking; dry-stack tailings*  

• **Open-Pit Mining & Milling:**  Rare-earth ore bodies (e.g. carbonatites, ionic clays, heavy sands) are typically mined via open-pit methods (drill-blast-load-haul).  At Mountain Pass and Mt Weld, large open pits feed jaw crushers and SAG/ball mills to reduce ore to ~<75 µm for liberation ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/product/bastnaesite-concentrate#:~:text=Bastnaesite%20concentrate%20serves%20as%20a,edge%20industries)).  The crushed and milled material is then processed through concentrators.  

• **Flotation Concentration:**  Froth flotation is the standard method for bastnäsite-dominant ores.  Collectors (typically carboxylic or hydroxamic acid based) selectively render REE-carbonates hydrophobic, allowing separation from quartz/carbonate gangue.  Depressants like sodium silicate suppress gangue minerals.  For example, MP Materials reports its bastnäsite concentrate contains >62% TREO ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/product/bastnaesite-concentrate#:~:text=Bastnaesite%20concentrate%20serves%20as%20a,edge%20industries)), achieved via optimized flotation.  Research literature (e.g. Xiong et al., 2019) confirms hydroxamate collectors (e.g. salicylhydroxamic acid) and fatty-acid collectors achieve good bastnäsite recovery in acidic pH regimes.  Multi-stage flotation circuits routinely deliver ~60–70% REO recovery to concentrate.  

• **Gravity & Magnetic Separation:**  Heavy-mineral sand and vein deposits often use gravity and magnetics prior to flotation.  Spirals, shaking tables, and high-intensity magnetic separators can pre-concentrate monazite and xenotime based on their higher density (≈4.6–4.7 g/cc) and magnetic susceptibility relative to common gangue.  These physical methods are especially useful for placers (e.g. Brazil, India) and coarse alluvial-like ores.  For example, Allison et al. (2021) demonstrated that a Falcon UF separator significantly boosts bastnäsite-grade while rejecting barite/calcium gangue ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/389282376_A_Review_of_Rare_Earth_Elements_Recovery_from_Bastnaesite_Ore_From_Beneficiation_to_Metallurgical_Processing#:~:text=Article)).  Such steps reduce acid consumption downstream and improve overall recovery.  

• **Acid Baking/Leaching:**  Concentrated REE minerals (e.g. monazite, xenotime, apatite) require chemical digestion.  Sulfuric acid baking is widely used: ores are mixed with H₂SO₄ and roasted (≈200–300°C) to form soluble RE sulfates.  Subsequent water-leaching then pulls REEs into solution.  Alternatively, alkaline cracking (NaOH autoclave at ~140–180°C) has been applied to refractory phosphates (monazite): the ore is fused with NaOH to yield soluble NaREO₂, which is then water-leached.  Both routes achieve high (>90%) RE yield.  For instance, Kim et al. (2020) report that high-temperature H₂SO₄ roasting can convert >97% of RE oxides into soluble form ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=sulfuric%20acid%29%20followed%20by%20water,compounds%20are%20mostly%20leached%20in)).  These leach solutions (rich in REEs) are then fed to separation circuits.  

• **Dry-Stack Tailings & Water Recycling:**  Environmental regulations are pushing the industry toward dry-stacked tailings.  At Mountain Pass, filter presses dewater flotation tailings to ~15–20% moisture, creating a stackable “filter cake” that is stored in lined cells.  This eliminates slurry ponds, reduces land footprint, and allows >95% water recovery.  Filtrate is returned to circuits via settling ponds and reverse-osmosis.  Modern REE plants (e.g. just-built Wyoming and Australian facilities) are aiming for closed-loop water use (>90–95% recycling) and zero liquid discharge.  MP Materials reports recycling >95% of process water at Mountain Pass, aligning with its compliance.  

• **In-Situ Recovery (Experimental):**  China’s ion-adsorbed clay mines use direct in-situ leaching (ammonium sulfate or chloride solutions pumped into clay deposits).  This technology is still experimental in the U.S. Any identified ion-exchange clays would be tested by heap or in-situ leaching.  Research (e.g. NETL projects) is examining whether dilute NH₄₂SO₄ solutions could economically leach HREE from Western clay profiles.  To date, no Western REE project has implemented commercial ISR, but the concept remains under study.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion exchange/chromatography; crystallization; ionic liquids; emerging membranes*  

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):**  The industry-standard separation method.  REE chloride or sulfate solutions are treated with organic extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, PC-88A, Cyanex 272, mixtures) in counter-current mixer-settler cascades.  Multi-stage SX achieves group separation (lighter REE vs heavy REE families) and then individual element purification.  For instance, Dy/Tb separation typically requires 50+ SX stages due to very similar chemistry ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=sulfuric%20acid%29%20followed%20by%20water,compounds%20are%20mostly%20leached%20in)).  SX is capital-intensive (many stages) and generates organic waste, but it yields high-purity rare-earth oxides.  

• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatography:**  Downstream of coarse separation, continuous chromatographic systems can refine REE mixtures.  Techniques like “simulated moving bed” chromatography with specialized resins (e.g. sulfonated resins like Amberlite) or chelating polymers selectively trap individual lanthanides.  Continuous (SMB) systems offer higher purity and lower solvent use than SX.  For example, companies like ReElement Technologies and Savannah Resources are piloting continuous ion-exchange separation for HREEs.  Ion exchange is particularly attractive for HREEs (Dy/Tb) because their distribution coefficients differ subtly from lighter REEs.  

• **Fractional Crystallization/Precipitation:**  An old but still-used method.  After SX, REEs can be selectively crystallized as double sulfates, nitrates, or oxalates by careful pH and reagent control.  For example, Dysprosium can be precipitated by ammonium hydroxide or oxalic acid from mixed RE solutions.  Fractional precipitation can produce group concentrates (e.g. “light sulfate”, “heavy sulfate”) that feed final purification.  While slower than SX, crystallization uses inexpensive reagents and can be used for fine polishing.  

• **Task-Specific Ionic Liquids (ILs):**  Novel extractants: room-temp ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents have been demonstrated for REE extraction.  For instance, IL systems based on phosphonium or amide ions can exhibit strong selectivity for Dy vs Nd in bench tests ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=sulfuric%20acid%29%20followed%20by%20water,compounds%20are%20mostly%20leached%20in)).  Research (e.g. Sunderland et al., 2024) shows some task-specific ILs achieve high Dy/Nd separation factors without volatile organics.  These systems are not yet commercial but promise greener processes (nonvolatile, recyclable).  

• **Membrane Separation:**  Emerging membrane-based processes (liquid membranes, polymer inclusion membranes) are being explored.  Functionalized membranes can continuously separate REEs by selective transport.  For example, experimental studies (e.g. Kujawa et al., 2024) report liquid-liquid membrane modules that enrich Dy over Nd in one pass.  These technologies are still in R&D; no large-scale plant exists, but membranes could greatly reduce chemical use.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Molten-salt electrolysis; metallothermic reduction; vacuum distillation; zone refining; magnet alloying*  

• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:**  The standard route for metal production from oxides.  Dy₂O₃ is dissolved in a molten fluoride salt (e.g. LiF-DyF₃) and subjected to electrolysis at ≈850–1100°C.  Dysprosium metal is deposited at the cathode while oxygen (as CO/CO₂ or O₂) evolves at the anode.  This yields high-purity Dy metal. MP Materials is constructing a fluoride electrolysis plant in Texas for producing 99.9% Dy and Tb metals.  Literature (e.g. Sakamoto, 2017) reports Dy metal of 99.9% purity from molten LiF-DyF₃ electrolysis; oxygen-evolution anodes (e.g. graphite) or inert anodes (e.g. yttria-stabilized zirconia) are used.  

• **Metallothermic Reduction:**  Alternate method using reactive metals.  DyF₃ or Dy₂O₃ can be mixed with calcium or lithium metal and heated (1200–1400°C, inert atmosphere).  The Ca (or Li) reduces Dy to metal, forming CaO (or Li₂O) slag.  After cooling, residual reactant is removed by vacuum distillation.  For example, Ca-grain reduction followed by distillation yields >99.5% Dy.  These “Calciothermic” processes are used for specialty lanthanides in small batches, as they avoid electrolytic cells.  

• **Vacuum Distillation/Sublimation:**  To further purify Dy metal, vacuum distillation can be applied.  Dy boils/sublimes at ≈1400°C at low pressure.  Impurities with different vapor pressures (Fe, Ni, etc.) remain in the residue or distill separately.  Multiple passes of vacuum distillations (in tantalum boats or cold crucible) can achieve 99.99% purity.  Research (e.g. Honda et al., 2002) shows Dy can be refined by multi-stage vacuum transport, removing metallic and gaseous impurities.  This is important for creating ultra-high-purity Dy for research alloys.  

• **Zone Refining:**  A solidification-based purification.  Dysprosium metal bars can be purified by moving a molten zone along the solid rod.  Impurities concentrate in the molten zone and travel to one end, which is cut off.  Techniques like electron-beam or induction zone melting allow achieving 5N (99.999%) Dy.  Zone refining is used only for lab/semiconductor-grade Dy (very niche).  

• **Alloying & Powder Metallurgy:**  In magnet manufacturing, Dy metal is alloyed into Nd–Fe–B.  Common practice is grain-boundary diffusion or co-melting: Dy (2–6 wt%) is added to the melt.  The alloy is strip-cast and hydrogen-decrepitated into magnetic powders.  Dy atoms preferentially sit at grain boundaries, raising coercivity.  The final sintered magnet has slightly lower remanence but much higher Hci.  This magnet metallurgy is a form of “chemical refinement” – Dy is precisely metered.  Industry reference: (Saito et al., 2019) describe making Dy-alloyed NdFeB powders via strip casting and HDDR (hydrogenation-disproportionation-desorption-recombination).  

• **Recycling Technologies:**  Secondary Dy is recovered from scrap NdFeB magnets.  Established processes use hydrometallurgy: magnets are demagnetized, dissolved in acid (HCl, HNO₃), then SX is used to regenerate Dy/Tb oxides ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/recycling-kick-long-term-solution-eu-rare-earths-challenge-2024-06-27/#:~:text=EU%20companies%20are%20focusing%20on,portion%20of%20its%20rare%20earths)).  More novel methods include electrochemical dissolution of shredded magnets and molten salt recycling.  For example, Dowa’s process dissolves magnet scrap in nitric acid and SX recovers Dy.  Direct recycling (H₂-reduction of scrap to metal sponges) is also under development.  By 2030, recycling could supply a growing fraction of Dy for magnets, but will supplement rather than replace primary sources.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: Dry-stack tailings; water recycling; neutralization; reagent recovery; engineered barriers*  

• **Dry-Stacked Tailings:**  Instead of ponded tailings, modern REE plants use filter presses to dewater slurries to ~15–20% moisture, producing stackable tailings cakes.  This “dry stacking” prevents dam failures and reduces footprint.  Mountain Pass pioneered this approach and recycles stack pore water.  Covers (geomembrane/clay) over stacks prevent infiltration and radon escape.  Continuous monitoring (leachate collection, gas) is required.  Some projects aim to meet rigorous mine closure standards by end-of-life (e.g. Nevada-type covers).  

• **Water and Chemical Recycling:**  Closed-loop circuits recycle >90–95% of process water.  Clarifiers, filters, and RO plants purify and return water to the plant.  SRC’s upcoming plant, for example, is designed for near-zero discharge (100% water recycling).  Chemicals are also recovered: spent acids can be regenerated by diffusion dialysis or distillation, and organics (from SX) are recovered by scrubbers/distillation and reused.  Recoveries of >70–90% are routine for major reagents in modern hydrometallurgy.  

• **Neutralization & Precipitation:**  Any bleed streams (e.g. acid or alkaline wastes) must be neutralized.  Calcium hydroxide (lime) is added to acidic tails to pH 7–9, precipitating REEs and heavy metals as hydroxides.  Radionuclides (U, Th) are co-precipitated (e.g. radium as RaSO₄ using BaCl₂).  Solids are removed by settling or filtration before water is discharged or reused.  Typical practice meets drinking-water quality for effluent.  For example, NEI and MP report that effluent radioactive levels are orders of magnitude below regulators’ limits after precipitation.  

• **Reagent Recovery:**  Spent organic solvents (hydrocarbons from SX) are regenerated by scrubbing and distillation.  Rare-earth-laden strip-acids are processed in closed circuits.  Sulfuric or hydrochloric acid from leach can be partially recovered by diffusion dialysis or evaporative crystallization.  Efficient plants aim to reuse >80% of fresh chemicals, greatly reducing costs and waste.  For instance, US patent filings and DOE reports note >90% recycle of extraction acids is achievable.  

• **Radioactivity Management:**  Most REE ores (monazite, xenotime) contain U/Th.  Mills segregate these from product stream.  Thorium is often separated as insoluble byproduct and stored or sold (e.g. in LD slag), while U is similarly immobilized.  Regulations require precipitation of Ra (with BaCl₂ to form Ba(Ra)SO₄) and placement of U/Th-rich solids in engineered waste storage.  Tailings often have <100 ppm Th and <50 ppm U; management includes thickened tailings, liners, and monitoring wells.  

• **Engineered Barriers:**  Closure plans use multi-layer covers on tailings stacks (clay/geomembrane barrier + drainage layer + topsoil and vegetation).  These prevent infiltration and radon escape.  Any remaining impoundments use lined containment.  Continuous monitoring (groundwater wells, radon sensors) is planned for decades.  Regulatory guidance (e.g. U.S. Mine Safety and Health regulations, NRC guidelines for radium) drive design.  For example, modern tailings designs follow standards set by the EPA’s 40 CFR Part 61.  

## Key Bottleneck Summary  
Allied mining can supply mixed REE concentrates, but **separating and refining Dy** remains the critical gap.  Heavy-REE processing (solvent extraction trains, molten-salt electrowinning) is complicated and currently almost entirely Chinese.  Despite plenty of mineral reserves (e.g. monazite, xenotime), the US/allies lack comparable HREE refinery capacity ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=The%20U,heat%20permanent%20magnets.%20China%27s)) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx?hubs_content=thehustle.co%2Fwhere-business-is-headed-in-2023-highlights-from-3-reports&hubs_content-cta=null&hubs_post-cta=homepage#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  Unless major investments are made in domestic heavy-REE midstream plants or breakthrough recycling, allied Dy supply will fall far short of projected 2030 demand.  Without these capabilities, any new mines would still need China’s technology to produce usable Dy products.
