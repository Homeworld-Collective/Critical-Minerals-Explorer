## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
- **USA (Mountain Pass)** – The only active US rare-earth mine is MP Materials’ Mountain Pass (California). In 2024 it produced a record ~45,000 tonnes of rare-earth oxides (REO) concentrate in-place ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,approximately%201%2C300%20metric%20tons%20of)). Mountain Pass ore is rich in light RE (La, Ce), with much smaller heavy-REE content; heavy RE (including Dy) comprise only a few percent of the REO. Thus US-derived dysprosium output is on the order of only a few hundred tonnes of Dy₂O₃ per year (mostly implicit in REO concentrate); MP is expanding to separate Dy but has not yet published standalone Dy volumes.   
- **Australia (Lynas)** – Australia’s Lynas Rare Earths (Mt Weld mine plus concentrator, processing in Malaysia) is the largest non-Chinese source. In FY2024 Lynas produced ~10,908 t of total rare-earth oxide (REO) ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=total%20REO%20production%20was%2010%2C908,the%20capacity%20expansion%20were%20completed)). Mt Weld ore has a relatively high heavy-REE content (Mt Weld bastnäsite is ~14% CeO₂ plus significant NdPr; heavy REEs including Dy, Tb are present in Nd/Ba phosphates at a few percent). Lynas has now demonstrated “first commercial” heavy-rare-earth production (Dy/Tb separations) in its Malaysia plant ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/lynas-rare-earths-2025-production-milestone/#:~:text=First%20Commercial%20Heavy%20Rare%20Earths,Production%20Outside%20China)). Australia’s current Dy output is thus modest, mostly as Dy₂O₃ and Dy metal byproducts from Lynas’ NdPr/cracking operations.   
- **Canada** – No commercial Dy mining/production exists today. The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) is piloting a processing facility (using monazite feed) and, with Canadian government funding, aims to produce ~20 t/yr of Dy₂O₃ (plus ~5 t/yr Tb₂O₃) ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2024/02/canada-to-boost-supply-of-critical-minerals-and-strengthen-value-chains-with-investment-in-the-saskatchewan-research-council.html#:~:text=,half%20a%20million%20electric%20vehicles)). This “rare earth processing facility” (at demo scale) would alone represent North America’s first significant domestic Dy output if realized. Otherwise Canada’s current Dy production is effectively zero (all rare-earths are imported or recycled).  
- **European Union / Norway / Iceland** – No active rare-earth mines or Dy production operate in Europe or other NATO allies (apart from small pilot projects). Proposed projects (e.g. Tasman Metals in Greenland, Arafura in Romania) were delayed; only minor NdPr processing (e.g. Solvay† in Estonia) exists, with virtually no heavy-REE (Dy) capacity. Thus domestic EU/Norway/Iceland Dy supply is currently negligible.  
- **Japan** – Japan has no domestic mining of rare earths (Dy or otherwise). It relies entirely on imports (mostly from China/Myanmar). Japan does have advanced magnet/coating industries and has started end-of-life magnet recycling, but still obtains almost all Dy raw material from abroad. Current Japanese Dy production is effectively zero.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
- **Electric Vehicle Traction Motors:** EVs use Nd–Fe–B permanent magnets that often contain 1–5% Dy₂O₃ to boost high-temperature performance. Polk projections of EV adoption (US/EU/Japan all targeting large EV fleets by 2030) imply strong Dy demand.  For reference, SRC notes that 20 t/yr Dy₂O₃ would supply magnets for ~500,000 EV motors ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2024/02/canada-to-boost-supply-of-critical-minerals-and-strengthen-value-chains-with-investment-in-the-saskatchewan-research-council.html#:~:text=,half%20a%20million%20electric%20vehicles)).  If US, EU and Japan reach ~10–20 million EVs/year by 2030, Dy demand just for EV magnets could easily be on the order of hundreds of tonnes (300–800 t/yr Dy₂O₃). (Exact figures depend on motor design – e.g. some designs use <1 kg Dy per car, others up to 2–3 kg.)  
- **Wind-Turbine Generators:** Offshore and onshore wind turbines increasingly use Nd–Fe–B permanent-magnet generators with small Dy additions (<1% of magnet weight).  For example, a large turbine (~10 MW) might contain several kg of Dy.  Europe’s planned 380 GW offshore by 2030 (GWEC target) implies ~tens of tonnes of Dy₂O₃ demand.  Combined US/EU wind expansion could add a similar order (50–200 t). While smaller than EV use, wind still drives thousands of tons of Nd–Pr and propor­tionally moderate Dy demand.  
- **Other Uses:** Dysprosium is also used in specialty alloys (e.g. dysprosium-containing superalloys for high-temperature use), in nuclear control rods (Dy absorbs neutrons), and in phosphors/lasers (though those consume only ≪1% of total Dy). Growth in robotics, drones, and defense systems (hunters and radars) adds to magnet-related demand.  Overall, permanent-magnet EV/wind applications dominate.  Global magnet-REE demand is forecast to rise ~5× by 2040 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20market%20for%20magnet,over%20the%20same%20period)); by 2030 allied usage is likely (very roughly) in the range of a few hundred up to ~1,000 t/yr Dy₂O₃, reflecting surging EV and renewables growth.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
- **USA:** Domestic mining and processing will increase but remain modest vs. projected demand. MP Materials is building a Stage II separator for heavy RE (including Dy) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=process%20heavy%20rare%20earth%20elements,will%20be%20built%20at%20Mountain)); when operational (~late 2020s) it will allow Mountain Pass to produce separated Dy₂O₃ (instead of sending heavy portion to China).  USA Rare Earth’s Round Top (Texas) project – if financed – could produce significant HREE-rich concentrate (Round Top is rich in Y, Dy, Tb) for conversion to Dy₂O₃.  Overall, US Dy output by 2030 might reach a few hundred tonnes of Dy₂O₃/year (including MP’s output + any new projects).  
- **Canada:** If SRC’s funded plant is built (with Monarch Heavy RE feed), it would add up to ~20 t/yr Dy₂O₃ by the mid-2020s ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2024/02/canada-to-boost-supply-of-critical-minerals-and-strengthen-value-chains-with-investment-in-the-saskatchewan-research-council.html#:~:text=,half%20a%20million%20electric%20vehicles)). No mines produce Dy in Canada yet, so all additional supply depends on such demonstration plants or new mining projects.  
- **Australia:** Lynas is expanding. It achieved first separated heavy RE production (including Dy) in Malaysia ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/lynas-rare-earths-2025-production-milestone/#:~:text=First%20Commercial%20Heavy%20Rare%20Earths,Production%20Outside%20China)) and plans full HREE output by ~2025 ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/lynas-rare-earths-2025-production-milestone/#:~:text=First%20Commercial%20Heavy%20Rare%20Earths,Production%20Outside%20China)). With Lynas’ heavy line and any new domestic projects (rare calcium-REE veins underway), Australia could potentially supply on the order of 50–100 t/yr Dy₂O₃ by 2030. Mt Weld’s ore contains notable Y (critical strategic) and some Dy, so as Lynas increases total REO output (10,900 t in FY2024 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=total%20REO%20production%20was%2010%2C908,the%20capacity%20expansion%20were%20completed))) the Dy share could proportionally rise.  
- **EU/Norway/Iceland:** Projected domestic supply is essentially zero for 2030. EU still expects to rely on imports; no operational HREE mine or plant exists. Planned projects (e.g. Norra Kärr in Sweden, Nechalacho in Canada with offtake by allies) face delays. The EU may source about 10–20 t/yr Dy₂O₃ from scrapped magnets by 2030, but primary supply remains imports.  
- **Japan:** No new domestic sources; Japan will continue to import almost all Dy raw material. It has policies to increase scrap magnet recycling (e.g. Toyota’s magnet recovery), but these will contribute at most a few tens of tonnes by 2030. Japan’s supply will thus depend heavily on allied imports (e.g. specialty separations from Lynas or US sources) and Chinese sources.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Airborne Radiometric and Magnetic Surveys:** Many REE deposits contain uranium/thorium and dense minerals. Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry can highlight anomalies (U/Th peaks near carbonatites). Airborne magnetics and gravity surveys detect buried carbonatite or alkaline intrusions (e.g. Montana’s Mountain Pass is a carbonatite with a magnetic signature). Several large REE deposits worldwide (e.g. China’s Bayan Obo, Australia’s Mt Weld) were first identified by radiometric and magnetic anomalies.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Mapping of known REE-bearing rock types (carbonatites, alkaline complexes, monazite-bearing sands) narrows search. Geochem sampling (soil/stream sediments and outcrop) for light/heavy RE oxides, yttrium or associated elements (Nb, Zr) can flag anomalies. For example, anomalous Ce+La in stream sediment may lead to a bastnäsite carbonatite; similarly, unusual fluoride, niobium or niobate minerals can indicate heavy-REE carbonatites. Geologic mapping identifies pegmatites or alkali intrusions that often host REE.  
• **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:** Visible/infrared remote sensing of outcrops can detect alteration minerals (like kaolinite from REE hydrothermal fluids) or carbonatite minerals (calcite, barite). Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras are increasingly used to survey inaccessible outcrops for RE-bearing minerals.  
• **Drill Testing and Geochemical Profiling:** Once targets are defined, systematic drilling with down-hole surveys and core geochemistry (e.g. multi-element ICP–MS) quantifies Dy or Y concentrations in rocks. Identification of high-Y/Dy zones in monazite or xenotime helps confirm a heavy-REE resource.  
• **Ionic Adsorption Clay Screening (Asia-specific):** Although not in US/allies, this is noted: specialized leach tests on weathered clays can find ion-adsorbed rare earths (common in China/SE Asia). Allied exploration may focus instead on deep-bedrock targets, but any discovery of ion-adsorbed Dy clays in British Columbia or Australia would use sequential leach geochemistry.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Mining & Milling:** Rare-earth deposits (e.g. Mt Weld, Mountain Pass) are typically mined by large-scale open-pit methods (drill-blast-truck/shovel) using high-capacity shovels and haul trucks to feed crushing circuits. High-grade ore (>~8–15% TREO) at Mountain Pass and Mt Weld allows well-scaled pits. The ore is crushed (jaw/HPGR) and milled (ball/rod mills) to fine particles (sub-75 µm) for concentrating.  
• **Flotation Concentration:** Sulfuric-acid or caustic digestion followed by froth flotation is a standard method to concentrate bastnäsite/carbonatite ore. At Mountain Pass, crushed bastnäsite is sulfided and depressed to float RE minerals; likewise, Mt Weld uses flotation to produce ~8% TREO concentrate. Flotation separates carbonate or phosphate RE-oxides from gangue (calcite, barite) with reagents (collectors like NaSH, depressants).  
• **Gravity & Magnetic Separation:** For heavy-mineral sands (monazite/thorium-bearing), gravity and magnetic separators (spirals, shaking tables, high-intensity magnetic separators) pre-concentrate heavy minerals. If any ionic clays or heavy-mineral sands were mined, gravity methods help isolate REE-bearing phases (monazite is magnetic under certain conditions).  
• **Acid Baking/Leaching:** Bastnäsite (fluorocarbonate) is often decomposed by roasting (900–1000 °C) to convert Ce and La to insoluble forms, then leached with weak acids. Mountain Pass uses a unique dry roasting step to control cerium oxidation, then water to slurry. Alkaline or acid leaching dissolves the REE into solution, leaving gangue. (For example, Mountain Pass historically used a soda-ash digestion for monazite pockets.)  
• **Dry Stack Tailings & Water Recycling:** Mountain Pass pioneered dry-stack tailings (filtering all slurry into a moist filter cake) to minimize tailings volume ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/sustainability/#:~:text=Dry%20Stack%20Tailings)). This eliminates wet ponds and allows >95% water recycling. Similarly, new plants aim for >90% reagent/water recycle. Saskatchewan’s new plant is designed for “net-zero liquid discharge” by recycling 100% of processing water ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2024/02/canada-to-boost-supply-of-critical-minerals-and-strengthen-value-chains-with-investment-in-the-saskatchewan-research-council.html#:~:text=,derived%20from%20SRC%E2%80%99s%20existing%20facility)). Such closed-loop operations conserve water and prevent contamination, which is critical for brightening social license.  
• **In-Situ Leaching (Experimental):** Not yet commercial for REEs, but researchers have demonstrated that weak acids (ammonium sulfate, citric or low-M) can leach some clay-hosted RE deposits. If a suitable orebody (e.g. in Wyoming or Texas) is amenable, in-situ or heap leaching could be a low-impact extraction option in the future.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The industry standard for isolating individual RE oxides from mixed leach liquor. Organic extractants (e.g. di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid – D2EHPA, and neutral extractants like TBP or Versatic acid 10) are used in mixer-settler trains to sequentially separate La, Ce, Pr, Nd from the heavy lanthanides (Sm–Lu and Y) by adjusting pH and stripping steps. For example, after Nd/Pr are removed, further SX stages separate Dy and Tb from erbium/ytterbium based on slight differences in their extractability at specific acidity. Companies like Shin-Etsu (Japan), Ionic Technologies (USA), and Carester (France) are adapting SX processes for cleaner separation of HREE such as Dy/Tb ([www.idtechex.com](https://www.idtechex.com/fr/research-article/how-magnets-are-reshaping-rare-earth-supply-demand-and-recovery/31923#:~:text=Long,ReElement%20uses%20a%20chromatographic%20separation)).  
• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatography:** Ion-exchange resins can separate lanthanides by exploiting tiny differences in ionic radii/complexation. Some Japanese processes (Hirano, Sogabe) use mesoporous adsorbents to isolate Dy from Nd. A novel approach is chromatographic separation: ReElement (USA) and Mitsubishi/Elemech (Japan) are developing continuous chromatographic columns where an RE-loaded solution passes through resin columns that selectively bind each RE element in sequence. ReElement’s ionic column tech reportedly recovers >99% of Nd, Pr, Tb, Dy by cycling pH or complexant eluents ([www.idtechex.com](https://www.idtechex.com/fr/research-article/how-magnets-are-reshaping-rare-earth-supply-demand-and-recovery/31923#:~:text=Long,ReElement%20uses%20a%20chromatographic%20separation)), with far less organic waste than classic SX.  
• **Crystallization/Precipitation:** Sequential precipitation can aid purity. For example, oxalate precipitation at carefully controlled pH and temperature can fractionate La, Ce, Pr/Nd, then leftover Sm/Tb/Dy oxalates. Adjusting the sulfate or chloride salt concentration and solvent can selectively crystallize specific REE compounds.  Similarly, fractional crystallization of rare-earth double sulfates has been studied as a low-waste alternative (with limited scale so far).  
• **Ionic Liquid Extraction:** An emerging method uses task-specific ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents as alternatives to traditional organics. These can be tuned to preferentially bind certain lanthanides. For example, ionic-liquid systems have achieved Dy/Pr separation factors comparable to SX without volatile solvents. If scaled, they could reduce solvent losses and environmental impact – still R&D-stage.  
• **Electrochemical Separation:** Laboratory methods like electodeposition (pulled precipitation by galvanostatic control) are being explored to directly plate out Nd or Dy from solution. Also, pyrometallurgical electrometallurgical cells (molten salt with selective electrodes) could one day differentiate RE elements by ionic mobility. These remain mostly experimental but could be vital future bottleneck-breakers.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Once Dy₂O₃ is obtained, it must be converted to metal. In a key development, MP Materials acquired an electrolytic cell (“Independence” facility) that converts Dy/Tb/Nd oxides to 99.5%+ pure metals ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=,%28Photo%3A%20Business%20Wire)). In molten calcium chloride at ~700–800 °C, RE chlorides (made by reacting oxides with chlorine or CaCl₂) are electrolyzed, plating out Dy metal at the cathode. This molten-salt electrolysis (similar to Hall‐Héroult for aluminum) is one major route for high-purity Dy.  
• **Metallothermic (Calcium/Magnesium) Reduction:** A classic route is mixing Dy oxide or fluoride with metallic Ca or Mg powder and heating (thermite-style). The Ca/Mg reduces Dy to metal (forming CaO or MgO slag). This process is widely used in China for lanthanide and actinide metals. Residual Ca/MgO is vacuum-leached out. It achieves ~99% pure Dy metal. Allied labs (e.g. US Ames Lab) have demonstrated such Ca-reduction for Nd/Dy.  
• **Vacuum Distillation/Zone Refining:** To further purify dysprosium metal, vacuum distillation can exploit Dy’s vapor pressure. Inert gas at ~2000 °C drives off lighter lanthanides, leaving Dy behind (similarly used for Nd/Pr refining). Alternatively, vacuum-filled or cold-crucible plasma zone refining sweeps impurities. These very-high-purity processes (often performed by specialty metal firms) yield 4N–5N Dy metal needed for aerospace/nuclear grades.  
• **Alloying:** Most Dy is not sold as pure element but immediately alloyed (e.g. Dy–Fe–Co) for use in NdFeB or magnets. Melt-spinning or powder metallurgy can incorporate dysprosium into magnetic grain boundaries. Purification at alloying stage includes directional solidification and hydrogen decrepitation to remove inclusions.   
• **Hydrometallurgical Recycling:** For end-of-life magnets or scrap (mostly NdFeB containing <1% Dy), hydromet routes (as in Tianqi’s recycling) dissolve the magnets in acid, then use SX or ion-sorbents to recover Dy alongside Nd. Companies like ReElement (USA) use combined mechanical/electrochemical steps to recover Dy from scrap directly into oxide or metal. This closes the loop on Dy without mining.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Dry-Stacked Tailings:** Mountain Pass’s dry-stack tailings (filter cake) virtually eliminate liquid discharge and seepage ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/sustainability/#:~:text=Dry%20Stack%20Tailings)). This method (dewatering tailings to a solid, stored under cover) is being adopted by new RE projects to prevent soil/groundwater contamination by radioactive thorium or heavy metals.  
• **Water and Chemical Recycling:** New rare-earth plants in allied nations are designed for near-zero liquid effluent. For example, SRC’s proposed facility in Canada will recycle ~100% of process water and chemicals (net-zero discharge) ([www.canada.ca](https://www.canada.ca/en/natural-resources-canada/news/2024/02/canada-to-boost-supply-of-critical-minerals-and-strengthen-value-chains-with-investment-in-the-saskatchewan-research-council.html#:~:text=,derived%20from%20SRC%E2%80%99s%20existing%20facility)). Dry-stack tailings combined with closed-loop reagent systems keep both water use and chemical effluent minimal.  
• **Neutralization and Filtration:** Spent process liquor containing residual acids is neutralized with lime or limestone to precipitate heavy metals and radionuclides (Th/U), which are then filtered out. Advanced filter presses and reverse osmosis membranes can remove dissolved contaminants. These techniques are standard in alumina/bauxite processing and are applied to RE refining wastes.  
• **Reagent Recovery:** Spent organic solvents from SX (e.g. degraded D2EHPA) are regenerated or reclaimed to minimize waste. Distillation and solvent purification systems are used to burn off degradation products and recycle extractants.  
• **Bioremediation (Research):** Experiments (chiefly overseas) have shown certain bacteria or algae can accumulate rare earths or uranium from tailings. Phytoremediation (using trees like willows) is being trialed to stabilize tailings piles and uptake mobile U/Th, though this remains experimental.  
• **Engineered Barrier Coverage:** Mine waste impoundments are covered with geomembranes and vegetation to prevent acid-weathering release and radon emanation. This is standard (and was retrospectively applied at Mountain Pass) to lock down any residual radioactivity in tailings.

## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The chief bottleneck is **heavy-REE separation and refining**.  Currently ~90–100% of global dysprosium/Tb separation capacity resides in China ([www.idtechex.com](https://www.idtechex.com/fr/research-article/how-magnets-are-reshaping-rare-earth-supply-demand-and-recovery/31923#:~:text=The%20high%20regional%20concentration%20of,manufacturing%20stages%20occur%20in%20China)). Western allies can mine RE oxides, but turning those concentrates into isolated Dy₂O₃ or Dy metal is costly and technologically challenging.  For example, the Mountain Pass Stage II (HREE separation) plant under construction ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=process%20heavy%20rare%20earth%20elements,will%20be%20built%20at%20Mountain)) is the first US facility of its kind.  Until such plants come online and prove economical at scale, allied producers will struggle to convert minor heavy-REE fractions into usable dysprosium products. In short, the lack of midstream hydrometallurgical plants (solvent-extraction lines, molten-salt electrolysis, etc.) devoted to heavy RE elements is the critical bottleneck in building a domestic Dy supply chain.

## Key Bottleneck Summary  
Allied mining capacity (e.g. new US/Australian mines) can deliver mixed rare-earth concentrates, but **separating and refining Dy** remains the Achilles’ heel. Heavy-REE processes (solvent extraction trains, electrolytic metal production) are complex and currently centralized in China.
