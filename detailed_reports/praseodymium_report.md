## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Solvent extraction and ion exchange separation capacity*

The critical bottleneck is **limited domestic processing capacity**, especially Stage II separation and finishing. While Mountain Pass can mine concentrate containing ~15,000 t/yr REO, its new separation plant output was only ~1,300 t NdPr oxide in 2024. Likewise, allied projects (Arafura, SRC, Solvay) are just coming online. Meeting demand by 2030 hinges on rapidly scaling solvent extraction (SX) and ion exchange (IX) refineries and magnet plants. Without this, raw ore must continue flowing overseas for processing, primarily to China.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
Domestic NdPr production is constrained by separation and refining throughput. For example, MP Materials' Stage II separation only yielded ~1,300 t NdPr oxide in 2024 despite having access to concentrate containing ~15,000 t of mixed REO. In short, **insufficient separation/refinement capacity** is the bottleneck – until more SX/IX trains and refining (NdPr metal and magnet) plants are built, allied production cannot scale to meet 2030 demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~2,000-3,000 tons/year praseodymium oxide equivalent*

• **US (Mountain Pass, CA):** Only one active domestic rare-earth mine. 2024 production was ~43,000 t of concentrate containing approximately 15,000 t of mixed rare-earth oxides (REO), including neodymium and praseodymium. MP Materials separated ~1,300 t of NdPr oxide in 2024, corresponding to approximately 300-350 tonnes of praseodymium oxide (assuming Pr comprises ~25% of NdPr).

• **Canada:** No significant mining yet; processing emerging. The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) produces NdPr metal from imported concentrates. SRC's new facility (Saskatoon) was producing ~10 t/month (120 t/yr) of NdPr metals in late 2024, scaling to ~40 t/month (~400 t/yr) target by 2025. This represents approximately 25-100 tonnes of praseodymium metal annually.

• **Australia (Lynas):** Lynas Rare Earths' Mt Weld mine produced ~7,000 t/yr of NdPr oxide in FY2024. In Q3 FY2025, Lynas reported 1,509 t of NdPr oxide production, with ~6,000 t NdPr oxide expected for full FY2025. This corresponds to approximately 1,500 tonnes of praseodymium oxide annually.

• **EU/Norway/Iceland:** Currently **none**. No rare-earth mine or oxide separation plant is operating in the EU, Norway, or Iceland. All NdPr materials are imported, primarily from China (~90% of supply).

• **Japan:** No domestic mining. Japan relies entirely on imported REE (mostly from China and allied sources) for NdPr materials. Any "domestic production" is limited to value-added refining of imported concentrates.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 2,500-5,000 tons/year praseodymium oxide equivalent*

• **Electric Vehicles (NdFeB magnets):** EV growth is the largest driver of NdPr demand. Outside China, ~20-25 million EVs are forecast by 2030. Each typical EV contains ~1-2 kg of NdPr oxide. Allied EV production could require 20,000-40,000 t of NdPr oxide, implying approximately 5,000-10,000 t of praseodymium oxide for EV motors by 2030.

• **Wind Turbines:** Direct-drive and high-performance turbines require large NdFeB magnets. IEA/IRENA models project ~250 GW annual wind installations globally by 2030. With ~200 kg NdPr/MW for direct-drive turbines, and assuming 30% use permanent magnets, this equates to ~15,000 t NdPr/yr globally. If US/EU account for ~30% of installations, allied wind demand could be ~4,500 t NdPr (approximately 1,100 t praseodymium) per year.

• **Other Magnet Uses:** Industrial motors, robotics, hard disk drives, and defense applications. These sectors currently consume ~30% of global NdPr and could add another 2,000-3,000 tonnes NdPr (500-750 tonnes praseodymium) to allied demand.

• **Summary Estimate:** Combined allied NdPr demand by 2030 is projected at 25,000-45,000 t/yr of NdPr oxides, corresponding to roughly 6,000-11,000 t/yr of praseodymium oxide. Current global NdPr demand is ~70,000 t/yr and expected to reach ~100,000 t/yr by 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 3,000-5,000 tons/year praseodymium oxide equivalent*

• **Mountain Pass (USA):** MP Materials aims to expand concentrate production with Stage II separation targeting 5,000-7,000 t/yr of NdPr oxide by 2027-2028. This would yield approximately 1,200-1,750 tonnes/year of praseodymium oxide. The Fort Worth, TX magnet plant targets 1,000 t/yr of finished NdFeB magnets starting 2025.

• **USA Rare Earth (Round Top, TX):** Heavy-REE focused deposit under development; minimal light REE (Nd/Pr) contribution expected before 2030.

• **Lynas (Australia):** Continuing ~7,000 t/yr NdPr oxide capacity (approximately 1,750 t praseodymium). U.S. processing facility (Texas) under construction for downstream processing.

• **Arafura Resources (Australia):** Nolans project targeting first production 2027-2028. Phase 1 expects 4,400 t/yr of NdPr oxide when operational, providing approximately 1,100 tonnes praseodymium oxide annually.

• **Canada (Vital Metals/SRC):** Vital Metals' Nechalacho (NWT) under development. SRC targeting 400 t/yr of NdPr metals by 2025 (approximately 100 t praseodymium metal). Overall Canadian output by 2030 might reach 500-1,000 t/yr NdPr if projects advance.

• **EU (incl. Norway/Iceland):** By 2030 domestic mining remains unlikely. Solvay's La Rochelle refinery (France) will process imported materials. LKAB's Swedish deposits and other projects unlikely to produce before 2035.

• **Japan:** No domestic mining planned; continued reliance on imports and downstream processing.

• **Recycling (Allies-wide):** Emerging magnet recycling may contribute 500-1,000 tonnes NdPr/yr by 2030 (125-250 tonnes praseodymium), but primary mining will dominate supply.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Radiometric surveys; hyperspectral imaging; geochemical sampling; magnetic/gravity surveys*

• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne or ground gamma-ray surveys identify thorium/uranium associated with monazite/bastnäsite deposits. Many carbonatite and ion-adsorption REE deposits discovered using this method.

• **Geologic Mapping and Sampling:** Traditional mapping of carbonatites, alkaline intrusions, and pegmatites. Geochemical prospecting using soil/rock/stream sediment assays for cerium, lanthanum, neodymium, and yttrium anomalies identifies REE mineralization footprints.

• **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:** Airborne or satellite multispectral and hyperspectral sensors detect Nd/Pr-bearing minerals' absorption features. Imaging spectrometers (HySpex, AVIRIS) have successfully mapped Nd-enriched zones in carbonatites.

• **Geophysical Surveys:** Airborne magnetics and gravity delineate dense carbonate bodies or igneous intrusions. Magnetotelluric (MT) and seismic methods image deep structures. Electromagnetic surveys highlight conductivity contrasts in weathered zones.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Flotation concentration; acid/alkaline leaching; roasting; heap/in-situ leaching*

• **Flotation & Physical Concentration:** Primary ore (bastnäsite, monazite) is crushed, ground, and concentrated via froth flotation. Mountain Pass uses flotation to achieve 60% REO concentrate. Magnetic and electrostatic separation further upgrade concentrates.

• **Roasting and Leaching:** Monazite concentrates roasted with NaOH or H₂SO₄ at 400-500°C to decompose minerals and separate thorium/uranium. Roasted material leached in acid (HCl or H₂SO₄) to dissolve REEs. Bastnäsite uses direct acid leaching or caustic cracking.

• **Heap and In-Situ Leaching:** Ion-adsorption clay deposits extracted using heap leaching with ammonium sulfate solutions. In-situ recovery (ISR) being tested for low-grade deposits, potentially reducing environmental impact.

• **Solvent Extraction Pre-treatment:** Pregnant leach solutions undergo iron removal via pH adjustment and precipitation. Impurities (Fe, Al, Th) precipitated as hydroxides, yielding clean REE-bearing solution for separation.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Multi-stage solvent extraction; ion exchange chromatography; selective precipitation*

• **Multi-Stage Solvent Extraction:** Industry standard using counter-current mixer-settlers with organic extractants (D2EHPA, PC-88A, Cyanex 272). Typically requires 30-50 stages to separate Nd from Pr due to similar chemistry. Each stage yields incrementally purer streams.

• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:** Alternative to solvent extraction using chelating resins in continuous columns. Emerging technologies like continuous chromatography reduce organic solvent use and improve selectivity.

• **Selective Precipitation:** pH-controlled precipitation removes specific elements. Heavy REEs precipitated as oxalates or phosphates. Fine-tuned pH adjustments enable partial separation of light REEs including praseodymium.

• **Electrochemical Techniques:** Research-stage electrowinning and electrodialysis methods for REE separation. Not yet commercially deployed for Nd/Pr separation at scale.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Oxide calcination; metallothermic reduction; powder metallurgy; zone refining*

• **Oxide Precipitation and Calcination:** Separated REE solutions neutralized to pH 8-10 to precipitate hydroxides/carbonates. Filtered precipitates calcined at 700-900°C to produce high-purity oxides (Pr₆O₁₁ or Pr₂O₃, 99.5%+ purity).

• **Metallothermic Reduction:** Praseodymium oxide reduced to metal via calcium reduction at 1,000°C under argon, or molten salt electrolysis at 850°C. Produces 99%+ pure Nd-Pr alloy for magnet production.

• **Powder Production (HDDR/Strip-casting):** Hydrogen Decrepitation Desorption Recombination (HDDR) process creates fine NdFeB alloy powder. Strip-casting produces thin ribbons rapidly solidified and processed into powder for sintered or bonded magnets.

• **Zone Refining/Electrorefining:** Ultra-high purity (99.9%+) achieved through vacuum zone melting or fused salt electrorefining. Removes trace impurities (Fe, Si, C) for specialty applications.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Magnet recycling; tailings neutralization; phytoremediation; closed-loop processing*

• **Magnet Recycling (Short-Loop):** Recovery from end-of-life NdFeB magnets via hydrogen decrepitation or hydrometallurgical dissolution. Current recycling rates <1% but growing. New chromatographic methods achieve >95% recovery efficiency.

• **Tailings Neutralization:** Acid mine drainage neutralized with lime or caustic soda. REEs and base metals precipitated as hydroxides. Gypsum precipitation immobilizes residual thorium/uranium in stable mineral forms.

• **Phytoremediation:** Hyperaccumulator plants (e.g., ferns, vetiver grass) extract REEs from contaminated soils. Research shows certain plant combinations can extract REEs from tailings, though commercial viability remains unproven.

• **Microbial Bioremediation:** Acidophilic bacteria (Acidithiobacillus spp.) bioleach REEs from low-grade waste. Fungi and bacteria studied for metal binding and tailings stabilization.

• **Closed-loop Processing:** Reagent recycling reduces waste generation. Solvent extraction organics regenerated via washing. Ion exchange resins regenerated with acid stripping. Zero-liquid discharge systems prevent environmental releases.
