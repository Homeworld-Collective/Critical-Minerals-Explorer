## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is **limited midstream (Stage II) refining capacity**.  For example, MP Materials’ Mountain Pass mine produced a record 45,455 metric tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) in concentrate in 2024, but separated only ~1,294 t of NdPr oxide ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results/#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)) (≈320 t Pr₂O₃ assuming ~25% Pr in NdPr).  Allied projects (e.g. Arafura’s Nolans, SRC Saskatoon, Solvay La Rochelle) are just coming online and cannot yet meaningfully raise NdPr output.  Without rapidly deploying more solvent-extraction (SX) and ion-exchange (IX) trains – as well as more NdPr metal and magnet plants – raw rare-earth concentrates will continue to be sent overseas (mostly to China) for processing ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions/#:~:text=Four%20decades%20ago%2C%20Solvay%E2%80%99s%20rare,the%20world%E2%80%99s%20processed%20rare%20earths)) ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/nolans-neodymiumpraseodymium-rare-earths-project-australia-update-2025-08-22#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20expected%20to,acid%20at%20144%20393%20t%2Fy)).  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Domestic NdPr supply is currently limited by low separation/refinement throughput.  In 2024 Mountain Pass had access to ~45,000 t of upstream rare-earth concentrate but only achieved ~1,300 t NdPr oxide production ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results/#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)).  In short, **insufficient SX/IX refining capacity** is the bottleneck – until dozens more separation stages and magnet precursor plants are built, allied production cannot scale to projected 2030 demand ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results/#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions/#:~:text=Four%20decades%20ago%2C%20Solvay%E2%80%99s%20rare,the%20world%E2%80%99s%20processed%20rare%20earths)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
* **US (Mountain Pass, CA):** Only one US REE mine.  In 2024 MP Materials reported ~45,455 t of REO in concentrate (record high) but only ~1,294 t of separated NdPr oxide ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results/#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)) (≈320 t Pr₂O₃).  
* **Canada (Saskatchewan):** No domestic REE mining yet; SRC’s Saskatoon plant (built with government funding) began converting foreign REE concentrates to metal in 2024.  It achieved ~10 t/month NdPr metal mid-2024, scaling to ~40 t/month (~480 t/yr) by late 2024 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2609433-saskatchewan-starting-production-of-rare-earth-metals#:~:text=SRC%20now%20plans%20to%20increase,400%20t%2Fyr%20of%20NdPr%20metal)) (~120→480 t/yr NdPr, roughly 30–120 t Pr₂O₃).  
* **Australia (Lynas Mt Weld):** Lynas produced ~5,655 t NdPr oxide in FY2024 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=1117%20%20,Total%20NdPr%20production)) (≈1,414 t Pr₂O₃).  Arafura’s Nolans (Central Australia) aims for ~4,440 t/yr NdPr oxide when operational (~2027–28) ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/nolans-neodymiumpraseodymium-rare-earths-project-australia-update-2025-08-22#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20expected%20to,acid%20at%20144%20393%20t%2Fy)) (≈1,110 t Pr₂O₃).  
* **EU/Norway/Iceland:** None.  No REE mines or NdPr separations currently operate in Europe or Iceland.  Europe imports nearly all its NdPr materials, and ~90% of global REE processing occurs in China ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions/#:~:text=Four%20decades%20ago%2C%20Solvay%E2%80%99s%20rare,the%20world%E2%80%99s%20processed%20rare%20earths)).  
* **Japan:** None.  Japan has no domestic REE production; it relies entirely on imports of NdPr feed and intermediate products (historically >90% from China, now >60% ([www.cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/rare-earths-japan-more-prepared-than-most-for-chinas-mineral-squeeze.html#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20Japan%27s%20overall,data%20provided%20by%20Argus%20Media))).  Japanese industry focuses on downstream refining and magnet manufacture rather than mining.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
* **Electric Vehicles:** EV growth is the largest driver of NdPr demand.  By 2030 global EV fleets (excluding China) are projected to reach on the order of 20–25 million units.  Each EV motor typically contains **~1–2 kg of NdPr oxide** ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/lynas-ndpr-production-increase-2025-expansion/#:~:text=Neodymium%20,any%20commercially%20available%20magnet%20type)), implying roughly **20,000–50,000 t NdPr oxide** needed for allied EVs (equivalent to ~5,000–12,500 t Pr₂O₃).  
* **Wind Turbines:** Direct-drive and high-performance turbines employ large permanent magnets.  Modern wind generators require on the order of **200–250 kg NdPr oxide per MW** (e.g. ~600 kg for a 3 MW turbine ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/lynas-ndpr-production-increase-2025-expansion/#:~:text=Neodymium%20,any%20commercially%20available%20magnet%20type))).  IEA/IRENA model ~250 GW/yr of new global wind capacity by 2030.  If ~30% of that uses PM generators, demand is ~15,000 t NdPr (≈3,750 t Pr₂O₃) globally.  If U.S./EU account for ~30% of installations, allied wind demand would be **~4,500 t NdPr** (about 1,125 t Pr₂O₃) annually.  
* **Other Magnet Uses:** Industrial motors, robotics, electronics (e.g. HDDs, servos), and defense applications currently consume on the order of 25–30% of global NdPr.  Continued growth in automation and green industry could add a few thousand tonnes NdPr demand by 2030 (on the order of **2,000–3,000 t NdPr**, i.e. ~500–750 t Pr₂O₃).  
* **Summary Allied Demand:** Combined non-China NdPr oxide demand by 2030 is thus on the order of **25,000–45,000 t/yr** (≈6,000–11,000 t/yr Pr₂O₃).  For perspective, current world NdPr demand is roughly 70,000–80,000 t/yr and is expected to approach ~100,000 t/yr by 2030.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
* **Mountain Pass (USA):** MP Materials is rapidly expanding.  Its “Upstream 60k” expansion aims to raise annual REO concentrate to ~60,000 t by the late 2020s ([www.forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2025/04/23/will-america-finally-set-a-sane-path-forward-for-rare-earth-elements/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%E2%80%99ve%20now%20scaled%20production%20at,line%20production%20to%2060%2C000%20tons.%E2%80%9D)).  Correspondingly, Stage-II refining is planned to reach ~5,000–7,000 t/yr NdPr oxide by 2027–28 (≈1,200–1,750 t Pr₂O₃).  MP’s new Fort Worth (TX) magnetics plant is slated for ~1,000 t/yr NdFeB magnet output starting ~2025.  
* **USA Rare Earth (Texas Round Top):** Primarily a heavy-REE deposit, with only modest Nd/Pr content.  No significant NdPr output is expected before 2030; initial phases will focus on heavy-REE and base-metal coproducts.  
* **Lynas (Australia):** Mt Weld will continue producing ~5,500–7,000 t/yr NdPr oxide (≈1,400–1,750 t Pr₂O₃) in the near term.  Lynas’s planned Texas processing plant (greentree REE project) will handle heavy REEs and some NdPr feedstock.  
* **Arafura (Australia, Nolans):** Phase 1 slated for production ~2027–28, with ~4,440 t/yr NdPr oxide ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/nolans-neodymiumpraseodymium-rare-earths-project-australia-update-2025-08-22#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20expected%20to,acid%20at%20144%20393%20t%2Fy)) (~1,110 t Pr₂O₃).  Phase 2 (if extended) could further increase capacity.  
* **Canada (Vital Metals SRC & Nechalacho):** SRC expects ~400 t/yr NdPr metal (≈100 t Pr) by 2025 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)) via its Saskatoon facility.  Vital Metals’ Nechalacho deposit (NWT) is high in heavy-REE and relatively low in Nd/Pr; any NdPr output (perhaps a few hundred tonnes/yr) would likely come after 2025.  Combined Canadian NdPr output by 2030 might reach a few hundred tonnes, modest compared to demand.  
* **EU (incl. Norway/Iceland):** No significant mining or refining by 2030.  Solvay’s revived La Rochelle plant (France) will process imported concentrate (targeting ~2,000–5,000 t/yr of rare-earth oxides ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions/#:~:text=Eventual%20production%20could%20range%20from,alloys%20or%20magnets%2C%20she%20added))) but will focus on separation only.  Other projects (e.g. LKAB’s Kiruna or Arctic deposits) are unlikely to yield NdPr products before 2035.  
* **Japan:** No domestic mining or Stage II; continued reliance on imports and toll-processing of allied-source concentrates (e.g. Lynas).  
* **Recycling (Allies-wide):** Magnet recycling is growing but small.  Short-loop recycling (from manufacturing scrap, EoL magnets) might contribute **~500–1,000 t/yr NdPr** (≈125–250 t Pr₂O₃) by 2030.  However, primary mining and processing will dominate supply; closed-loop recycling can improve yields and reduce waste but will not fully replace mines by 2030 ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452223624000051#:~:text=Acid%2010%20leaching%20was%20suggested,4%7D%20solution.%20Almost)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Rare earth minerals (e.g. monazite, xenotime) commonly contain Th/U, giving strong radioactivity.  Airborne/ground gamma-ray surveys can detect thorium/uranium anomalies associated with carbonatite and monazite-bearing deposits ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264647626_Rare_earth_minerals_and_the_geochemistry_and_implications_of_their_respective_uranium_and_thorium_contents#:~:text=rare%20earth%20minerals%20to%20an,or%20laterite%20deposit%2C%20with%20any)) ([se.copernicus.org](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/13/497/2022/#:~:text=were%20identified%20in%20the%20Siwana,and)).  Many REE discoveries have been guided by Th/U signatures.  
• **Geologic Mapping & Geochemistry:** Field mapping of carbonatite bodies, alkaline intrusions and pegmatites remains fundamental.  Systematic sampling (rocks, soils, stream sediments) with multi-element analysis can reveal elevated La, Ce, Nd, Y patterns that outline REE mineralization footprints.  For example, surface sampling in Rajasthan carbonatites highlights NdPr targets ([se.copernicus.org](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/13/497/2022/#:~:text=were%20identified%20in%20the%20Siwana,and)).  
• **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:** Imaging spectrometers (airborne or spaceborne) can identify REE-bearing minerals via diagnostic absorption features.  For instance, Boesche et al. (2015) demonstrated airborne hyperspectral mapping (HySpex sensor) of Nd absorption in a carbonatite outcrop, producing qualitative Nd-enrichment maps ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/5160#:~:text=mapping%20the%20distribution%20of%20neodymium,the%20HySpex%20imaging%20spectrometer%20system)).  Such VNIR–SWIR hyperspectral data are increasingly used to noninvasively locate Nd/Pr-rich zones in REE targets.  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Airborne magnetics and gravity are effective in outlining dense carbonate (bastnäsite) or magnetite-rich carbonatite bodies.  High-resolution aeromagnetic surveys have been recommended for REE prospectivity (e.g. mapping buried carbonatites in India ([se.copernicus.org](https://se.copernicus.org/articles/13/497/2022/#:~:text=were%20identified%20in%20the%20Siwana,and))).  Electromagnetic/magnetotelluric methods may detect deep conductive zones or alteration halos.  Combined geophysical models (mag, gravity, MT) help focus ground follow-up.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Flotation & Physical Concentration:** Raw REE ore (bastnäsite, monazite, etc.) is crushed and milled, then concentrated by froth flotation.  Typical REE concentrate grades can reach ~60% total rare-earth oxide (TREO) using flotation, plus magnetic/electrostatic upgrading ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687513003452#:~:text=SX%20is%20the%20main%20technology,or%20produce%20mixed%20rare%20earths)).  For example, Mountain Pass uses multi-stage flotation and high-intensity magnetic separation to produce a dense REE concentrate.  
• **Roasting and Leaching:** Monazite concentrates (containing Th/U phosphates) are often roasted with NaOH or H₂SO₄ (≈400–500 °C) to destroy the phosphate lattice and liberate REEs ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337467790_Decomposition_of_mixed_rare_earth_concentrate_by_NaOH_roasting_and_kinetics_of_hydrochloric_acid_leaching_process#:~:text=A%20new%20clean%20extraction%20technology,0%20mol%2FL)).  The roasted residue is then leached with acids (HCl or H₂SO₄) to dissolve REEs while precipitating Th/U.  Bastnäsite (fluorocarbonate) can be acid-leached directly or **caustic-cracked** with NaOH/CaO before leaching.  Alkaline roasts convert REE fluorocarbonates to chlorides/oxides for easier extraction.  
• **Heap and In Situ Leaching:** Low-grade ion-adsorption clay deposits (common in China) use heap-leaching with ammonium sulfate or chloride solutions.  Emerging techniques involve in-situ or low-impact bioleaching.  For example, heap-leaching of ion-adsorption ore with bio-derived citrate achieved ~98% REE recovery in pilot tests ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37429479/#:~:text=effectively%20recover%20REEs%20and%20reduce,extraction%20to%20solve%20the%20environmental)).  Such methods promise more environmentally benign extraction from weathered clays.  
• **SX Pre-treatment:** Before separation, PLS is conditioned to remove impurities.  This typically involves pH adjustment (e.g. adding lime or Na₂CO₃) to precipitate Fe, Al, and actinides.  For instance, Li et al. (2025) showed >99% Fe removal at pH≈3.5 and ~95% Th removal at ~pH3.6 (with added H₂O₂) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12058999/#:~:text=composite%20design%20,Thermodynamic%20models%20supported%20experimental%20findings)), with minimal REE loss.  The clarified solution (REE-rich) then proceeds to separation.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Multi-Stage Solvent Extraction:** The industry standard for light REE separation.  Counter-current SX in mixer-settlers uses organics like D2EHPA, PC-88A, Cyanex 272, etc.  Typically dozens of stages are used – Nd and Pr require many stages due to their chemical similarity.  Binnemans et al. (2014) note that complete REE separation schemes can involve **up to hundreds** of mixer-settler stages ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687513003452#:~:text=For%20process%20configuration%2C%20up%20to,and%20settlers%20may%20be%20used)).  Each stage incrementally enriches Nd vs Pr or other REEs.  
• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:** Chelating resins (e.g. iminodiacetate or aminophosphonic types) in packed-bed or continuous columns can replace SX for certain streams.  Continuous chromatographic processes have been piloted to avoid organic solvents and improve single-column separations of light REEs.  Emerging technologies (stacked columns, simulated moving beds) are being demonstrated for Nd/Pr separation with high purity and lower footprint.  
• **Selective Precipitation:** Carefully controlled pH or oxalate/phosphate addition can selectively precipitate groups of REEs.  For example, light REEs (like Ce) can be partially precipitated by adjusting pH, while heavy REEs are held in solution.  Raf van Putten style methods use oxalic or sulfide precipitation to isolate specific REE hydroxides or carbonates.  Such precipitation steps often follow SX tails to recover remaining REEs.  
• **Electrochemical Methods:** Research-stage methods like electrowinning or electrodialysis are being explored for REE separation.  For instance, electrodialysis membranes with REE-selective ionophores can fractionate Nd/Pr under an electric field.  However, no large-scale Nd/Pr electro-separation plant exists yet due to technical and cost challenges.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Oxide Precipitation and Calcination:** After SX/IX separation, REE-enriched solutions are processed by precipitating REEs (as hydroxides, carbonates or oxalates) using alkali or oxalate.  The precipitate is filtered, washed, and then **calcined** (700–900 °C) to yield high-purity Nd/Pr oxides (e.g. Nd₂O₃, Pr₆O₁₁ >99.5%).  Precise pH, reagent choice and temperature control are used to ensure minimal co-precipitation of impurities.  
• **Metallothermic Reduction:** NdPr oxide is converted to metal by alloyed calcium reduction or molten salt electrolysis.  The *calciothermic* process mixes Nd/Pr oxide with metallic calcium (at ~1,000 °C under inert Ar), yielding NdPr alloy and CaO slag.  Alternatively, molten chloride electrolysis (850–900 °C) can directly produce low-carbon NdPr alloy.  These produce Nd–Pr alloys (≥99% purity) for magnet-making.  
• **Powder Production (HDDR/Strip-Casting):** Refined Nd–Pr–Fe–B alloy (typically ~30% NdPr, 68% Fe, plus B) is turned into magnet powder.  Hydrogen decrepitation (HDDR) involves hydrogenating the alloy (causing it to fracture), then removing H₂ to yield fine particles.  Strip-casting rapidly solidifies thin NdFeB ribbons for subsequent milling.  These processes control grain size/composition.  The resulting powder is charged into sintering furnaces or bonded magnet presses.  
• **Zone Refining/Electrorefining:** For ultra-high purity REE metals (<10 ppm impurities), vacuum zone melting or fused-salt electrorefining are used.  In zone refining, a molten zone is slowly passed along a metal ingot to sweep out impurities.  In electrorefining, pure NdPr metal is deposited from a salt (e.g. LiCl–KCl) electrolyte.  Such refinement is mostly used for specialty applications needing 99.99%+ purity.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Magnet Recycling (Short-Loop):** End-of-life NdFeB magnets can be recycled via hydrogen decrepitation or acid dissolution.  In H₂-decrepitation, scrap magnets are hydrogenated (expanding and cracking the alloy) and then milled into powder; REEs are then recovered by acid leach or melt.  Recent reviews report that advanced recycling flowsheets can recover **≥95% of NdPr** from scrap, with <1% Fe contamination ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2452223624000051#:~:text=Acid%2010%20leaching%20was%20suggested,4%7D%20solution.%20Almost)).  Closed-loop processes can return recovered Nd/Pr to new magnets.  Overall recycling currently <1% of supply, but improving collection and technologies.  
• **Tailings Neutralization:** Acidic wastes from leaching are neutralized (lime or NaOH) to precipitate Fe/Al and co-precipitate residual REEs.  For example, adding lime to REE tailings causes ferric/Al hydroxides and gypsum to form, immobilizing thorium and other actinides in stable minerals.  Remaining sludge can sometimes be reprocessed to extract residual REEs.  *Closed-loop* SX plants also regenerate organics and recycle precipitants to minimize effluent.  
• **Phytoremediation:** Certain plants (e.g. vetiver grass, ferns) can accumulate REEs from soil.  Research has shown hyperaccumulator species (e.g. some Helenium, Lonicera varieties) uptake Nd/Pr in mM concentrations.  Phytomining trials are underway, but commercial viability is not yet proven.  Phytoremediation could help stabilize REE-contaminated sites or extract residual REEs from mine tailings over many seasons.  
• **Bio/Microbial Leaching:** Acidophilic microbes (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus*, *Penicillium*) can enhance REE extraction from ores or wastes.  Studies have demonstrated bioleaching of oversize ores or residues to release additional REEs.  For example, heap bioleaching of ion-adsorption clays with citrate or microbial metabolites can achieve high REE recovery ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37429479/#:~:text=effectively%20recover%20REEs%20and%20reduce,extraction%20to%20solve%20the%20environmental)).  These bioprocesses remain mostly R&D but offer potential environmentally friendly methods to recover REEs from low-grade sources.
