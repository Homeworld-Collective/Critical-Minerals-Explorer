## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **US (Mountain Pass, CA):** Only one active domestic rare-earth mine. 2024 production was ~45,000 t of mixed REO concentrate ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) (all-time high for US), containing roughly 50,000–55,000 t of rare-earth oxides (including Nd and Pr).  In that year MP Materials also separated ~1,300 t of NdPr oxide (see mp-2024 report) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  This corresponds to on the order of a few thousand tonnes of praseodymium (oxide) in US output.  
• **Canada:** No significant mining yet; processing emerging.  The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) produces NdPr metal from imported concentrates.  SRC’s new facility (Saskatoon) was running ~10 t/月 (120 t/yr) of NdPr metals in 2024 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)), scaling to ~40 t/月 (≈400 t/yr) by 2025 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%20in%20early,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)).  (No other Canadian mines exist; Vital Metals’ Nechalacho deposit is under development.)  
• **Australia (Lynas):** Lynas Rare Earths’ Mt Weld mine produced ~9–10,000 t/yr of REO concentrate (fiscal FY2024/25 target ~10,500 t) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2682432-australia-s-lynas-cuts-jan-mar-rare-earth-oxide-output#:~:text=Lynas%20left%20its%20total%20oxide,two%20quarters%20of%20declining%20output)).  In Jan–Mar 2025 Lynas reported 1,509 t of NdPr oxide (79% of its output) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2682432-australia-s-lynas-cuts-jan-mar-rare-earth-oxide-output#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%201%2C911t%20of%20rare,see%20table)), and ~4,478 t NdPr oxide in the first nine months of FY2025 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2682432-australia-s-lynas-cuts-jan-mar-rare-earth-oxide-output#:~:text=y,30)).  (Other projects like Arafura’s Nolans are not yet in production.)  
• **EU/Norway/Iceland:** Currently **none**.  No rare-earth mine or oxide plant is operating in the EU or Norway/Iceland ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/mining-firm-europes-largest-rare-earths-deposit-found-in-sweden/#:~:text=No%20rare%20earth%20elements%20are,percent%20of%20the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20supply)).  All NdPr materials are imported (imports to EU were ~12,900 t total REE in 2024, mostly from China).  Planned projects (e.g. Solvay’s La Rochelle plant) may supply processing by late 2020s ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions-2025-04-08/#:~:text=committing%20to%20a%20full,to%20reduce%20reliance%20on%20China)), but today “Europe currently mines no REE” ([www.politico.eu](https://www.politico.eu/article/mining-firm-europes-largest-rare-earths-deposit-found-in-sweden/#:~:text=No%20rare%20earth%20elements%20are,percent%20of%20the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20supply)).  
• **Japan:** No domestic mining.  Japan relies entirely on imported REE (mostly from China and allied sources) for NdPr materials ([www.ctvnews.ca](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/first-of-its-kind-facility-hopes-to-launch-canada-into-rare-earths-market-1.7043486#:~:text=NdPr%20powers%20the%20strongest%20type,market%2C%20according%20to%20the%20SRC)).  Any “domestic production” is limited to value-added refining (e.g. Nippon Yttrium, Hitachi Metals) of imported concentrates.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Electric Vehicles (NdFeB magnets):**  EV growth is the largest driver of NdPr demand.  Outside China, ~40 million EVs are forecast by 2035 ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/rare-earth-magnet-market-could-be-worth-5bn-outside-china/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20EVs%20produced,5%20billion%20at%20current%20prices)).  Neo Performance (Canada) estimates these 40 M EVs will require ~60,000 t of RE-based magnets (≈18,000 t NdPr oxides) ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/rare-earth-magnet-market-could-be-worth-5bn-outside-china/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20EVs%20produced,5%20billion%20at%20current%20prices)).  Even by 2030, allied EV production could be ~20–30 million vehicles, implying on the order of 6,000–10,000 t of NdPr oxide (⇒ ~1,500–2,500 t Pr) for EV motors alone.  (For example, each typical EV contains ~1 kg of NdPr oxide ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=We%20estimate%20that%20an%20EV,annual%20demand%20of%20c%20100%2C000t)).)  Over 85% of worldwide EV motors use NdFeB magnets ([www.electricvehiclesresearch.com](https://www.electricvehiclesresearch.com/articles/31923/how-magnets-are-reshaping-rare-earth-supply-demand-and-recovery#:~:text=rare%20earth%20magnets%20are%20commonly,instruments%2C%20and%20audio%20speaker%20equipment)) ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/rare-earth-magnet-market-could-be-worth-5bn-outside-china/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20EVs%20produced,5%20billion%20at%20current%20prices)), so US/EU/Japan demand will be thousands of tonnes/yr by 2030.  
• **Wind Turbines:**  Direct-drive and high-performance turbines require large NdFeB magnets.  Wind energy build-outs under net-zero scenarios add tens of GW/year.  IEA/IRENA models (Net-Zero 2050) imply ~250 GW annual wind installations by 2030.  With ~91 t NdPr/GW (average onshore+offshore) ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=Roughly%2022,source%3A%20IRENA)), this equates to ~22,700 t NdPr/yr global by 2030.  If US/EU jointly account for ~40–50% of that growth, allied wind demand could be ~9,000–12,000 t NdPr (≈2,300–3,000 t Pr) per year.  
• **Other Magnet Uses:**  Smaller contributions come from industrial/consumer magnets (motors, robotics, HDDs) and defense (missile/weapon systems).  Already in 2022 globally 15% of NdPr was used in EV motors and 18% in wind generators ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=Total%20global%20demand%20for%20NdPr,vehicles%20and%20automation%20more%20generally)). By 2030 allied industrial demand could add another few thousand tonnes NDPr (a few hundred tonnes Pr).  
• **Summary Estimate:** Taken together (EVs, wind, etc.), US+Allies NdPr demand by 2030 is likely on the order of 10,000–20,000 t/yr of NdPr oxides (implying roughly 2,500–5,000 t/yr of praseodymium **oxide/metal**) ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=Total%20global%20demand%20for%20NdPr,vehicles%20and%20automation%20more%20generally)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions-2025-04-08/#:~:text=committing%20to%20a%20full,to%20reduce%20reliance%20on%20China)).  For context, current global NdPr demand is ~50,000 t/yr ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=Total%20global%20demand%20for%20NdPr,vehicles%20and%20automation%20more%20generally)) and expected to roughly double by 2030 ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=We%20estimate%20that%20an%20EV,annual%20demand%20of%20c%20100%2C000t)) ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=Roughly%2022,source%3A%20IRENA)), so allied demand will be thousands of tonnes.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Mountain Pass (USA):** MP Materials aims to expand Stage I to ~60,000 t/yr of REO concentrate (all rare-earth oxides) by ~2027 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136824000014/mp-20231231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L3702%20grow%20our,next%20four%20years%20with%20modest)).  Its Stage II separation plant will then yield several thousand tonnes/year of NdPr oxide.  MP’s new Independence, TX magnet plant (Stage III) is slated for ~1,000 t/yr of finished NdFeB magnets (from 2025 onward) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20is%20addressing%20this,and%20processing%20facility%20in%20California)), providing about an additional few hundred tonnes of NdPr metal annually (once ramped).  
• **USA Rare Earth (Round Top, TX):** Heavy-REE deposit (dysprosium, terbium) under development; unlikely to contribute significant Nd/Pr (light RE) by 2030.  
• **Lynas (Australia):** Continues ~10,500 t/yr REO (mostly NdPr) capacity.  Plans are advancing for U.S. processing (Texas facility) and Malaysian refinements, which could increase Allied NdPr oxide output modestly by 2030.  
• **Arafura Nolans (Australia):** Targeted first production ~2026+.  Phase 1 expects ~11,000 t/yr of NdPr oxide from Nolans (monazite carbonatite) when operational, making it one of the few large non-Chinese Nd/Pr sources.  (Offtake deals cover >3,600 t so far ([au.investing.com](https://au.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-arafura-advances-ndpr-oxide-project-targets-fid-in-h2-2024-93CH-3224325#:~:text=%2A%20Arafura%20has%20binding%20off,half%20of%20the%20year%2C%20with)).)  
• **Canada (Vital Metals/SRC):** Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (NWT) is slated to produce separated NdPr oxides (5–10% NdPr grade) from mid-2020s (on the order of 1,000s t/yr NdPr).  SRC will supply ~400 t/yr of NdPr **metals** by 2025 ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%20in%20early,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)). Overall Canadian output by 2030 might be ~several hundred to **1,000+** t/yr NdPr (oxides/metals) if projects succeed.  
• **EU (incl. Norway/Iceland):** By 2030 domestic output remains limited.  Solvay’s La Rochelle RE refinery (France) plans to process ~30% of EU NdPr demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions-2025-04-08/#:~:text=committing%20to%20a%20full,to%20reduce%20reliance%20on%20China)), but that is a processing step rather than new oxide production.  Smaller projects (e.g. Aitik carbonatite in Sweden, Norra Kärr in Finland) are unlikely onstream by 2030.  Thus EU supply might reach only **hundreds** of tonnes NdPr/yr by 2030 (mostly from impurities and recycling).  
• **Japan:** No domestic mining; may develop a few processing/refining plants.  If Japanese industry repatriates more NdPr oxide for catalyst or magnet making, that may generate ~100s t/yr of refined NdPr products by 2030 (from imported feed).  
• **Recycling (Allies-wide):** Emerging “short-loop” recycle (magnet/industrial scrap) may contribute a few hundred tonnes NdPr/yr by 2030, but primary mining output dominates in this timeframe.

Imports dominated by China (~90%) ([www.ctvnews.ca](https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/first-of-its-kind-facility-hopes-to-launch-canada-into-rare-earths-market-1.7043486#:~:text=NdPr%20powers%20the%20strongest%20type,market%2C%20according%20to%20the%20SRC)).  
• Demand Benchmarks – IDTechEx (2024): global NdPr demand ~50,000 t in 2022 ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=Total%20global%20demand%20for%20NdPr,vehicles%20and%20automation%20more%20generally)); Chinese export curbs are spurring new projects. Neo Performance (Nov 2023) – 40 M EVs by 2035 → ~60,000 t magnets (≈18,000 t NdPr) ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/rare-earth-magnet-market-could-be-worth-5bn-outside-china/#:~:text=The%20number%20of%20EVs%20produced,5%20billion%20at%20current%20prices)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne or ground gamma-ray surveys identify Thorium/Uranium associated with monazite/bastnäsite.  Many carbonatite and ion-adsorption REE deposits were found this way.  (E.g. U-Th targets often pinpoint bastnäsite; Castor & Hedrick note Th mapping “used effectively” on carbonatites, though not all such deposits have Th signatures ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264647626_Rare_earth_minerals_and_the_geochemistry_and_implications_of_their_respective_uranium_and_thorium_contents#:~:text=used%20effectively%20to%20locate%20carbonatite,all%20deposits%20have%20been%20mapped)).)  
• **Geologic Mapping and Sampling:** Traditional mapping of carbonatites, alkaline intrusions, pegmatites and associated alteration zones is essential.  Geochemical prospecting (soil/rock/stream assays for Ce, La, Nd, Y anomalies) finds footprints of REE mineralization (as was done at Mt. Weld, etc.).  
• **Hyperspectral/Remote Sensing:** Airborne or satellite multispectral and hyperspectral sensors can detect Nd/Pr-bearing minerals’ absorption features.  For example, imaging spectrometers (HySpex, AVIRIS) have mapped Nd-enriched zones in carbonatites (Fen complex, Norway) by their reflectance spectra ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/5160#:~:text=method%20that%20uses%20a%20hyperspectral,Moreover)).  This non-invasive method helps prioritize targets.  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Airborne magnetics and gravity delineate dense carbonate bodies or igneous intrusions (common hosts of REE).  MT and seismic can image deep structures.  Electromagnetic surveys can highlight conductivity contrasts (e.g. clay-rich weathered zones).  Drill-testing these anomalies is critical.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Flotation & Physical Concentration:** Primary ore (bastnäsite, monazite) is ground and floated.  For example, Mountain Pass uses froth flotation to separate bastnäsite from gangue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136824000014/mp-20231231.htm#:~:text=facility,desired)).  Magnetic or electrostatic separators may further upgrade concentrates.  
• **Roasting and Leaching:** Monazite concentrates are often roasted (with NaOH or H₂SO₄) to release REEs and separate Th/U.  The roasted material is leached in acid to dissolve REEs, leaving radioelements behind.  For bastnäsite, direct acid leaching (sulfuric acid) or caustic cracking can digest the ore.  
• **Heap and In-Situ Leaching:** Low-grade ores (e.g. ion-adsorption clays) can be extracted by heap or in-situ leaching.  Mild acids or ammonium-salts percolate through ore bodies to strip Nd/Pr.  (Cobra Resources is testing in-situ recovery on an ionic-RE deposit, noting ISR as a “potential game-changer” ([www.edisongroup.com](https://www.edisongroup.com/research/exploring-a-potential-game-changer/33541/#:~:text=through%20in%20situ%20recovery%20%28ISR%29,Western%20producers%20are%20struggling%20with)).)  
• **Solvent Extraction – Pre-concentration:** Before SX, “pregnant lixiviant” may be pre-treated to remove impurities (e.g. iron coagulation).  Impurities (Fe, Al, Th) are precipitated, yielding a clean REE-bearing solution for extraction.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Multi-Stage Solvent Extraction:** The industry standard for separating Nd from Pr and other lanthanides.  Counter-current mixer-settler banks use extractants (e.g. D2EHPA/P204, PC-88A, Cyanex 272) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/2/269#:~:text=The%20solvent%20extraction%20process%20is,272%2C%20D2EHPA%2C%20PC88A%2C%20and%20Cyanex)) to first remove Ce/La, then split Nd vs Pr by slight pH adjustments.  Each batch yields purified Nd oxide and Pr oxide streams.  
• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:** Alternative to SX.  Continuous columns with chelating resins (or multi-zone fractionation) can isolate individual REEs.  Emerging technologies (e.g. ReElement’s proprietary chromatography process ([www.electricvehiclesresearch.com](https://www.electricvehiclesresearch.com/articles/31923/how-magnets-are-reshaping-rare-earth-supply-demand-and-recovery#:~:text=Long,magnets%20with%20reduced%20solvent%20usage))) recover Nd/Pr from secondary sources with minimal organic use.  
• **Selective Precipitation:** In some flowsheets, minor elements are precipitated out (e.g. HREE removal by oxalate or phosphate), simplifying downstream separation.  Fine-tuning pH can cause partial co-precipitation of lighter REEs to help separate Pr.  
• **Electrochemical Techniques:** Research into REDOX electrolysis or electrodialysis (using ionic complexing agents) for REE partitioning is underway, though not yet commercial for Nd/Pr.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Oxide Precipitation and Calcination:** Separated REE solutions are neutralized (often to pH 10–12) to precipitate mixed REE hydroxides/carbonates.  These are filtered and calcined to produce high-purity oxides (e.g. Pr₆O₁₁ or Pr₂O₃).  
• **Metallothermic Reduction:** Praseodymium oxide is reduced to metal via calcium or sodium reduction (Ca-thermal process) or via molten salt electrolysis (e.g. Claudet-cell style).  The resulting metallic Nd–Pr alloys are refined to 99.9%+ purity by vacuum distillation or zone melting.  
• **Powder Production (HDDR/SF):** Refined Nd–Pr alloy is hydrogenated and decrepitated (HDDR) or melt-spun then hydrogenated to produce fine NdFeB-grade alloy powder.  This powder is then sintered or bonded into magnets.  
• **Zone Refining/Electrorefining:** For highest-purity Nd/Pr (e.g. specialty magnets/lasers), methods like vacuum zone melting or ionic electrowinning may be used to remove residual impurities (Fe, Ni) from the metal.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Magnet Recycling (Short-Loop):** Recovery of Nd/Pr from end-of-life NdFeB magnets is an alternate “supply.”  Hydrogen-decrepitation and powder metallurgy can reconstitute magnets.  New approaches like ReElement’s chromatography recover dissolved Nd/Pr from scrap efficiently ([www.electricvehiclesresearch.com](https://www.electricvehiclesresearch.com/articles/31923/how-magnets-are-reshaping-rare-earth-supply-demand-and-recovery#:~:text=Long,magnets%20with%20reduced%20solvent%20usage)).  
• **Tailings Neutralization:** Acid leachates are neutralized (lime, caustic) to precipitate REEs and commons (Fe, Al) out of solution.  Sludges can be re-processed or safely disposed.  Gypsum or cementation can immobilize residual Th/U in the tailings.  
• **Phytoremediation:** Certain plants hyper-accumulate REEs and actinides.  For example, intercropping oats (Avena sativa) with lupins (Lupinus albus) has been shown to extract elevated levels of REEs and Th/U from monazite tailings ([www.techscience.com](https://www.techscience.com/jrm/v10n12/48822/html#:~:text=culture%20of%20Avena%20sativa%20L,thorium%20in)).  Reclaimed biomass must then be harvested and treated as secondary ore.  
• **Microbial Bioremediation:** Acid-producing bacteria (e.g. _Thiobacillus_ spp.) can bioleach REEs from low-grade waste or tailings, potentially recovering metals while detoxifying materials.  Fungi and bacteria that bind heavy metals are also under study for tailings cleanup.  
• **Closed-loop Processing:** Technologies to recycle reagents (recycle spent acids, regenerate SX organics) reduce waste.  Advanced effluent treatment (ion exchange columns, evaporators) ensures that no REEs or hazardous chemicals enter the environment.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is **limited domestic processing capacity**, especially Stage II separation and finishing.  While Mountain Pass can mine ~60,000 t/yr REO ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136824000014/mp-20231231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L3702%20grow%20our,next%20four%20years%20with%20modest)), its new separation plant output was only ~1,300 t NdPr oxide in 2024 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  Likewise, allied projects (Arafura, SRC, Solvay, etc.) are just coming online. Meeting demand by 2030 hinges on rapidly scaling SX/Ion-EX refineries and magnet plants. Without this, raw ore must continue flowing overseas.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Domestic NdPr production is constrained by processing throughput. For example, MP Materials’ Stage II separation only yielded ~1,300 t NdPr oxide in 2024 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) despite having 45,000 t of REO feed.  In short, **insufficient separation/refinement capacity** is the bottleneck – until more SX/IX trains and refining (NdPr metal and magnet) plants are built, allied production cannot scale to meet 2030 demand ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/solvay-launches-rare-earth-processing-expansion-amid-china-restrictions-2025-04-08/#:~:text=committing%20to%20a%20full,to%20reduce%20reliance%20on%20China)).
