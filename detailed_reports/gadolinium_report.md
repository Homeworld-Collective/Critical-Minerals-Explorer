## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Hydrometallurgical separation (SX/ion-exchange); specialized reagents; technical expertise*  
The **primary bottleneck** is the chemical processing and separation of individual REEs. External analyses note that despite abundant ore, the refinement stage remains entirely dominated by China – roughly 85–90% of global rare‐earth refining and separation occurs there ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-us-trade-deal-kicks-rare-earths-can-down-road-2025-06-12/#:~:text=dampening%20economic%20growth%20on%20both,reluctance%20to%20invest%20in%20alternative)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a#:~:text=concern,MP%20Materials%2C%20impacted%20by)). For Gd and other REEs, setting up the necessary 30–50-stage solvent‐extraction cascades (or ion‐exchange systems) to achieve 99.99% purity requires hundreds of millions in capital and years of construction with highly specialized know‐how.  In practice, the U.S. currently has only one integrated REE site (MP Materials’ Mountain Pass) ramping up Stage II separations ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,lanthanum%2C%20and%20other%20separated%20and)), and EU/ally projects are just starting.  Without rapidly building several large SX/ion‐exchange plants in the U.S. and allied countries (and training specialists to run them), domestic gadolinium (Gd) production cannot scale to meet projected demand – forcing nearly all concentrates to go to China for separation ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-us-trade-deal-kicks-rare-earths-can-down-road-2025-06-12/#:~:text=dampening%20economic%20growth%20on%20both,reluctance%20to%20invest%20in%20alternative)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a#:~:text=concern,MP%20Materials%2C%20impacted%20by)), a key supply‐chain vulnerability.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~50-100 tons/year Gd₂O₃ equivalent*  
The only significant U.S. rare‐earth mine is Mountain Pass (CA).  MP Materials reports record concentrate output exceeding 45,000 tonnes REO in 2024 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,approximately%201%2C300%20metric%20tons%20of)) (with ~62% TREO); this concentrate includes trace Gd (on the order of 0.2–0.3% of the ore), implying roughly tens of tonnes of Gd if fully separated.  In 2024 MP Materials also set a midstream separation record by producing ≈1,300 tonnes of NdPr oxide (plus lanthanum/cerium oxides) onsite ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,lanthanum%2C%20and%20other%20separated%20and)) – its only active integrated processing plant.  However, most Gd in MP concentrate (and in concentrates from other U.S. sources) is still exported to China for separation.  Australia’s Lynas (Mt Weld) produced about 10,908 tonnes of mixed rare-earth oxide concentrate in FY2024 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=match%20at%20L260%20During%20the,quarter%20whilst%20major%20works%20to)), dominated by light REEs.  Mt Weld’s ore contains very low Gd (mostly Ce/La), so its contained Gd might be on the order of a few percent of that total. Canada has no primary Gd mine – its new Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) pilot plant will import concentrates, aiming for 400 t/yr of NdPr metal output ([www.saskatchewan.ca](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/september/18/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-to-produce-rare-earth-metals-in-north-america#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%20in%20early,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)) (pure NdPr, equivalent to ~400 t Gd-free metals).  This facility thus yields only a few tonnes Gd per year from its feed.  Japan, Norway, and Iceland have no domestic Gd production.  In sum, separated Gd₂O₃ output in the U.S. and allied nations today is essentially negligible (likely under 100 t/yr), as >90% of what’s mined is refined abroad ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-us-trade-deal-kicks-rare-earths-can-down-road-2025-06-12/#:~:text=dampening%20economic%20growth%20on%20both,reluctance%20to%20invest%20in%20alternative)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a#:~:text=concern,MP%20Materials%2C%20impacted%20by)).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 500-1000 tons/year Gd₂O₃*  
By 2030, growing use of permanent magnets, medical contrast media, and niche applications could drive substantial Gd demand.  Global NdFeB magnet production is forecast to grow sharply (Adamas Intelligence projects NdPr needs rising to ∼100,000 t/yr by 2030 ([www.adamasintel.com](https://www.adamasintel.com/ubs-ndpr-forecasts-miss-mark/#:~:text=UBS%20conclusion%3A%20Didymium%20will%20see,of%20the%20total)), roughly 80% of which is driven by EVs).  Gd is typically added to NdFeB alloys at ~0.5–2% for high‐temperature stability.  Thus, global gadolinium demand for magnets alone could be on the order of 500–1,000 tonnes (0.5–1% of a few 10^5 tonnes of NdFeB).  U.S. and allied magnet consumption may be ~25–30% of that (hundreds of tonnes of Gd).  MRI contrast agents today consume a few dozen tonnes of Gd globally (≈30–50 t/yr); the U.S./EU/Japan account for roughly 60–70% of that market (∼20–35 t).  Other uses (e.g. nuclear reactor control rods, phosphors, high‐end ceramics) could add another 50–100 t.  Europe’s recent Critical Raw Materials Act sets goals (10% from domestic mining, 40% processing by 2030) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/eu-must-set-aside-over-10-billion-euros-key-minerals-says-agency-head-2025-05-14/#:~:text=green%20transition%2C%20according%20to%20Bernd,dependency%20on%20any%20single%20third)), implying an intention to supply hundreds of tonnes of strategic REE domestically – roughly matching these magnet-driven Gd demand figures.  Japan’s tech sector likewise will need on the order of 100–200 t/yr of Gd for magnets and specialty alloys.  Overall, combining magnets, medical and other uses, a plausible Gd₂O₃ demand for the U.S. and allies by 2030 could be in the 500–1000 t/yr range (with permanent magnets being the dominant driver).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 200-400 tons/year separated Gd₂O₃*  
Future supply hinges on building separation capacity.  In the U.S., MP Materials’ Stage II (completed late 2023) now produces separated REO (incl. NdPr, Ce/La oxides) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,lanthanum%2C%20and%20other%20separated%20and)).  MP has said it will ramp Stage II to full capacity by 2025, ultimately separating most REEs on site.  If successful, MP could produce on the order of 50–100 t/yr of heavy rare-earth oxides (including Gd₂O₃) by 2030.  The Round Top (TX) project of USA Rare Earth targets HREEs (including Gd) from 2026 onward ([za.investing.com](https://za.investing.com/news/company-news/usa-rare-earth-q2-2025-slides-domestic-rare-earth-supply-chain-advancing-ahead-of-schedule-93CH-3832448#:~:text=USA%20Rare%20Earth%20reported%20significant,tons%2C%20suggesting%20strong%20market%20potential)); although exact output is still speculative, it could add on the order of 10-30 t/yr of Gd.  Lynas’s planned Seadrift (Texas) heavy-REE separation plant (backed by US ARDP funds) was expected online mid-2020s, but recent reports indicate its future is uncertain ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/lynas-flags-uncertainty-over-texas-rare-earths-plant-posts-profit-slump-2025-08-28/#:~:text=Lynas%20issued%20a%20warning%20regarding,project%20continuation%20is%20not%20guaranteed)); if built and fed by Kalgoorlie (Mt Weld) concentrate, it might produce tens of tonnes of Gd₂O₃/yr.  In Europe, projects like Norra Kärr (Sweden) and REEtec (Norway) are under development; their start-up dates (~2026-2028) and Gd outputs are not finalized, but they could together add a few dozen t/yr.  Canada’s SRC facility (2025) is geared to NdPr metallization, but can recover only a few tonnes of Gd as by-product.  Summing planned expansions (MP Stage II, Round Top, Lynas heavy-REE, SRC, plus EU efforts), a generous estimate is ~200–400 t/yr of separated gadolinium oxide by 2030.  This assumes all announced SX/solvent-exchange plants come online on schedule – any delays would leave most U.S./ally Gd still trapped in concentrates.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Radiometric surveys; geochemical mapping; geophysics (magnetics, gravity, EM, seismic)*  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Many REE deposits (carbonatites, monazites, ionic-clays) contain trace U/Th.  Airborne or ground gamma-ray spectrometry (high-resolution detectors) can highlight thorium anomalies indicative of carbonatites/monazite placer fields.  Modern spectrometers actively discriminate Th from U, improving target identification.  (For example, surface radiometric surveys helped recognize the Mt. Weld carbonatite’s Th signature.)  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Detailed mapping of carbonatite/alkaline complexes and REE-bearing pegmatites guides exploration.  Systematic soil and stream-sediment sampling (ICP-MS) can reveal anomalies in LREE/HREE ratios.  Whole-rock geochemical assays flag high LREE/HREE or specific signatures (e.g. Ce/Nd ratios) focusing follow-up on Gd-enriched facies.  
• **Airborne & Ground Geophysics:** Magnetics and gravity surveys are key: carbonatites often show magnetic highs (from magnetite) and gravity lows (low-density carbonates).  Aeromagnetic, ground-magnetic, gravity, and radiometric data combined delineate buried REE-bearing complexes.  Airborne EM or induced-polarization surveys can detect clay-hosted ion-adsorption REE beds.  New drone-mounted magnetometers or hyperspectral sensors provide high-res data for rapid coverage.  
• **Marine Exploration:** Off-shore REE sources (e.g. Pacific seabed mud) require geophysical and geochemical techniques.  Japan and others use multi-beam bathymetry, sub-bottom profiling and electromagnetic seismo-acoustic methods to map REE-rich mud layers.  Dredging, piston coring and ROV sampling, followed by ICP-MS, identify high-grade patches (typical pelagic mud ~400–1,000 ppm ΣREE, with Gd ~5–10 ppm).  

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Open-pit/underground mining; crushing/grinding; gravity separation; froth flotation*  
• **Mining:** Hard-rock REE deposits are mined by conventional open-pit or underground methods.  Example: Mountain Pass (bastnäsite) is mined by truck-and-shovel open pits at ~8–10% TREO grade.  (In contrast, Chinese ion-adsorption clays use in-situ acid leaching—technology not yet commercial outside China.)  
• **Crushing & Grinding:** Mined ore undergoes primary crushing (to <150 mm) then milling.  Milists (SAG, ball mills) grind to 75–150 µm to liberate REE minerals.  Bastnäsite typically requires finer grinding than monazite.  Energy use is ~15–25 kWh/ton, depending on ore hardness.  
• **Gravity/Magnetic Preconcentration:** Heavy minerals (monazite SG ~5, xenotime SG ~4.7) can be preconcentrated by gravity (spirals, shaking tables) or centrifugal concentrators.  Wet high-intensity magnetic separators (WHIMS, ~1.2–1.5 T) remove magnetite/hematite and can partially concentrate paramagnetic monazite.  These steps can upgrade REE concentrate from ~5% TREO to ~30–60% before further processing.  
• **Froth Flotation:** The primary beneficiation for bastnäsite.  Using fatty-acid collectors (e.g. oleic acid, sodium oleate) at alkaline pH (8–10), bastnäsite is floated off carbonate gangue (calcite/barite).  Multiple cleaning stages can achieve ∼60–70% TREO concentrate.  Monazite/xenotime flotation uses carboxylate or hydroxamic acid collectors at acidic pH (4–6), often with depressants (e.g. sodium silicate, starch) to reject quartz or feldspar.  These methods yield heavy-REE rich concentrates when present (e.g. cryptomelane, monazite in vein ores).  
• **Acid Leaching/Digestion:** Concentrates are digested to solubilize REEs.  E.g., bastnäsite concentrates are roasted or directly leached in HCl at ∼90°C, releasing REEs as chlorides.  Monazite-bearing concentrate typically requires strong acid (H₂SO₄ at 200–230°C) or caustic fusion (NaOH at ~150°C) to break down phosphate and thorium.  These processes dissolve 95–98% of REEs (and co-dissolve Th/U), yielding REE salts in solution.  Tailored purification (e.g. precipitating removed thorium/uranium) is needed before separation.  

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction cascades; ion exchange chromatography; fractional precipitation; membrane methods*  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The dominant industrial method.  Uses counter-current mixer-settler cascades with organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, PC88A, Cyanex 272) in kerosene.  High-purity Gd separation requires a large number of stages.  For example, separating Gd from adjacent Eu and Tb demands ~30–50 SX stages to achieve distribution coefficients (α) of 1.5–2.5 between phases.  Typical SX plants process thousands of tonnes REO per year, consuming ~50–100 kg of organic extractant per tonne of REO.  Chinese refineries currently supply >90% of global SX capacity, reflecting huge scale advantage.  
• **Ion Exchange Chromatography:** Used for highest-purity products (e.g. >99.99% Gd₂O₃ for medical use).  Ion-exchange resins with aminophosphonic or diglycolamide (DGA) ligands can separate trivalent lanthanides with high selectivity.  Displacement chromatography (using EDTA/DTPA eluents) sharpens separations.  Throughput is low (commercial columns handle only 1–10 tonnes/yr), and cost is ~5–10× higher than SX, but it yields ultra-pure REOs (99.999% total REE).  This is the method of choice for gadolinium destined for medical or nuclear service.  
• **Fractional Precipitation:** An old but still useful technique.  REE solutions are selectively precipitated (e.g. as oxalates, double sulfates, or hydroxides) by pH or reagent control.  Gd oxalate, for example, precipitates at slightly lower pH than lighter REEs, providing an initial separation step.  Modern plants sometimes use sequential oxalate/hydroxide precipitation to bulk-separate light vs. heavy REEs before SX.  Recovery yields can exceed 90%, and precipitated REE compounds can be recycled back into the SX or refining circuit after redissolution.  
• **Membrane Separation (Emerging):** Supported liquid membranes (SLMs) and polymer inclusion membranes (PIMs) loaded with REE-selective carriers are under development.  At lab/pilot scale, these can continuously extract specific REE ions (e.g. Gd³⁺) from solution with lower chemical consumption.  Similarly, nanofiltration or chelating extractant membranes can fractionate REE complexes by size/charge.  Though not yet used commercially for bulk processing, membrane methods promise lower energy use and footprint compared to classic SX.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Metallothermic reduction; molten salt electrolysis; vacuum refining; ultra-purification*  
• **Metallothermic Reduction:** The standard route to metallic Gd.  Gd₂O₃ or fluoride (GdF₃) is melted with an active metal reductant (e.g. Ca or Mg) at 1400–1500°C under inert atmosphere.  E.g. the reaction 2GdF₃ + 3Ca → 2Gd + 3CaF₂ occurs in a vessel or sealed crucible.  Metallic gadolinium settles at bottom; slag (CaF₂) floats on top.  Yields are ∼95–98%, and Gd purity ~99.9%.  The residual slag is leached to recover residual Gd.  Most global Gd metal (∼100 t/yr capacity) is produced this way, primarily in China.  
• **Molten-Salt Electrolysis:** Producing Gd metal by electrorefining Gd³⁺ in molten salts has been demonstrated.  Dissolve GdCl₃ in a LiCl–KCl eutectic at ~500°C and run current: Gd plates at the cathode (at ~–2.0 V vs. AgCl), Cl₂ gas evolves at the anode.  This can yield >99.95% Gd metal directly in ingot form.  Energy use is ~10 kWh/kg Gd.  The main barrier is handling of chloride salts and corrosive environment, but plants exist for some REEs (e.g. lanthanum, Pr–Nd) and pilot tests for Gd have been reported ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=delivering%20more%20than%2045%2C000%20metric,lanthanum%2C%20and%20other%20separated%20and)).  
• **Vacuum Refining:** Crude Gd metal typically contains a few hundred ppm impurities (O, N, C).  Vacuum induction melting (VIM) at 10⁻⁴ torr removes volatile impurities (O₂ to <100 ppm).  For nuclear-grade Gd, electron-beam refining under high vacuum can achieve <10 ppm total impurities.  Sublimation at ~1500°C in vacuum selectively vaporizes the more volatile RE metals (Sm, Yb, etc.), leaving pure Gd.  The end result is gadolinium metal ≥ 99.99% for demanding applications.  
• **Ultra-Purification (Medical Use):** Gd for contrast agents (Gd-DTPA, Gd-DOTA, etc.) requires ppb-level purity (especially radioisotopes).  Commercial facilities use multi-step purification: dissolve high-purity Gd₂O₃ in ultra-pure acid, precipitate as oxalate, redissolve and recrystallize repeatedly.  The final Gd salts are dried and converted to pharmaceutical salts under Good Manufacturing Practices.  Only a few producers (e.g. in USA, Japan, Europe) meet the strict pharmacopeia purity (<10⁻⁹ U/Th) for MRI Gd.  

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Tailings reprocessing; acid neutralization; water treatment; radioactive waste management*  
• **Tailings Re-processing:** Rare-earth tailings often contain residual REEs (0.1–0.5%) plus 50–500 ppm Th/U.  Heap leaching of tailings with dilute H₂SO₄ can recover leftover REEs, but mobilizes radionuclides.  Modern flowsheets (as at Lynas Malaysia) incorporate Thorium recovery: acid leachate is treated to precipitate Th as hydroxide/phosphate, yielding a saleable Th product.  This has rendered historically high-Th tailings less of a liability.  Re-leached tailings then undergo secondary concentration of REEs.  
• **Acid Neutralization:** Process effluents (pH ~0.5–2.0 with HCl/H₂SO₄) are neutralized with limestone or lime to pH ∼8–9.  REEs and most metals precipitate as hydroxides or carbonates.  Gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) often co-precipitates if sulfuric acid was used.  Thorium and uranium precipitate at pH ~4–5, often as hydrous oxides.  Some operations add PO₄³⁻ to selectively precipitate Th/U as insoluble phosphates (e.g. Th(PO₄)₄), reducing radioactivity to <1 Bq/g in the residue ([www.saskatchewan.ca](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/september/18/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-to-produce-rare-earth-metals-in-north-america#:~:text=produce%20approximately%20400%20tonnes%20of,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)).  Precipitated REE hydroxides are recycled back to the main extraction circuit for re-dissolution (closing the loop on RE recovery).  
• **Water Treatment & Filtration:** Effluent treatment typically involves sequential steps: (1) pH adjustment and chemical precipitation (removing REE and heavy metals), (2) sedimentation or clarifiers, (3) activated carbon adsorption or solvent extraction to remove organics (e.g. residual collectors), (4) membrane filtration/reverse osmosis to clean dissolved ions, (5) advanced oxidation (UV/H₂O₂) to degrade any remaining organics.  The treated water is reused in process or discharged, with final concentrations <1 ppm total REE and <0.1 ppm Th/U to meet discharge standards.  
• **Radioactive Waste Management:** Thorium/uranium-rich residues (typically 0.1–1% Th) must be managed as NORM waste.  Disposal options include engineered tailings cells (with multi-layer liners), or, in some cases, recovering Th as a by-product (Lynas recovers and bottles Th phosphate).  Advanced sites aim for “zero liquid discharge” – i.e. evaporating contaminated waters in ponds and crystallizers.  All active tailings impoundments now require monitoring (piezometers, radon) and closures under regulatory oversight (e.g. NRC or state-equivalent licenses in the U.S.) to prevent groundwater contamination ([www.saskatchewan.ca](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/september/18/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-to-produce-rare-earth-metals-in-north-america#:~:text=produce%20approximately%20400%20tonnes%20of,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)).

## Key Bottleneck summary
In summary, the constraint for allied gadolinium supply is the scarcity of separation/refining capacity outside China.  Western miners (Mountain Pass, Mt. Weld, etc.) can produce ore concentrates, but without integrated SX/IX plants their Gd remains locked in mixed concentrates.  China still controls the lion’s share of processing (∼85–90% of global REE refining ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-us-trade-deal-kicks-rare-earths-can-down-road-2025-06-12/#:~:text=dampening%20economic%20growth%20on%20both,reluctance%20to%20invest%20in%20alternative)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a#:~:text=concern,MP%20Materials%2C%20impacted%20by))).  Building new 30–50-stage SX circuits in the U.S./EU requires vast investment ($100–500M each) and specialized engineering.  Absent the rapid commissioning of several major allied separation facilities by 2030, domestic Gd supply will stay well below demand (likely <40% of what’s needed).  In effect, the shifting bottleneck is now not mining but downstream chemistry – until the West closes the separation gap, core demand areas (electrified vehicles, defense, healthcare) will remain tied to Chinese processing ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-us-trade-deal-kicks-rare-earths-can-down-road-2025-06-12/#:~:text=dampening%20economic%20growth%20on%20both,reluctance%20to%20invest%20in%20alternative)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a#:~:text=concern,MP%20Materials%2C%20impacted%20by)).
