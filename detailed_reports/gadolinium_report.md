## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
The United States currently has only one active rare‐earth mine (Mountain Pass, CA, operated by MP Materials); it is often cited as supplying roughly “tens of thousands” of tonnes of mixed rare‐earth oxide per year.  In practice, U.S. production is entirely from Mountain Pass (bastnäsite), so essentially all domestic Gd comes from this one site ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=The%20U,to%20catalyze%20the%20development%20of)).  In contrast, allied nations with current REE output are limited. Australia’s Lynas (Mt Weld) – the world’s largest non‐China producer – reported ~3,212 t of total rare‐earth product in Q4 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lynas-sees-higher-rare-earths-prices-after-us-backs-mp-materials-2025-07-24/#:~:text=mid,Collaborating%20with%20South%20Korea%27s%20JS)) (implying on the order of 10–12 kt/year if sustained).  Canada has no primary Gd mine; its new Saskatchewan SRC plant is a processor of imported ore (targeting ~40 t/month total RE metals ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/miner-backed-by-canada-province-vows-compete-with-china-rare-earths-2024-09-23/#:~:text=create%20market%20uncertainties,sufficient%20for%20500%2C000%20electric%20vehicles)), but no domestic ore).  Nor do Japan, Norway or Iceland have any Gd mining – they are 100% import‐reliant today. (For reference, the only EU project nearing production is Sweden’s Norra Karr, which could yield ~5,340 t rare‐earth oxides/year when built ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)), but it is not yet online.)  Thus current US/allied Gd output is effectively just U.S. plus Australian concentrate: roughly 27–34 kt/yr combined (the US ~27.4 kt and Australia ~12 kt by our estimate), with all other allied production negligible ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lynas-sees-higher-rare-earths-prices-after-us-backs-mp-materials-2025-07-24/#:~:text=mid,Collaborating%20with%20South%20Korea%27s%20JS)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=The%20U,to%20catalyze%20the%20development%20of)).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Projected Gadolinium demand in the U.S. and allied economies by 2030 depends on growth in magnets, electronics, medical, and defense uses.  For example, Western EV and wind‐turbine policies imply magnet markets roughly doubling.  Industry forecasts put global NdPr magnet demand at ~75–98 kt by 2030 ([www.businesschemistry.org](https://www.businesschemistry.org/article/joint-product-analysis-of-rare-earths-economic-market-and-technological-insights/#:~:text=Joint%20Product%20Analysis%20of%20Rare,The%20whole%20NdPr%20market)).  If heavy‐REE (including Gd) scale similarly (even at ~5–10% of NdPr mass in specialized high‐temp magnets), then U.S./allies could need on the order of 2–5 kt/yr of Gd by 2030.  Europe’s CRMA aims to source ~20–30% of its REE magnet needs by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)), and Solvay’s La Rochelle plant targets ~20–30% of EU demand for permanent‐magnet REEs by 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)), implying multi‐kiloton REE use.  Meanwhile, Japan explicitly targets domestic Gd (and Dy) via deep‐sea mining ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japan-begin-test-mining-rare-earth-mud-seabed-early-2026-2025-07-04/#:~:text=is%20believed%20to%20contain%20valuable,metric%20tons%20is%20planned%20for)).  In addition, stable demand comes from MRI contrast agents and nuclear control rods (tens to hundreds of tonnes per year across the alliance).  Thus a plausible 2030 demand range is a few thousand tonnes per year of Gd for US+allies combined, dominated by magnet/additive manufacturing growth (NdFeB magnets use), medical imaging, and specialty electronics ([www.businesschemistry.org](https://www.businesschemistry.org/article/joint-product-analysis-of-rare-earths-economic-market-and-technological-insights/#:~:text=Joint%20Product%20Analysis%20of%20Rare,The%20whole%20NdPr%20market)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Domestic supply in 2030 will come from expanded existing mines and new projects in the US/allies.  In the US, production will include Mountain Pass (likely steady ~27–30 kt) plus new outputs like the WY Brook coal/REE mine (starting ~2027 ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e4a3eff0b20039491df2dac99fa8ef0f#:~:text=of%20a%20%24533%20million%20initiative,for%20Wyoming%E2%80%99s%20coal%20industry%20amidst)), though its Gd yield is unknown) and any new REE discoveries.  Australia’s Lynas plans further expansion; it delivered ~3,212 t in Q4 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lynas-sees-higher-rare-earths-prices-after-us-backs-mp-materials-2025-07-24/#:~:text=mid,Collaborating%20with%20South%20Korea%27s%20JS)) and is expanding refining (including a heavy‐REE plant RTL in Texas).  EU projects also emerge: e.g. Norra Karr (Sweden) targets 5,340 t/year of oxides ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)) and Fen (Norway) ~2,000 t by 2031.  Canada’s SRC facility (processing imports) will only modestly add metals (40 t/month or ~480 t/yr REEs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/miner-backed-by-canada-province-vows-compete-with-china-rare-earths-2024-09-23/#:~:text=create%20market%20uncertainties,sufficient%20for%20500%2C000%20electric%20vehicles))).  Summing mature projects, US/allied domestic Gd‐containing supply could reach on order 30,000–50,000 t/year by 2030.  This includes ~30–35 kt U.S./Aus production plus a few kt from new EU/Canada projects. These estimates use disclosed project targets ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/miner-backed-by-canada-province-vows-compete-with-china-rare-earths-2024-09-23/#:~:text=create%20market%20uncertainties,sufficient%20for%20500%2C000%20electric%20vehicles)) and assume continued scale‐up; actual output will depend on investment and permitting.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Because many REE ores (carbonatites, monazites) contain trace U/Th, airborne or ground gamma‐ray spectrometry can highlight anomalies.  High Th spots often led explorers to REE-rich carbonatites (e.g. early Queensland/Africa explorations).  This technique has aided discovery of REE deposits historically.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Surface mapping of carbonatite/alkaline intrusions, pegmatites, or heavy‐mineral placers focuses follow-up.  Systematic soil and stream sediment sampling (ICP‐MS or XRF) can detect enrichment in Ce, Nd, Gd etc., indicating a REE‐bearing system.  Fractional crystallization geochemistry (e.g. high Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf anomalies) also guides targeting of magma‐hosted REE.  
• **Airborne & Ground Geophysics:** Magnetic and gravity surveys can identify carbonatite bodies or dense mineral zones (carbonatites often have distinct magnetic lows/highs).  Electromagnetic and radiometric surveys may delineate clay‐hosted REE or thorium anomalies.  Borehole downhole logging (gamma and susceptibility) refines targets.  
• **Marine Geophysical Exploration:** For offshore Gd sources, advanced marine methods apply. Japan’s Minamitori project uses deep-sea ROV drilling and core sampling guided by seismic mapping to locate REE-rich mud layers ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/japan-begin-test-mining-rare-earth-mud-seabed-early-2026-2025-07-04/#:~:text=is%20believed%20to%20contain%20valuable,metric%20tons%20is%20planned%20for)).  Submersible surveys (sonar/grav) and geochemical analysis of dredged mud help discover submarine REE deposits containing Gd/Tb/Dy.

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit/Underground Mining:** Hard-rock REE deposits (carbonate or ionic clay) are mined by conventional methods.  At Mountain Pass (bastnäsite, open pit) and future sites, drill/blast followed by haulage yields run‐of‐mine ore.  Wyoming’s Brook coal‐REE project will mine coal seams that also contain heavy REEs ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e4a3eff0b20039491df2dac99fa8ef0f#:~:text=of%20a%20%24533%20million%20initiative,for%20Wyoming%E2%80%99s%20coal%20industry%20amidst)).  
• **Crushing & Grinding:** Extracted ore is milled to fine size.  Multi-stage grinding (rod/ball mills) liberates REE minerals from gangue.  Magnetite, monazite or xenotime grains are freed for separation.  
• **Gravity and Magnetic Separation:** Dense heavy minerals (e.g. monazite, xenotime, magnetite) can be pre-concentrated by gravity tables or spirals, and magnetic separators (permanent or Eddy-current) remove magnetic gangue.  This produces a coarse REE‐rich concentrate ahead of chemical processing.  
• **Froth Flotation:** The predominant concentration method.  In bastnäsite/quartz ores, collectors (e.g. pine oil, kerosene) float REE carbonates away from silica.  Flotation circuits with pH control yield ~60–70% rare-earth oxide concentrate ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Extracted%20ore%20from%20mines%20is,these%20can%20generate%20toxic%20byproducts)) from raw ore.  (Some deposits require pre‐treatment; e.g. roasting or acid leaching to break down refractory minerals like monazite, as noted by Reuters ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Extracted%20ore%20from%20mines%20is,these%20can%20generate%20toxic%20byproducts)).)  
• **Leaching/Acid Dissolution:** Concentrates are treated with strong acids (HCl, H₂SO₄) or sometimes alkali to dissolve REEs.  For example, bastnäsite concentrate is often digested in sulfuric or hydrochloric acid to form REE chlorides.  Monazite may require alkali roast followed by water leach. These steps convert REEs into soluble compounds for separation.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Multi-stage liquid‐liquid extraction systems use organic reagents (e.g. di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid, Cyanex 272, tributyl phosphate) to partition Gd^3+ from other REEs.  By carefully controlling pH and chelator type, Gd can be sequentially stripped.  Reuters notes this “most challenging” separation phase is done via ion‐exchange or solvent methods ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=like%20thorium%20or%20uranium,For%20magnet)). Industrial SX cascades (e.g. at Lynas, Solvay) produce individual lanthanide oxides, but require large reagent volumes and generate secondary waste ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=like%20thorium%20or%20uranium,For%20magnet)).  
• **Ion Exchange Chromatography:** Chelating resins (e.g. iminodiacetate, sulfonic/salt form resins) can fractionate REEs on laboratory or small commercial scale.  For example, patent US6093376A demonstrates separating Tm–Gd–Y mixtures via stepwise elution ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6093376A/en#:~:text=,as%20much%20retaining%20ion)). In that case, equal‐molar Tm, Gd, Y feed was passed through a sulfonic resin (with Yb holdback) and an iminodiacetic resin; by adjusting eluants, Gd (and Tm) were isolated.  In practice, ion‐exchange is used for ultra‐high purity and small batches (e.g. nuclear‐grade Gd).  
• **Magnetic Susceptibility Separation:** Some novel methods exploit magnetic differences.  Gadolinium has unique magnetic behavior (becomes ferromagnetic at cryogenic T) and can be separated from neighbors by strong magnets.  Geomega (Canada) demonstrated a flow-channel separator where an intermediate‐strength magnet drew off Gd+Tm entrained particles ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=has%20an%20intermediate%20strength%20generating,channel%20100%20into%20output%20channel)).  They then electrochemically reduce Tm^3+ to Tm^2+ (increasing its magnetic susceptibility), allowing Gd and Tm to be separated magnetically ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=%2A%20For%20separating%20Gadolinium,and%20separation%20can%20be%20made)).  Such cryogenic/magnet methods are experimental but can refine Gd from adjacent REEs.  
• **Selective Precipitation/Crystallization:** Chemical precipitation can coarsely fractionate REEs. For example, adjusting pH or precipitant (oxalate, carbonate) can first remove Ce or La, enriching heavier lanthanides. Gd(OH)_3 or oxalate has a slightly different solubility/pKa than its neighbors, allowing stepwise recovery. This is often used after SX: e.g., converting purified Gd chloride to high‐purity Gd_2O_3 via oxalate precipitation then calcination. (Citations: General REE practice.)

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metallothermic (Kroll) Reduction:** The canonical method for Gd metal.  After isolating Gd oxide or chloride, it is mixed with molten Ca or Mg at ~1,300–1,450 °C.  Spedding’s 1950s patent showed that heating a GdCl_3/Ca mixture to ~1,375–1,500 °C selectively reduces Gd^3+ to metal ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2714554A/en#:~:text=gadolinium%20oxide%20and%20at%20least,chlorides%20by%20dissolving%20in%20water)).  Experiments yielded ~96% of the theoretical Gd (e.g. 23.8 g from 24.8 g charge) with >99.94% purity (Sm contamination <0.06%) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2714554A/en#:~:text=converted%20with%20hydrochloric%20acid%20to,the%20limit%20of%20detection)).  The calcium (or magnesium) slag is leached away, leaving sponge Gd which can be vacuum melted into ingots. This “Kroll process” is the industrial norm for pure Gd metal.  
• **Molten‐Salt Electrolysis:** An alternative reduction method. Gd compounds (often chlorides) are dissolved in a molten salt electrolyte (e.g. LiCl–KCl) and electrochemically reduced at a cathode.  As Reuters notes, “separated oxides are then converted into metals by electrolysis” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Separated%20oxides%20are%20then%20converted,significant%20challenges%20in%20boosting%20domestic)).  In practice, one can electrolyze GdCl_3 to deposit Gd metal (or even co‐deposit with Fe for Gd–Fe alloys as in some patents) under an inert atmosphere.  Molten‐salt cells are proven for other REEs (Nd, Yb) and can yield very high‐purity Gd without consumable reductant (only electricity).  
• **Vacuum Refining & Alloying:** Crude Gd metal (usually >99%) is further purified by vacuum melting (induction or electron‐beam) to remove residual hydrogen or impurities.  For magnets, Gd is typically alloyed: e.g. added to Nd–Fe–B melts to improve grain structure or temperature stability.  Alloys (e.g. GdCo_5, or Gd-doped NdFeB) are cast, milled, and sintered to make magnet powders. Subsequent heat treatments and anneals complete magnet production.  
• **Chemical Factories:** For contrast agents, Gd oxide or nitrate is converted to gadolinium chelates (e.g. Gd-DTPA) under pharmaceutical GMP.  These require ultra‐clean, radioactive‐free feedstocks.  Specialized solvent‐crystallization and purification trains remove trace Eu/Th to meet medical specs. (Examples: Danish Gedeon Richter’s or BEA’s purification lines for MRI‐grade Gd.)  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Re-processing:** REE mining generates radioactive/co‐contaminant waste (thorium, uranium, heavy metals). A key remediation approach is revisiting tailings to recover residual Gd and extract toxics.  For instance, Lynas’s Malaysia facility obtained permission by proposing to **extract thorium** from spent leach residue ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/6a3eed870d912de680b1b2eec857157b#:~:text=The%20Malaysian%20government%20has%20granted,to%20research%20and%20development%2C%20particularly)), effectively turning hazardous waste into saleable Ra/Th.  Similarly, the U.S. Interior is promoting recovery of REEs from mining waste – e.g. acid‐leaching coal-ash/coal refuse to remove residual REEs (including Gd) and segregate heavy metals ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/us-prioritizes-recovery-critical-minerals-mine-waste-2025-07-24/#:~:text=The%20policy%20is%20designed%20to,reliance%20on%20foreign%20mineral%20sources)). This both provides extra ore and mitigates environmental liabilities.  
• **Acid Neutralization & Precipitation:** Processing effluents contain strong acids and dissolved ions. A standard remediation step is neutralizing spent acids (e.g. with lime or limestone) to pH>8, precipitating sulfates and hydroxides of REEs and metals.  Precipitated sludge (REE oxyhydroxides or carbonates) can be recycled back into processing, while toxic elements (e.g. Th U) are co-precipitated for secure disposal. High-end operations may use ion-exchange columns or solvent scrubbing (e.g. TEVA resin) specifically to remove radiotoxic species before discharge.  
• **Water Treatment & Filtration:** Spent waters are treated with advanced filtration (e.g. nanofiltration, reverse osmosis) and chemical oxidation (to remove organic solvents) before release.  These capture trace REEs, normalize pH, and remove chemical reagents.  In-lake/river remediation might involve oxygenation and wetland buffering to sequester any mobile metals.  
• **Regulatory Monitoring & Recycling:** Cleanup also includes monitoring for radioactivity and heavy metals. Closed-loop strategies (e.g. solvent recycling to minimize fresh chemical use) reduce waste generation. Additionally, recycling of Gd from end‐use (e.g. MRI agents or spent magnets) lessens environmental impact: Japan and the EU are developing recycling schemes to recover >50% of REEs, including Gd, from scrapped electronics and industrial waste.

• **Metal Production:** Classic patents (Spedding 1955) detail Ca/Mg reduction of GdCl_3 to metal ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2714554A/en#:~:text=gadolinium%20oxide%20and%20at%20least,chlorides%20by%20dissolving%20in%20water)) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US2714554A/en#:~:text=converted%20with%20hydrochloric%20acid%20to,the%20limit%20of%20detection)), achieving >99.9% purity. Molten-salt electrolysis patents (CN101200806A, etc.) describe direct Gd metal deposition from chloride melts. These sources underpin the numbers and methods cited.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Hydrometallurgical Processing (SX/Ion-Exchange):** The chief bottleneck is refining Gd to pure form.  Building large-scale solvent-extraction or ion-exchange plants is capital-intensive and scarce outside China. Reporters note the “most challenging phase” of REE production is multi-stage SX/column separation ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Extracted%20ore%20from%20mines%20is,these%20can%20generate%20toxic%20byproducts)). The U.S. currently has only one REE mine ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=The%20U,to%20catalyze%20the%20development%20of)), and allied projects are nascent (e.g. Lynas’s Texas heavy-REE plant, Solvay France, REEtec Norway) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/western-rare-earths-supply-chain-springs-into-gear-2024-06-17/#:~:text=,building%20its%20refinery%20with%20government)). Meanwhile the EU targets only ~45% domestic REE separation by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20set%20ambitious,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by)). In short, without a mature indigenous chemical-processing industry obtaining Gd, allied supply remains constrained.  
• **Rare-Earth Magnetization:** (Optional) Downstream magnet manufacturing is also a bottleneck: few facilities exist outside Asia. For example, U.S. aims to produce 10,000 t/yr of NdPr magnet alloys ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=gain%20a%2015,Analysts%20expect%20the%20pricing)), but heavy Gd-containing magnets especially demand specialized manufacturing (e.g. coercivity doping), which is in short supply in the West.  
• **Specialized Reagents and expertise:** Producing battery-grade, magnet-grade or medical-grade Gd requires technical know-how and reagents (e.g. high-purity solvents, bespoke resins). Currently this know-how is dominated by China/Korea/Japan. US and EU efforts (Solvay, Neo, etc.) are emerging ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20set%20ambitious,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=The%20U,to%20catalyze%20the%20development%20of)), but knowledge transfer and scale-up remain hurdles to reaching full production targets.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2–4 sentences)  
The **primary bottleneck** is the chemical processing chain – especially solvent extraction and separation.  USGS/Reuter’s analysis emphasizes that separating individual rare earth elements (like Gd) via SX or ion-exchange is “the most challenging phase” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Extracted%20ore%20from%20mines%20is,these%20can%20generate%20toxic%20byproducts)).  Currently the U.S. has only one REE mine ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/us-rare-earth-pricing-system-is-poised-challenge-chinas-dominance-2025-07-14/#:~:text=The%20U,to%20catalyze%20the%20development%20of)) and allied efforts are just starting: even the EU expects to meet only ~45% of its REE separation needs by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20set%20ambitious,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by)). Without rapid build-out of advanced SX/column facilities and skilled workforce, allied Gd production capacity will remain well below potential demand, making supply security highly dependent on these technologies ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/complexity-transforming-rare-earths-mine-magnet-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Extracted%20ore%20from%20mines%20is,these%20can%20generate%20toxic%20byproducts)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=The%20EU%20has%20set%20ambitious,only%20limited%20output%20expected%20by)).
