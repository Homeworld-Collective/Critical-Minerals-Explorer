## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is **rubidium extraction and recovery** from existing resources. Rubidium occurs almost exclusively as a minor constituent of lithium–cesium (LCT) pegmatite ores and brines ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=rubidium%20often%20occurs%20associated%20with,are%20mainly%20supplied%20in%20the)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20rubidium%20and%20cesium%20resources,However)). Current lithium/cesium processing circuits generally do not recover it, so most Rb ends up in tailings ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/14/3378#:~:text=and%20the%20existing%20technologies%20have,caused%20by%20the%20shortage%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20rubidium%20and%20cesium%20resources,However)).  Existing extraction technologies have severe limitations – recovery rates of Rb are very low ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/14/3378#:~:text=and%20the%20existing%20technologies%20have,caused%20by%20the%20shortage%20of)) – meaning no cost-effective, large-scale Rb recovery is deployed in the West.  Achieving ultra-high-purity rubidium metal (often **≥99.9%** purity) requires advanced refining (e.g. vacuum distillation and zone refinement), capabilities mostly available in China (and formerly Russia). In fact, a recent Chinese process produced rubidium chloride at 99.9% purity ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20study%20cited,rubidium)), illustrating that such high-purity techniques are currently only mature abroad.  In summary, the lack of an industrial-scale recovery circuit for low-grade rubidium, combined with the need for specialized high-purity refining (and historically low demand), is the key technological bottleneck to ramping up U.S./Allied rubidium production ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/14/3378#:~:text=and%20the%20existing%20technologies%20have,caused%20by%20the%20shortage%20of)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20study%20cited,rubidium)).

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Western rubidium supply currently hinges on recovering trace Rb from LCT mineral and brine streams – a capability we lack at scale ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/14/3378#:~:text=and%20the%20existing%20technologies%20have,caused%20by%20the%20shortage%20of)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20rubidium%20and%20cesium%20resources,However)). Existing Li/Cs plants simply discard rubidium in waste, since separating and concentrating ppm-level Rb economically remains undeveloped.  Moreover, producing the ultrapure rubidium metal needed for quantum/defense (often ≥99.9% purity) requires refining technology largely held by China today ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=In%20a%20new%20study%20cited,rubidium)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/14/3378#:~:text=and%20the%20existing%20technologies%20have,caused%20by%20the%20shortage%20of)). In short, the absence of a viable extraction/purification chain – plus historically minimal demand – is the bottleneck preventing U.S./allied rubidium production.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** 0.0 t/yr – No known domestic rubidium mining or recovery facilities exist.  According to USGS, “the US does not mine any” rubidium ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=No%20official%20data%20exists%20for,the%20US%20list%20of%20critical)); all Rb used is imported.  

• **Canada:** ~0.0 t/yr – Formerly supplied mainly as a byproduct of the Tanco pegmatite (Manitoba) cesium mine.  That mine ceased production by the early 2020s ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=The%20mineral%20is%20typically%20produced,rubidium%2C%20but%20now%20ceased%20operations)).  Canada currently has no active rubidium production (the Raleigh Lake Li–Cs–Ta project has resources but is not yet in production).  

• **Australia:** ~0.0 t/yr – Rubidium was a minor byproduct of past pollucite mining (Sinclair, WA) and tantalum/lithium mining (Wodgina), but these operations ended in 2019 ([hotcopper.com.au](https://hotcopper.com.au/news/asx-news/149544/everest-metals-inks-first-resource-at-mt-edon-for-nearly-8-000-tonnes-with-prices-at-us-1-000-kg/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProduction%20of%20rubidium%20from%20all,assessment%20for%20the%20commodity%20rubidium)).  No Australian facility has produced Rb recently.  

• **EU (incl. Norway, Iceland):** ~0.0 t/yr – No known domestic rubidium production or mining in Europe.  All Rb used in EU industries is imported ([hotcopper.com.au](https://hotcopper.com.au/news/asx-news/149544/everest-metals-inks-first-resource-at-mt-edon-for-nearly-8-000-tonnes-with-prices-at-us-1-000-kg/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProduction%20of%20rubidium%20from%20all,assessment%20for%20the%20commodity%20rubidium)).  

• **Japan:** ~0.0 t/yr – Japan has no rubidium mines or recovery facilities – its entire rubidium supply is imported.  

**Allied total:** ~0 t/yr.  In sum, the US and allied countries currently produce essentially **zero** metric tons of rubidium; they rely 100% on imports. The only past Western sources (Tanco in Canada; Sinclair in Australia) have closed ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=The%20mineral%20is%20typically%20produced,rubidium%2C%20but%20now%20ceased%20operations)) ([hotcopper.com.au](https://hotcopper.com.au/news/asx-news/149544/everest-metals-inks-first-resource-at-mt-edon-for-nearly-8-000-tonnes-with-prices-at-us-1-000-kg/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProduction%20of%20rubidium%20from%20all,assessment%20for%20the%20commodity%20rubidium)), and no new Western production is ongoing.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **North America (US + Canada):** By 2030, demand is expected to grow strongly, driven by expansion of high-tech applications.  Industry reports project global Rb demand rising from about 2.95 kt in 2023 to ~3.88 kt by 2030 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market-to-be-dominated-by-technical-grade-segment-to-reach-3-88-kilotons-by-2030---says-stellar-market-research-302201519.html#:~:text=Rubidium%20Market%20was%202,to%20determine%20the%20market%20volume)).  North America – especially the US – is projected to account for roughly 65–70% of the global market ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period)), implying a demand on the order of ~2.5–2.7 kt/yr by 2030.  Major applications in the US/Canada include highly precise atomic clocks/GNSS timing (telecom and defense timing), quantum computing components, specialty optics (e.g. high-index glass for fiber optics and lasers), and space/defense electronics.  

• **Europe (EU + UK, Norway, Iceland):** European demand is also rising.  Key uses are specialty glass for fiber bundles and laser optics, telecommunications equipment, and aerospace/defense electronics.  Leading economies (Germany, France, etc.) are investing in R&D for rubidium in quantum and photonics.  By 2030, Europe could account for roughly 15–20% of world rubidium demand, or on the order of ~0.6–0.8 kt/yr (primarily supplied by imports).  

• **Asia-Pacific (Japan, Australia, etc.):** Japan identifies rubidium as a critical technological material (for precision instruments, atomic clocks, etc.). Allied Asia–Pacific (Japan, Australia) likely accounts for ~10–15% of global demand.  This translates to roughly ~0.4–0.6 kt/yr by 2030. (Australia’s own rubidium production is negligible, so demand there is met by imports and impending development of projects like Mt Edon.)  

• **Allied total demand:** Summing US/Canada + Europe + Asia allies gives roughly **3,000–3,500 t/yr** by 2030.  This is on the order of 75–90% of projected world demand (reflecting the concentration of high-tech industries in allied nations).  These estimates assume continued growth in rubidium-intensive technologies (quantum computing, advanced navigation, specialty optics, medical imaging, etc.) as discussed in recent market analyses ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market-to-be-dominated-by-technical-grade-segment-to-reach-3-88-kilotons-by-2030---says-stellar-market-research-302201519.html#:~:text=Rubidium%20Market%20was%202,to%20determine%20the%20market%20volume)) ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20rubidium%20market%20size,from%202025%20to%202033)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Domestic production:**  Still ~0 t/yr.  No new rubidium mines or recovery plants are expected to be online by 2030.  Western production capacity remains essentially nil ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=No%20official%20data%20exists%20for,the%20US%20list%20of%20critical)) ([hotcopper.com.au](https://hotcopper.com.au/news/asx-news/149544/everest-metals-inks-first-resource-at-mt-edon-for-nearly-8-000-tonnes-with-prices-at-us-1-000-kg/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CProduction%20of%20rubidium%20from%20all,assessment%20for%20the%20commodity%20rubidium)).  

• **Imports/Near-term supply:** The US and allies will continue to rely entirely on imports for rubidium.  By 2030, imports of roughly 3,000–3,500 t/yr will be required to meet demand.  Potential Western sources under development include Canadian LCT pegmatite projects (e.g. International Lithium’s Raleigh Lake Li–Rb project, which hosts ~822 t contained Rb metal ([www.newsfilecorp.com](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/162266/International-Lithium-Files-Lithium-and-Rubidium-Mineral-Resource-Estimates-for-the-Raleigh-Lake-Lithium-Project-Ontario-Canada#:~:text=Inferred%20%20,%7C%20521))) and Australian pegmatites (e.g. Everest Metals’ Mt Edon project, with a maiden resource of ~7,900 t Rb₂O ([thewest.com.au](https://thewest.com.au/business/bulls-n-bears/good-rubidium-results-build-off-take-potential-for-everest-wa-project-c-17129770#:~:text=A%20maiden%20JORC,7900%20tonnes%20of%20rubidium%20oxide))). However, these projects are only in exploration/R&D stages (pilot plants and scoping studies planned mid-2020s) and will not supply significant commercial Rb until the late 2020s at earliest.  In the near term, allied rubidium supply will chiefly come from established producers abroad (notably China, which currently dominates Rb refining) and any available stockpiles. This situation means allied nations must secure virtually all non-Chinese production (and possibly some Chinese exports) to meet demand.  

• **Supply-demand balance:** With essentially 0 t/yr domestic output, the U.S. and allies must import nearly all ~3–3.5 kt/yr needed by 2030.  If global output is ~3.9 kt and allied demand ~3.5 kt, then Western customers will effectively have to procure most of the non-China supply.  This creates a critical supply-chain vulnerability, as highlighted by recent analyses of the rubidium market ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market-to-be-dominated-by-technical-grade-segment-to-reach-3-88-kilotons-by-2030---says-stellar-market-research-302201519.html#:~:text=Rubidium%20Market%20was%202,to%20determine%20the%20market%20volume)) ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20rubidium%20market%20size,from%202025%20to%202033)).

## References for volumes  
Rubidium production and demand forecasts are drawn from industry and government sources.  For example, a Stellar Market Research report (2024) estimates global rubidium volume at ~2.95 kt in 2023, rising to ~3.88 kt by 2030 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market-to-be-dominated-by-technical-grade-segment-to-reach-3-88-kilotons-by-2030---says-stellar-market-research-302201519.html#:~:text=Rubidium%20Market%20was%202,to%20determine%20the%20market%20volume)).  An IMARC Group analysis (Dec 2024) likewise projects a global Rb market of ~3.0 kt in 2024, growing to ~4.0 kt by 2033 ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20rubidium%20market%20size,from%202025%20to%202033)).  North America’s share is emphasized by Technavio (2022), which found ~70% of market growth originating in NA ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period)).  International Lithium’s published technical report (2023) confirms the ~822 t contained Rb resource at Raleigh Lake ([www.newsfilecorp.com](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/162266/International-Lithium-Files-Lithium-and-Rubidium-Mineral-Resource-Estimates-for-the-Raleigh-Lake-Lithium-Project-Ontario-Canada#:~:text=Inferred%20%20,%7C%20521)), and Everest Metals’ Mt Edon study (2024) reports ~7,900 t Rb₂O resource ([thewest.com.au](https://thewest.com.au/business/bulls-n-bears/good-rubidium-results-build-off-take-potential-for-everest-wa-project-c-17129770#:~:text=A%20maiden%20JORC,7900%20tonnes%20of%20rubidium%20oxide)).  The USGS Commodity Summary (2025) and other sources confirm U.S. production = 0 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=No%20official%20data%20exists%20for,the%20US%20list%20of%20critical)) and allied reliance on imports.  See cited sources for full data and context.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
Exploration targeting rubidium focuses on **LCT (Li–Cs–Ta) pegmatites** and associated potassium-rich rocks. Rubidium substitutes for K in micas (zinnwaldite, lepidolite, muscovite) and K-feldspar, so geologists look for late-stage pegmatite zones with high K-content ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283372019_Rubidium-_and_cesium-dominant_micas_in_granitic_pegmatites#:~:text=K%20in%20micas%20and%20K,)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20rubidium%20and%20cesium%20resources,However)).  Field methods include geological mapping of pegmatite belts, airborne/geophysical surveys (radiometric K anomalies, magnetics for coarse felsic intrusions) and remote sensing (hyperspectral ASTER/SWIR to detect mica/sericite alteration). Geochemical sampling (soils, stream sediments, playas) analyzed by ICP-MS or portable XRF targets multi-element anomalies: rubidium often correlates with K, Li, Cs, Ta, Be.  For instance, pegmatite micas can reach Rb₂O grades ~0.5–0.7%, as seen at known enrichments ([thewest.com.au](https://thewest.com.au/business/bulls-n-bears/good-rubidium-results-build-off-take-potential-for-everest-wa-project-c-17129770#:~:text=A%20maiden%20JORC,7900%20tonnes%20of%20rubidium%20oxide)) ([www.newsfilecorp.com](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/162266/International-Lithium-Files-Lithium-and-Rubidium-Mineral-Resource-Estimates-for-the-Raleigh-Lake-Lithium-Project-Ontario-Canada#:~:text=Inferred%20%20,%7C%20521)), so channel sampling and drilling assays emphasize Rb plus Li–Cs–Ta content.  Portable spectrometers (LIBS, micro-XRF) can screen micas in the field for Rb.  Ultimately, diamond drilling of prioritized targets yields core for full multi-element assay. Rb-rich zones often occur in or near high-grade cesium (pollucite) or lithium zones, so multi-commodity programs (Li–Cs–Rb) are common.

## Key Extraction Technologies  
Rubidium extraction typically follows techniques similar to those for cesium/lithium, adapted to its low concentration. For **hard-rock sources**, crushed LCT pegmatite (mica/feldspar-rich) can be **acid-leached** (sulfuric or hydrochloric acid) to dissolve alkalis and rare elements ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20rubidium%20and%20cesium%20resources,However)). The leachate is then processed via ion-exchange or solvent-extraction: for example, scientists have developed ion-exchange resins that selectively bind Rb⁺ from such leach solutions. Elution with dilute acid yields a concentrated Rb solution.  Laboratory studies (Everest Metals/Edith Cowan Univ.) demonstrate >90% Rb recovery from Mt Edon pegmatite using a water-recycling ion-exchange process ([thewest.com.au](https://thewest.com.au/business/bulls-n-bears/good-rubidium-results-build-off-take-potential-for-everest-wa-project-c-17129770#:~:text=The%20latest%20results%2C%20from%20phase,product)).  

For **brine-based sources**, after lithium extraction, the remaining potassium chloride salts can be processed.  One approach crystallizes KCl out of the brine, concentrating residual Rb in the mother liquor. Chinese researchers extracted ultra-pure RbCl from KCl salt (initially only 0.001% Rb) using tailored crystallization and leaching, achieving 99.9% RbCl ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/chinas-technological-breakthrough-in-rubidium-production/#:~:text=The%20ISL%20researchers%20have%20managed,This%20advancement)).  Brine operations can also apply ion-exchange columns directly to borefield or mother-liquor solutions to capture Rb.  

In practice, new pilot processes aim to integrate these byproduct routes.  For example, at Mt Edon a flowsheet under development uses mining + roasting to upgrade Rb-bearing minerals, followed by water leaching and fractional crystallization to produce purified RbCl ([strategicmetalsinvest.com](https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/weekly-news-review-jun-2-to-8-2025/#:~:text=of%20rubidium,The%20process%20includes%20mining%20and)) ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/chinas-technological-breakthrough-in-rubidium-production/#:~:text=The%20ISL%20researchers%20have%20managed,This%20advancement)).  Similarly, potash or salt industry wastes could be leached or processed through ion-exchange resins to recover dilute Rb.  Membrane and electrodialysis methods have shown promise in labs for concentrating Rb⁺ from mixed brines, but these are still in development.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
After extraction, **selective separation** of Rb⁺ from ionic mixtures is crucial.  One method is specialized cation-exchange resins or crown-ether solvents that preferentially bind Rb over abundant K/Na; multiple stages of batch or continuous columns can isolate Rb from potassium-rich liquor.  Another is **fractional crystallization**: by carefully evaporating or cooling mixed KCl–RbCl solutions, KCl crystallizes first (due to its higher saturation), leaving Rb⁺ concentrated in the remaining liquid.  Repeated crystallization steps can yield an Rb-rich solution ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/chinas-technological-breakthrough-in-rubidium-production/#:~:text=The%20ISL%20researchers%20have%20managed,This%20advancement)).  Vacuum distillation/crystallization is used at ambient pressure too: RbCl has a higher vapor pressure than KCl, so making RbCl salt and subliming it under vacuum effectively purifies Rb.  Emerging methods like multi-stage electrodialysis or hollow-fiber nanofiltration are being explored to continuously extract Rb⁺ from brine streams, though such membrane systems require further scale-up.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
Commercial rubidium is often sold as salts (RbCl, Rb₂CO₃) or metal. Purification begins by converting concentrated Rb solutions to Rb salts, which are then recrystallized or chromatographed to remove trace impurities.  For metallic rubidium, a common route is high-temperature chemical reduction: rubidium chloride is reduced with calcium or aluminum under inert atmosphere, then the crude Rb metal is distilled under vacuum (500–600°C) to separate off any remaining salts or flux.  This vacuum-distilled rubidium metal typically exceeds ~99.9% purity.  For defense/quantum applications requiring up to 5N purity (≥99.999%), further **zone refining** can be used: solid rubidium metal is melted in a small zone that moves through the ingot, sweeping impurities along to one end.  Alternatively, **molten salt electrolysis** of RbCl–KCl eutectic at an inert cathode yields rubidium metal directly; with sufficiently pure input salts, this produces very high-purity Rb.  Complete purification may also involve final polishing steps: passing Rb compounds through chelating ion columns, getters for any residual gases, and multiple recrystallizations. Critical point: each stage (chemical reduction, vacuum distillation, zone refining) removes specific impurities, allowing achievement of electronic-grade rubidium metal. 

## Key Remediation Technologies  
Although rubidium itself is non-toxic (it behaves like potassium biologically), standard mining/environment practices must control byproducts.  Modern extraction designs emphasize **water recycling and waste minimization**: for example, using closed-loop leach circuits and membranes to recover >80% of process water.  Spent acid from ion-exchange or leaching steps is neutralized (lime or base added) to precipitate harmless salts, and any heavy metals in raffinate are co-precipitated or adsorbed prior to discharge.  Tailings from lepidolite roasting or pollucite processing are managed like other mining tailings (thickened pastes or dry stacks with liner containment).  Ion-exchange resins are periodically regenerated with acid/base; regeneration effluents are carefully treated to recover metals (inc. Rb) or neutralized before release.  For brine processing, crystallizer residues (bitterns) are either re-injected or stored in lined ponds, following best practices from potash mining.  Overall, environmental monitoring (water quality, radioactivity, since pollucite can carry some U/Th) and site rehabilitation (re-vegetation, pit backfill) follow typical regulatory frameworks. Since rubidium has no special hazard beyond chemical alkalinity, remediation focuses on neutralizing reagents and restoring habitats, as with lithium or potash mining.

## References for mining technologies  
Several sources discuss rubidium mineral occurrences and extraction.  USGS and academic data show Rb-bearing pegmatites worldwide ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/data/grade-and-tonnage-data-lithium-cesium-and-rubidium-pegmatite-deposits#:~:text=Pegmatites%20are%20a%20major%20host,dominated%20deposits%20where%20available)).

Studies of mica mineralogy highlight Rb enrichment: rubidium routinely substitutes for K in evolved granitic micas (e.g., polylithionite, zinnwaldite) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283372019_Rubidium-_and_cesium-dominant_micas_in_granitic_pegmatites#:~:text=K%20in%20micas%20and%20K,)).  Technical reviews and patents describe methods (acid roasting/leaching of pollucite, alkaline leaching of lepidolite, ion-exchange columns, etc.) for Rb/Cs recovery at pilot scales ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/18/14/3378#:~:text=of%20the%20acid%20leaching%20reaction,concentration%20and%20demonstrates%20excellent%20recovery)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12300911/#:~:text=Currently%2C%20rubidium%20and%20cesium%20resources,However)).  High-level market and industry reports (e.g. IMARC 2024 ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20global%20rubidium%20market%20size,from%202025%20to%202033)), Technavio 2022 ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period))) provide context on production volumes and applications.  Company disclosures (International Lithium, Everest Metals, etc.) supply project-level data on Rb resources ([www.newsfilecorp.com](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/162266/International-Lithium-Files-Lithium-and-Rubidium-Mineral-Resource-Estimates-for-the-Raleigh-Lake-Lithium-Project-Ontario-Canada#:~:text=Inferred%20%20,%7C%20521)) ([thewest.com.au](https://thewest.com.au/business/bulls-n-bears/good-rubidium-results-build-off-take-potential-for-everest-wa-project-c-17129770#:~:text=A%20maiden%20JORC,7900%20tonnes%20of%20rubidium%20oxide)) and test results.  Regulatory reports (USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries) confirm U.S. rubidium output = 0 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/china-achieves-breakthrough-in-rubidium-extraction#:~:text=No%20official%20data%20exists%20for,the%20US%20list%20of%20critical)).
