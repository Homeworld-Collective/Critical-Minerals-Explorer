## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** 0.0 t/year – there are no active rubidium mines or production facilities in the US ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/cesium-and-rubidium-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Rubidium%20was%20discovered%20in%201861,in%20chemical%20and%20electronic%20applications)). Historically, trace rubidium was co-mined with lithium or cesium but has not been recovered since the 1960s ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/cesium-and-rubidium-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Rubidium%20was%20discovered%20in%201861,in%20chemical%20and%20electronic%20applications)).  All rubidium used in the US is imported.  
• **Canada:** ~0 t/year – the only dedicated source was the now-closed Tanco pollucite mine (Manitoba), which ceased operating around 2021.  No current Canadian operations specifically produce rubidium (the Raleigh Lake Li–Rb deposit is still in development) ([www.newsfilecorp.com](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/162266/International-Lithium-Files-Lithium-and-Rubidium-Mineral-Resource-Estimates-for-the-Raleigh-Lake-Lithium-Project-Ontario-Canada#:~:text=Underground%204%2C000ppm%20Rb%20Cut,%7C%20521)).    
• **Australia:** ~0 t/year – Australia’s Sinclair pollucite mine (historical cesium production) also produced minor Rb but exhausted its ore by 2019 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/press-release?id=687d66ecace16b3b85d47f83#:~:text=Mineral%20deposits%20of%20pollucite,and%20rarely%20over%20100%20Mt)). No active Australian rubidium production exists.  
• **EU (including Norway, Iceland):** ~0 t/year – no known EU-based rubidium mineral extraction; any rubidium usage comes from imports. (For context, the EU’s only pollucite mine was Tanco in Canada, and Serbia’s columbo-tantalite mines are outside the EU.)  
• **Japan:** ~0 t/year – Japan has no domestic Rb production (all supply is imported). It is a significant consumer but no Japanese mines produce rubidium.  
• **Allied total:** Essentially 0 t/year. In sum, US + allies currently produce essentially 0 metric tons of rubidium ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/cesium-and-rubidium-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Rubidium%20was%20discovered%20in%201861,in%20chemical%20and%20electronic%20applications)) ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20there%20are,no%20definitive%20evidence%2C%20she%20says)), making them 100% import-dependent. The only past sources (Tanco in Canada; Sinclair in Australia) are closed, and no other Western producers have begun extraction.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **North America (US + Canada):** By 2030, demand is expected to grow steeply with expanding high-tech uses.  Market research projects global rubidium demand rising from ~2.95 kt in 2023 to ~3.88 kt by 2030 ([www.whatech.com](https://www.whatech.com/og/markets-research/materials-chemicals/899967-rubidium-market-growing-trade-among-emerging-economies-opening-new-opportunities-by-2030.html#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20global%20rubidium,vision%20technology)).  North America is projected to account for roughly 70% of this growth ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period)).  If global demand reaches ~3.9 kt, NA demand could be on the order of ~2.6–2.7 kt by 2030 (with the US as the largest single market ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period))).  Key US/Canadian uses include atomic clocks/GNSS (telecom and defense timing), quantum computing components, specialty optics, and space/defense electronics (e.g. rubidium frequency standards ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20rubidium%20market%20in%20North,The%20transaction%2C%20expected%20to)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period))).  
• **Europe (EU + UK, Norway, Iceland):** Europe’s rubidium demand is growing (aerospace, telecom, medical imaging).  Advanced economies like Germany and France are investing in rubidium R&D ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=)). Europe may represent roughly 15–20% of the world market by 2030 (on the order of ~0.6–0.8 kt demand), driven by specialty glass (fiber optics, laser lenses) and defense electronics ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=)).  
• **Asia-Pacific (Japan, Australia, etc.):** Japan is also a priority market (designated critical in Japan’s plans ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rubidium-critical-minerals-2025-technology-applications/#:~:text=economic%20prosperity%20,viable%20alternatives%20exist%20for%20rubidium%27s))) with uses in precision instruments and atomic clocks.  If APAC remains ~20% of demand, Japan/Australia demand might reach ~0.5–0.8 kt by 2030. ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20rubidium%20market%20in%20North,The%20transaction%2C%20expected%20to)) ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=))  
• **Allied total demand:** Summing major allies, US+Canada+EU+Japan+Australia demand could approach **~3,000–3,500 t** by 2030. (This is roughly 75–90% of projected world demand, given North America’s dominance ([www.whatech.com](https://www.whatech.com/og/markets-research/materials-chemicals/899967-rubidium-market-growing-trade-among-emerging-economies-opening-new-opportunities-by-2030.html#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20global%20rubidium,vision%20technology)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rubidium-market---70-of-growth-to-originate-from-north-america--driven-by-diversified-applications-of-rubidium--17000-technavio-reports-301519108.html#:~:text=With%20ISO%209001%3A2015%20certification%2C%20Technavio,America%20over%20the%20forecast%20period)).)  This estimate assumes continued growth in rubidium technologies: quantum computing, atomic navigation, specialty glass, etc., and accounts for higher per-capita use in allied tech industries.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Domestic production:** Still effectively 0 t in 2030 (no new mines are on line).  All above production figures remain at zero ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/cesium-and-rubidium-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Rubidium%20was%20discovered%20in%201861,in%20chemical%20and%20electronic%20applications)) ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20there%20are,no%20definitive%20evidence%2C%20she%20says)).  
• **Imports/Near-term supply:** US + allies will rely entirely on imports to meet demand.  Conservatively, allied supply must equal demand (~3,000–3,500 t/yr by 2030).  Potential allied sources under development include Canadian LCT pegmatite projects (e.g. International Lithium’s Ontario Rb deposit ([www.newsfilecorp.com](https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/162266/International-Lithium-Files-Lithium-and-Rubidium-Mineral-Resource-Estimates-for-the-Raleigh-Lake-Lithium-Project-Ontario-Canada#:~:text=Underground%204%2C000ppm%20Rb%20Cut,%7C%20521))) and Australian projects (Everest Metals’ Mt. Edon Rb discovery).  However, until  these come online, supply will come from foreign producers. Historically, principal sources have been non-allies (e.g. China and Zimbabwe).  With allies’ negligible mining, **nearly 100% of rubidium supply in 2030 will be imported**.  Strategic plans will focus on allied-friendly imports and stockpiles (e.g. sourcing from English-language producers, converting any Rb coproduct from allied lithium projects).  
• **Supply-demand balance:** Given 0 t domestic supply, allied supply (imports) must scale up to match demand.  If demand ~3.5 kt by 2030, allied imports must approach that volume (bearing in mind that some rubidium is used as solution or compounds, so this is rubidium-equivalent).  Global production is only projected ~3.88 kt by 2030 ([www.whatech.com](https://www.whatech.com/og/markets-research/materials-chemicals/899967-rubidium-market-growing-trade-among-emerging-economies-opening-new-opportunities-by-2030.html#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20global%20rubidium,vision%20technology)), so allied nations may need virtually the entire Western portion of that output.

• **Mordor Intelligence (2025):** North America held the largest market share via advanced applications ([www.imarcgroup.com](https://www.imarcgroup.com/rubidium-market-statistics#:~:text=The%20market%20research%20report%20has,established%20infrastructure%20for%20specialized%20materials)). (Used for allied demand breakdown.)  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Pegmatite Field Mapping:** Identify spodumene-lepidolite (LCT) pegmatites, since rubidium concentrates in K-rich minerals within Li–Cs–Ta pegmatite systems ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/4/369#:~:text=indicate%20that%20mica%20minerals%20primarily,mineral%20dissociation%20during%20the%20grinding)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/4/369#:~:text=In%20nature%2C%20Rb%20and%20Cs,making%20the%20study%20of%20their)).  Geological mapping of known rare-metal pegmatite belts (e.g. the Canadian Shield, Australia’s Greenbushes, Europe’s albitite zones) can highlight Rb prospects.  Geologists look for late-stage albite/mica zones in granites (highly differentiated stress fields) where Rb can exceed 0.1% ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/4/369#:~:text=indicate%20that%20mica%20minerals%20primarily,mineral%20dissociation%20during%20the%20grinding)).  
• **Geochemical Surveys:** Systematic sampling of soils, stream sediments, and rocks around prospective pegmatites, followed by ICP–MS or XRF analysis for Rb (and its pathfinders Li, Cs, K, Ta).  Because rubidium often tracks with potassium (K) and lithium, anomalies in those elements can flag Rb-rich zones.  Multi-element geochemistry is key: e.g. an Rb–Cs anomaly with elevated Li, Be, Nb/Ta commonly indicates LCT mineralization ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/4/369#:~:text=In%20nature%2C%20Rb%20and%20Cs,making%20the%20study%20of%20their)).  
• **Spectral & Geophysical Techniques:** Remote-sensing (such as ASTER or hyperspectral imaging) can detect alteration minerals (white mica, K-feldspar, quartz) typical of pegmatites. Airborne magnetics or gravity may reveal coarse-grained felsic intrusions. Less commonly, radiometric surveys can detect ⁴⁰K (from feldspar/mica) as a proxy for K/Rb mineralization.  
• **Mineralogical Analysis:** Field-portable XRF or lab-based electron microprobe identifies mica (biotite, lepidolite, zinnwaldite) or feldspar minerals with high Rb content.  Petrological studies of drill core (optical microscopy, SEM) can show Rb ∼1300 ppm in zinnwaldite vs. ∼100–200 ppm in muscovite ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/4/369#:~:text=indicate%20that%20mica%20minerals%20primarily,mineral%20dissociation%20during%20the%20grinding)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/4/369#:~:text=In%20nature%2C%20Rb%20and%20Cs,making%20the%20study%20of%20their)).  Targeting zones with heavy K-feldspar/mica fractions is a discriminator.  
• **Exploration Drilling & Assay:** Drilling directed targets yields core for assay.  New projects (e.g. Idaho’s Seymour Project) report Rb assays (e.g. 0.27% Rb₂O in bulk) from pegmatites ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rubidium-critical-minerals-2025-technology-applications/#:~:text=The%20newly%20identified%20rubidium%20resource,Key%20technical%20parameters%20include)) ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/rubidium-critical-minerals-2025-technology-applications/#:~:text=While%20detailed%20comparative%20data%20on,addition%20to%20global%20supply%20potential)). Fingerprinting Rb in early drill holes (along with Li–Cs–Ta) helps delineate Rb-rich zones.

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Direct Lithium-Pegmatite Leaching:** Crushed LCT pegmatite ore is treated with dilute acids (e.g. H₂SO₄ or HCl) to dissolve alkalis and rare elements. The acidic slurry is then run through ion-exchange columns or solvent-extraction circuits to separate Rb and Li ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=Lithium%20and%20rubidium%20are%20both,other%20side%20of%20the%20column)). (For example, a three-stage process: acid leach → Rb-selective resin → dilute HCl strip yields concentrated Rb solution ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=Lithium%20and%20rubidium%20are%20both,other%20side%20of%20the%20column)).)  
• **Binary Salt Treatment (Brine Salt Leach):** At lithium brine operations, after evaporating brine to crystallize potassium salts (KCl), the resulting solid salt can be leached to extract trace Rb. Tianjin University developed a method to extract Rb from solid KCl salt (left from brine evaporation) with 98% less energy than conventional wet brine extraction ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=Researchers%20from%20Tianjin%20University%20in,rubidium%20directly%20from%20watery%20brine)). This takes advantage of Rb partitioning into co-crystallized salts.  
• **Recovery from Waste Streams:** Many Rb extraction processes derive it as a byproduct of Li/Cs recovery. For example, processing spent lithium-ion battery chemicals or KCl waste from potash production using ion-exchange resins can yield Rb. Novel approaches (Everest Metals/ECU) focus on treating the mica-rich waste from lithium flows, adding a water-recycling column system to pull Rb out as a commercial product ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=The%20technique%20recycles%20water%20through,before%20refocusing%20on%20%2018)).  
• **Ion-Exchange/Resin Column Separation:** The industry-standard technique for final Rb recovery is ion-exchange. A strongly acidic cation resin binds Rb⁺ from solution. A carefully chosen strip solution (e.g. dilute sulfuric or hydrochloric acid of controlled strength) then elutes Rb selectively ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=Lithium%20and%20rubidium%20are%20both,other%20side%20of%20the%20column)). This chromatic approach, long used for U or Li, is being adapted for Rb.  
• **Membrane & Desalination Techniques:** Advanced membrane processes (e.g. selective electrodialysis) can concentrate Rb from liquor.  Research in Australia is applying reverse osmosis or nanofiltration to recycle >80% of process water ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=The%20technique%20recycles%20water%20through,before%20refocusing%20on%20%2018)) and to separate RbCl from other salts, lowering overall environmental footprint.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Selective Ion-Exchange:** Downstream from extraction leach, additional resin steps or chelating agents can purify Rb. Weak bases or specialty resins that prefer larger alkali ions permit separation of Rb⁺ from K⁺.  For instance, 18-crown-6 ether analogues (in LLE or impregnated on supports) selectively complex Rb⁺ over K⁺, enabling liquid–liquid extraction steps (crown ethers are not common commercially yet, but research shows promise).  
• **Fractional Crystallization:** Exploiting slight solubility differences: by carefully controlling evaporation of mixed KCl/RbCl brines, KCl tends to crystallize first, enriching Rb in the remaining solution.  Repeated recrystallization and decanting can yield a more Rb-rich liquor to feed resin columns. This approach is analogous to Cs recovery from brines.  
• **Electroless Distillation:** Rubidium forms volatile chlorides (RbCl boils at ~1,400 °C under atmospheric pressure). In molten-salt processes, heating the salt mixture can preferentially vaporize RbCl (or RbF) and then condense it, gradually separating it from the bulk salt. Industrially, vacuum distillation onto cold fingers is a traditional path to high-purity alkali metals.  
• **Membrane & Ion-Exchange Hybrid:** Combining membranes and resins, e.g. electrodialysis with chelating membranes, can continuously extract Rb⁺ from solution into a paired anion/cation membrane stack, though this is largely experimental at present.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Chemical Reduction & Metal Distillation:** For metal rubidium, the classical route is reducing RbCl with calcium or aluminum metal (thermally in an inert crucible). The resultant mixture contains Rb metal and CaCl₂. Rubidium’s high vapor pressure allows vacuum distillation (e.g. at ~500–600 °C under reduced pressure) to separate Rb from salt impurities. Specialized metal-refining lines (e.g. Schlenk techniques) ensure rubidium metal ≥99.99%. Industrial refinement often ends in a high-vacuum furnace with cold traps.  
• **Zone Refining:** Analogous to semiconductor purification, molten rubidium can be subjected to zone-refining. A moving molten zone (induced by an induction coil) carries impurities ahead, leaving a high-purity zone behind. This technique can push Rb purity to “astronomical” levels needed for lasers and atomic clocks.  
• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Direct electrolysis of a Rb compound melt (e.g. RbCl–KCl eutectic) at an inert cathode can deposit rubidium metal.  This is similar to Na/K production. It inherently yields high purity if impurities are excluded from the crucible.  
• **Precipitation Purification:** For Rb compounds (e.g. Rb₂CO₃, Rb۲SO₄), repeated recrystallization and washing removes trace Pb, K, or Na. Combining carbonatation (to convert Rb hydroxides to carbonate or nitrate) with slow crystallization can enhance purity of Rb products. Ion chromatography is also used analytically to certify purity.  
• **Final Polishing:** For ultra-high-purity rubidium (99.999% needed in defense tech ([www.chemistryworld.com](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/military-demand-strains-metal-supply-chains/4021695.article#:~:text=China%20does%20not%20control%20mining,%E2%80%99))), multiple methods may be required: e.g. passing dissolved Rb through complexant columns (chelating agents), employing chromatography kits (affinity for heavy metals), and sublimating Rb metal under high vacuum.

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Water Recovery & Waste Minimization:** New extraction processes (e.g. Everest Metals/ECU’s method) emphasize water recycling through nanofiltration membranes. By recycling >80% of process water ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=The%20technique%20recycles%20water%20through,before%20refocusing%20on%20%2018)), they minimize effluent volumes. This also traps most Rb in a smaller volume for recovery, mitigating salt-brine disposal.  
• **Acid Neutralization & Tailings Treatment:** Spent acid or salt slurries from leaching must be neutralized (typically with lime) and precipitated. Metals like CaSO₄ or CaCO₃ form harmless solids. Advanced treatments (reverse osmosis, evaporation ponds) can concentrate and crystallize residual salts (mostly KCl, NaCl). Tailings are managed similar to other potash or lithium tailings, with geochemical containment.  
• **Resin Regeneration:** Ion-exchange media are regenerated by acid/alkali, producing concentrated waste streams. These are treated to recover co-precipitated metals and to neutralize before discharge. Modern resins can be regenerated with minimal cross-contamination of Rb vs. K.  
• **Brine Management:** If sourced from salt lakes, evaporation ponds are used. Any residual brine (after KCl harvest) is left in sealed ponds or reinjected. Since Rb is a tiny fraction (<0.01% of material), environmental impact is low. Technologies used in potash mining (valved ponds, grout curtains) are applicable.  
• **Environmental Monitoring:** Given rubidium’s low toxicity (chemically similar to potassium), remediation focuses on habitat restoration (filling of pits, revegetation) and ensuring none of the strong reagents (acids, solvents) reach groundwater. Compliance with critical-mineral extraction guidelines ensures cleanup planning.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The primary bottleneck is **extraction and recovery** of rubidium from existing resources.  In practice, rubidium is usually a trace by-product of lithium or cesium mining, but current lithium-processing plants have no built-in Rb recovery steps.  Without chemistries or circuits to separate rubidium economically from co-processing streams, virtually all Rb ends up in tailings ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20there%20are,no%20definitive%20evidence%2C%20she%20says)).  In essence, the technology to recover low-concentration Rb (ion-exchange setups, solvent systems specific to Rb⁺) is not yet deployed at scale.  Additionally, achieving the ultra-high material purity needed (often ≈99.999%) requires specialized refining know-how that currently exists almost exclusively overseas ([www.chemistryworld.com](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/military-demand-strains-metal-supply-chains/4021695.article#:~:text=China%20does%20not%20control%20mining,%E2%80%99)).  Thus, the **lack of scalable processing technology to isolate and purify rubidium**, combined with historically low demand (discouraging investment), is the key technological bottleneck to ramping up Western rubidium production ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20there%20are,no%20definitive%20evidence%2C%20she%20says)) ([www.chemistryworld.com](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/military-demand-strains-metal-supply-chains/4021695.article#:~:text=China%20does%20not%20control%20mining,%E2%80%99)).

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Western rubidium supply hinges on extracting Rb from byproduct streams, but no large-scale process for this exists domestically.  Standard lithium/cesium facilities simply discard rubidium, as low volumes and high purification costs make Rb unprofitable without dedicated circuits ([spectrum.ieee.org](https://spectrum.ieee.org/rubidium#:~:text=As%20of%20now%2C%20there%20are,no%20definitive%20evidence%2C%20she%20says)).  In short, the absence of economically viable extraction/separation technology – plus the challenge of achieving defense-grade 99.999% purity ([www.chemistryworld.com](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/military-demand-strains-metal-supply-chains/4021695.article#:~:text=China%20does%20not%20control%20mining,%E2%80%99)) – is the critical bottleneck preventing US/allied rubidium production.
