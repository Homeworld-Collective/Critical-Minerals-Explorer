## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Industrial-scale lithium chemical refining capacity; proven DLE at commercial scale*

The critical bottleneck is **scaling refined lithium output from domestic resources**. Despite abundant potential brine and clay deposits, the U.S./Allies lack large-scale lithium chemical refining plants. Albemarle cancelled its planned $1.3 billion refinery in South Carolina in January 2025, citing unfavorable economics. Many U.S. projects rely on unproven Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technologies – Standard Lithium's Arkansas demonstration plant processes only 10-20 gallons per minute, far below commercial requirements of thousands of gallons per minute. Until high-throughput DLE systems and commercial-grade carbonate/hydroxide refineries are operational (requiring either technological breakthroughs or substantial government support), allied supply will remain severely constrained. The lack of domestic refining capacity means even successfully mined lithium must be sent to China for processing, undermining supply chain security goals.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~95,000 tons LCE/year (Australia ~85,000; US ~5,000; Canada ~3,500; EU/Japan 0)*

• **United States:** ~5,000 t/yr LCE – Albemarle's Silver Peak brine operation in Nevada is the only active producer. Several projects are in development including Lithium Americas' Thacker Pass (clay) and ioneer's Rhyolite Ridge (clay-boron), both in Nevada.

• **Australia:** Largest allied producer at approximately 85,000-90,000 t/yr LCE (2023). Western Australia's spodumene pegmatite mines (Greenbushes, Mt Marion, Wodgina, Pilgangoora, Mt Cattlin) supply approximately 46-52% of global lithium production. Major producers include Albemarle/Tianqi (Greenbushes), Mineral Resources Ltd (Mt Marion, Wodgina), and Pilbara Minerals (Pilgangoora).

• **Canada:** ~3,500 t/yr LCE in 2023, primarily from Quebec's North American Lithium mine (Sayona Mining). Additional projects under development include Nemaska Lithium's Whabouchi and Critical Elements' Rose project in Quebec.

• **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** Currently zero commercial lithium production. Pilot/demonstration projects under development include Keliber (Finland), Zinnwald (Germany), and Savannah (Portugal). First commercial production expected 2026-2028.

• **Japan:** 0 t/yr – no domestic lithium mining (fully import-dependent).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 800,000-1,200,000 tons LCE/year*

Demand will be dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) and battery energy storage systems. Based on IEA and benchmark forecasts, global lithium demand is projected to reach 2.4-3.0 million t LCE by 2030. US and allied markets (US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Canada, Australia) are expected to account for 35-40% of global demand, implying **800,000-1,200,000 t LCE** annually by 2030. This assumes:
- US: 250,000-350,000 t LCE (50% EV market penetration, ~8 million EVs/year)
- EU: 300,000-400,000 t LCE (60% EV market penetration, ~10 million EVs/year)
- Japan/South Korea: 150,000-200,000 t LCE
- Other allies: 100,000-250,000 t LCE
Battery storage adds 15-20% to these figures.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 250,000-350,000 tons LCE/year capacity*

Even with planned projects, domestic supply in 2030 will fall far short of demand:
• **United States:** Thacker Pass Phase 1 (40,000 t/yr LCE starting 2028), Rhyolite Ridge (22,000 t/yr LCE starting 2028), plus existing Silver Peak could total 65,000-70,000 t/yr LCE by 2030.
• **Australia:** Expansion of existing operations plus new projects (Kathleen Valley, Finniss) could increase capacity to 150,000-200,000 t/yr LCE.
• **Canada:** Quebec projects (Whabouchi, Rose, Moblan) could add 20,000-30,000 t/yr LCE.
• **EU:** Keliber (15,000 t/yr), Savannah (25,000 t/yr), and other projects might contribute 40,000-50,000 t/yr LCE if all proceed on schedule.

Total allied capacity: **250,000-350,000 t/yr LCE** by 2030 – meeting only 25-35% of projected allied demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: MT/gravity geophysics for brines; magnetic/radiometric for pegmatites; geochemical sampling; remote sensing*

• **Magnetotelluric (MT/AMT/CSAMT) surveys:** Deep resistivity imaging locates buried lithium-rich brine aquifers. Conductive brines in closed basins create strong resistivity contrasts detectable to depths >1000m. Successfully used in Nevada's Clayton Valley and Argentina's salars.

• **Gravity surveys:** Detect density contrasts between spodumene pegmatites (2.7-2.8 g/cm³) and host rocks. Bouguer gravity anomalies help map pegmatite geometry at depth. Applied successfully at Greenbushes and Canadian pegmatite fields.

• **Magnetic and radiometric surveys:** Aeromagnetic data maps structural controls and lithologic boundaries. Pegmatites often appear as magnetic lows. Radiometric surveys detect potassium halos around LCT pegmatites. UAV-based surveys provide high-resolution data for detailed targeting.

• **Geological mapping & geochemical sampling:** Surface mapping identifies LCT (Li-Cs-Ta) pegmatite outcrops and evaporite basins. Soil/stream sediment sampling for Li, Cs, Rb, Be pathfinder elements defines dispersion halos. Portable XRF enables rapid field screening.

• **Remote sensing:** Multispectral satellite imagery (ASTER, Sentinel-2) detects clay alteration associated with lithium deposits. LiDAR reveals subtle topographic features of ancient lake basins. Hyperspectral imaging identifies lithium-bearing minerals directly.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Open-pit mining for hard rock; brine pumping/evaporation; DLE adsorption/ion-exchange; clay heap leaching*

• **Hard-rock (spodumene) mining:** Conventional open-pit mining of pegmatites containing 1.0-1.5% Li₂O. Ore is crushed, ground, and concentrated via dense media separation and flotation to produce 5-6% Li₂O spodumene concentrate. Australia's Greenbushes produces >750,000 t/yr concentrate.

• **Evaporative brine extraction:** Pumping lithium-rich brine (200-1,400 ppm Li) from salar aquifers into sequential evaporation ponds. Solar evaporation over 12-18 months concentrates lithium 20-40x while precipitating other salts. Used in Chile's Atacama (SQM, Albemarle) and Argentina.

• **Direct lithium extraction (DLE):** Selective recovery of lithium from brines without evaporation ponds, using:
  - Adsorption: Aluminum-based adsorbents (Livent), manganese oxides (E3 Lithium)
  - Ion exchange: Lithium-selective resins (Sunresin, Lilac Solutions)
  - Membrane separation: Nanofiltration/electrodialysis (Summit Nanotech)
  Processing time reduced from months to hours/days.

• **Clay extraction:** Acid or alkaline leaching of lithium-bearing clays (0.2-0.4% Li). Thacker Pass will use sulfuric acid leaching in vats, while other projects explore heap leaching. Still unproven at commercial scale.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Ion-exchange resins; solvent extraction; membrane separation; selective precipitation*

• **Ion-exchange/Adsorption:** Lithium-selective resins or inorganic sorbents (manganese/titanium oxides, aluminum hydroxides) capture Li⁺ from solutions. After loading, lithium is eluted with acid or water to produce concentrated lithium chloride solution. Recovery rates >90% achieved in pilot plants.

• **Solvent extraction (SX):** Tributyl phosphate (TBP) and ionic liquid systems extract lithium from brines. FMC/Livent's process in Argentina uses selective organic extractants. Chinese refineries use SX to purify lithium from lepidolite leach solutions.

• **Membrane separation:** Nanofiltration removes divalent ions (Mg²⁺, Ca²⁺) while passing Li⁺. Electrodialysis with monovalent-selective membranes concentrates lithium. Bipolar membrane electrodialysis converts LiCl to LiOH without chemicals.

• **Chemical precipitation:** Sequential precipitation removes impurities:
  - Ca(OH)₂ precipitates Mg as Mg(OH)₂
  - Na₂CO₃ precipitates Ca as CaCO₃
  - Addition of Na₂CO₃ to purified Li solution yields Li₂CO₃ (>99.5% purity)

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Spodumene roasting/conversion; carbonate precipitation; hydroxide crystallization; ion-exchange polishing*

• **Spodumene conversion:** Concentrate is calcined at 1050-1100°C to convert α-spodumene to reactive β-form. Roasted spodumene is digested with concentrated H₂SO₄ at 250°C forming Li₂SO₄. Water leaching dissolves lithium; impurities are removed via pH adjustment and filtration. Final Li recovery >85%.

• **Carbonate production:** Purified Li₂SO₄ or LiCl solution is treated with Na₂CO₃ at 85-95°C to precipitate battery-grade Li₂CO₃. Multiple recrystallization steps achieve >99.5% purity with <100 ppm total impurities.

• **Hydroxide production:** Two main routes:
  - Causticization: Li₂CO₃ + Ca(OH)₂ → 2LiOH + CaCO₃
  - Electrolysis: LiCl solution in bipolar membrane cells
  LiOH·H₂O crystallization yields battery-grade product (>56.5% LiOH).

• **Ion-exchange polishing:** Mixed-bed ion exchange removes trace Na, K, Ca, Mg to achieve <10 ppm each. Chelating resins remove trace metals (Fe, Cu, Pb <1 ppm). Critical for battery-grade specifications.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Membrane water recovery; chemical neutralization; tailings management; brine reinjection*

• **Membrane-based water treatment:** Reverse osmosis recovers 70-85% of process water from spent brines. Concentrated reject brine is reinjected or further processed. Forward osmosis and membrane distillation handle high-salinity streams. Zero liquid discharge systems eliminate aqueous waste.

• **Chemical neutralization:** Lime treatment neutralizes acid mine drainage and precipitates metals. CO₂ injection into alkaline process water precipitates carbonates and adjusts pH. Sulfate removal via ettringite precipitation protects downstream water quality.

• **Tailings management:** Dry stacking of filtered tailings (15-20% moisture) minimizes footprint and water consumption. Co-disposal with waste rock creates stable landforms. Progressive rehabilitation establishes vegetation cover. Spodumene tailings are generally benign (low metals, neutral pH).

• **Brine reinjection:** Spent brine from DLE operations is reinjected into source aquifers or deeper formations. Maintains hydraulic balance and prevents subsidence. Monitoring ensures no freshwater contamination. Required in most jurisdictions for brine operations.

• **Passive treatment systems:** Constructed wetlands treat low-flow drainage. Limestone channels neutralize acidity. Biofilters with sulfate-reducing bacteria precipitate metals. Long-term solution for closed sites.

## Key Bottleneck summary
The main bottleneck is **industrial-scale lithium chemical refining capacity**. While lithium resources are abundant, converting raw materials (spodumene concentrate, brine, clay) into battery-grade chemicals requires sophisticated processing facilities that don't exist in allied countries outside Australia and limited US capacity. China controls >60% of global lithium refining, processing most Australian spodumene. Building a single 20,000 t/yr LCE refinery costs $500M-1B and takes 3-5 years. Technical challenges include: (1) DLE technologies remain unproven at scale, (2) clay processing (Thacker Pass) is untested commercially, (3) environmental permitting takes 5-10 years in US/EU, and (4) Chinese refiners have 10-15 year technical lead and cost advantages. Without massive government support for refinery construction and accelerated permitting, the US/allied supply chain will remain dependent on Chinese processing through 2030 and beyond.
