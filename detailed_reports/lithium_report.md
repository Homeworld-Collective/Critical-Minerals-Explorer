## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** 0 t/yr – no active lithium mines (all deposits are still in exploration or permitting)【Context】.  
• **Australia:** by far the largest allied producer. Western Australia’s spodumene pegmatite mines (Greenbushes, Mt Marion, Wodgina, etc.) supply the bulk of world production. Global output was ~250,000 t Li (content) in 2024 ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=match%20at%20L660%20Image%3A%20Production,to%20almost%20600%2C000%20by%202029Figure%C2%A08)), and the majority (~60–70%) came from Australia. Major producers include Albemarle/Tianqi (Greenbushes, Mt Marion) and Mineral Resources Ltd (Mt Marion, Wodgina).  
• **Canada:** estimated ~4,300 t in 2024 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1456923/canada-mine-production-of-lithium/#:~:text=Canada%20produced%20an%20estimated%204%2C300,with%20Ontario%20taking%20second%20place)) (up from ~520 t/yr in 2023). Production comes from new hard-rock spodumene/pegmatite projects in Quebec (Whabouchi, Moblan) and possibly Manitoba. Key companies: Sigma Lithium (Brazil partner exploring in Canada), North American Lithium (Now Vertellus/Rio Tinto JV at Whabouchi) among others.  
• **European Union (EU)**/**Norway/Iceland:** Currently essentially zero commercial lithium output; only pilot/demonstration mines (e.g. Keliber in Finland, Zinnwald in Germany/Czech, Cinovec in Czech) are under development. No EU nation produces significant lithium yet ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/portuguese-company-eyes-two-lithium-refineries-iberia-by-2030-2024-05-21/#:~:text=A%20newly%20founded%20Portuguese%20company%2C,The%20refined%20lithium%20hydroxide%20is)).  
• **Japan:** 0 t/yr – no domestic lithium mining (fully import-dependent).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Demand will be dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) and battery storage. For context, Albemarle projects global lithium (carbonate-equivalent) demand of ~3.3 M t by 2030 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/d7a624ea-46a9-42b6-a1e6-8a5e47dfaedd#:~:text=Albemarle%2C%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20lithium,EV%20adoption%20in%20key%20western)). Even if US and allied markets only account for ~30–50% of global demand, this implies on the order of **1–1.7 M t LCE** (~190–320 kt Li) per year by 2030. For example, reaching 50% EV market share in the US and EU would consume on the order of 100–200 kt Li₂CO₃ annually. In sum, US/allied demand for 2030 is likely in the low‐million‐ton (LCE) range – **hundreds of thousands of tonnes** of lithium carbonate equivalent, reflecting major EV and grid-battery programs ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/d7a624ea-46a9-42b6-a1e6-8a5e47dfaedd#:~:text=Albemarle%2C%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20lithium,EV%20adoption%20in%20key%20western)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Even with planned projects, domestic supply in 2030 will fall far short of demand. Notable examples: Lithium Americas’ Thacker Pass (NV) is designed (two-phase) to produce **60,000 t/yr Li₂CO₃** (Phase 2 capacity) by 2026 ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Large,pit%20mine%20plan%20with)). Canada’s new mines (Quebec and Manitoba) may add tens of thousands t/yr LCE, but many are early-stage. Australia will likely expand current output (Greenbushes, Pilbara), but oversupply has already led to project slowdowns. EU projects (Finland’s Keliber, Portugal/Spain’s Savannah/Lifthium) could add a few 10,000 t LCE by 2030. Summing announced projects suggests allied capacity on the order of **100–200 kt/yr LCE** (≈20–40 kt Li metal) by 2030 – an order of magnitude below projected need. This highlights that even with all planned mines coming online, US/allied supply will remain insufficient and heavily reliant on imports ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Large,pit%20mine%20plan%20with)) ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/d7a624ea-46a9-42b6-a1e6-8a5e47dfaedd#:~:text=Albemarle%2C%20the%20world%27s%20largest%20lithium,EV%20adoption%20in%20key%20western)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Magnetotelluric (MT/AMT/CSAMT) surveys:** Use deep resistivity imaging to locate buried salty-brine aquifers. Lithium-rich closed basins (e.g. salt flats) exhibit high conductivity contrasts, detectable via MT ([www.ageophysics.com](https://www.ageophysics.com/en/useful-resources/case-studies-and-news/identifying-lithium-deposits-and-reducing-drilling-costs-with-geophysics#:~:text=1,basin%20lithium)).  
• **Gravity surveys:** Measure subtle density contrasts to target pegmatites. Spodumene-bearing pegmatites often have higher density than surrounding host rock, so gravity anomalies can flag potential hard-rock lithium veins ([www.ageophysics.com](https://www.ageophysics.com/en/useful-resources/case-studies-and-news/identifying-lithium-deposits-and-reducing-drilling-costs-with-geophysics#:~:text=2,gravity%20helped%20%205%20target)).  
• **Magnetic and UAV magnetics:** Map structural trends and lithologic boundaries. By highlighting magnetic anomalies (or lows where fresh pegmatite intrudes non-magnetic country rock), aeromagnetic (including drone-based) data help pinpoint lithium-bearing granite bodies ([www.ageophysics.com](https://www.ageophysics.com/en/useful-resources/case-studies-and-news/identifying-lithium-deposits-and-reducing-drilling-costs-with-geophysics#:~:text=3,help%20identify%20areas%20of%20interest)).  
• **Geological mapping & geochemical sampling:** Surface mapping identifies LCT (Li–Cs–Ta) pegmatite outcrops and salars. Stream/soil geochemistry (assaying Li, boron, cesium, beryllium, etc.) scouts dispersion halos around mineralized zones. This classic approach underpins many discoveries in Australia, Canada and Chile. (Example: sampling in Nevada’s Clayton basin identified lithium-rich claystone prior to Thacker Pass.)  
• **Remote sensing:** Satellite/airborne multispectral and LiDAR can detect geomorphic features of ancient lake basins or alteration in pegmatites, aiding drill targeting.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Hard-rock (spodumene) mining:** Conventional open-pit mining of pegmatites. For example, Australia’s Greenbushes and Pilbara operations use large dragline/excavator fleets to mine ~6–7% Li₂O ore, which is crushed, milled and concentrated by flotation. (Thacker Pass PFS targets similar spodumene ore, calcined and leached ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=%2A%20Large,pit%20mine%20plan%20with)).)  
• **Evaporative brine extraction:** Pumping of saline groundwater from salt flats (salares) into massive evaporation ponds (Chile’s Atacama, Argentina’s Salinas Grandes). Sun evaporates water for 12–18 months, increasing Li concentration 20–30×. The resulting brine is then chemically processed to precipitate Li₂CO₃ or LiOH (Albemarle/SQM process).  
• **Direct lithium extraction (DLE):** Rapid adsorption or ion-exchange techniques directly concentrate Li from brine without ponds. Leading examples: Standard Lithium installs adsorption columns (Koch Tech sorbent) at its Arkansas pilot in the Smackover Formation ([cen.acs.org](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Lithium-producers-zero-technology-direct/102/web/2024/05#:~:text=In%20May%2C%20US%20Magnesium%20picked,based%20DLE%20technology)); Lilac Solutions is field-testing Li-selective ion-exchange beads on brines in the US and Canada. DLE can use resin columns, ion-sieve reactors or selective membranes.  
• **Oilfield/geothermal brines:** Co-produced waters from oil/gas wells and geothermal plants can also yield Li. For instance, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum are piloting DLE on Arkansas oilfield brines ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/ab1f74c5-4b07-465f-aa1f-3bf89418ba87#:~:text=The%20U,Formation%20offers%20high%20lithium%20concentrations)). In California/Nevada, geothermal fluids (high T, moderate Li) are being tested for Li recovery via solvent or electrochemical methods. These non-traditional sources could supplement supply if DLE is commercialized.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Ion-exchange/Adsorption:** Selective resins or inorganic sorbents (e.g. manganese/titanium oxides, zeolites) capture Li⁺ from leach solutions or brines. After loading, Li is eluted by acid or alkali to produce a purified Li stream. (Used in Lilac’s process, Standard Lithium’s resin modules, etc.)  
• **Solvent extraction (SX):** Although lithium’s small size makes SX challenging, a few processes use crown-ether-based or quaternary-ammonium solvents to preferentially extract Li over competing alkali. Such SX is used in some Chinese plants and is under development for hard-rock brines.  
• **Membrane separation:** Electrodialysis and nanofiltration membranes concentrate or separate Li. For example, electrodialysis with bipolar membranes can convert LiCl into LiOH (bypassing calcination) – a method used in commercial Asian plants. Species-selective nano-filtration can also remove divalent cations (Mg²⁺/Ca²⁺) from brine to boost Li purity.  
• **Chemical precipitation:** After concentration, Li is precipitated as a solid salt. In brine and spodumene processes, adding **Na₂CO₃** yields Li₂CO₃; adding **Ca(OH)₂** yields LiOH. For example, after a sulfuric-acid leach at Thacker Pass, Na₂CO₃ is added to precipitate high-purity Li₂CO₃ ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=production%20process,reagents%20to%20precipitate%20magnesium%20hydroxide)), and Mg²⁺ is simultaneously removed by Ca(OH)₂ as Mg(OH)₂ ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=production%20process,reagents%20to%20precipitate%20magnesium%20hydroxide)). These steps separate Li from co-existing ions.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Spodumene conversion:** Milled spodumene concentrate is first heated (~1050 °C) to convert α-spodumene to β-spodumene (more reactive), then sulfuric acid-roasted to form Li₂SO₄. This sulfate is leached with water, impurities (Fe, Al, Ba, Ca) are filtered out, and the filtered Li₂SO₄ solution is neutralized with Na₂CO₃ to yield battery-grade Li₂CO₃ ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=production%20process,reagents%20to%20precipitate%20magnesium%20hydroxide)). Thacker Pass’s PFS calls for an integrated sulfuric-acid roast and water-leach followed by CO₂ “bicarbonation” ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=production%20process,reagents%20to%20precipitate%20magnesium%20hydroxide)).  
• **Hydroxide production:** Some markets prefer LiOH. Purified LiCl (from brine) can be electrochemically converted to LiOH via bipolar-membrane electrodialysis (EEDBM) or by precipitating CaCO₃/LiOH with Ca(OH)₂. This step usually follows carbonate precipitation (by decomposing Li₂CO₃ with CaO) or chloride evaporation.  
• **Ion-exchange polishing:** Battery-grade Li salts demand extremely low impurity levels. Anion and cation exchange resin beds (e.g. Lewatit, Amberlite types) remove residual Na, K, Mg, Cl, SO₄, etc. for battery-grade specs. Ultrafiltration and activated-carbon filters may also be used to scrub trace organics or particulates.  
• **Recrystallization and milling:** The precipitated Li₂CO₃/LiOH solids are melted or dissolved and re-crystallized to achieve uniform particle size and >99.5% purity. For example, submicron fumed-silica can be added during LiOH crystallization to control crystal habit and remove silica impurities. Specialized high-temperature/double-carbonation circuits ensure final product meets battery-grade purity (≤0.005% Na, ≤0.003% Ca, etc.).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Membrane-based water treatment:** High-recovery RO/nanofiltration units treat spent brine wastewater. For instance, Fluence’s NIROBOX (reverse-osmosis) and Aspiral (membrane aerated biofilm) systems can concentrate residual salts and recover water for reuse, improving water efficiency in arid extraction sites ([www.fluencecorp.com](https://www.fluencecorp.com/using-membranes-to-recover-lithium-from-wastewater/#:~:text=As%20research%20and%20development%20proceed%2C,wastewater%20treatment%20units%20are%20packaged)). Selective ion membranes (e.g. metal–organic-framework or vermiculite membranes) are being tested to extract lithium from dilute wastewater streams; a recent lab-scale MOF membrane showed >90% Li⁺ selectivity ([www.fluencecorp.com](https://www.fluencecorp.com/using-membranes-to-recover-lithium-from-wastewater/#:~:text=The%20process%20uses%20a%20metal,involved%20in%20the%20research%2C%20explained)).  
• **Fluidized-bed granulation:** In pilot research, Li⁺ in effluents was crystallized as lithium phosphate granules in a fluidized reactor. A 2024 study successfully recovered Li₃PO₄ from process brines by adding phosphate and circulating the slurry, producing granules for safe disposal or reuse ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/6/603#:~:text=4)). Such granulation can immobilize Li in a solid without gypsum or high waste volume.  
• **Chemical co-precipitation:** To remediate magnesium/calcium, CO₂ or pH adjustment is used. Example: Thacker Pass circuit produces epsomite (MgSO₄·7H₂O) and precipitates remaining Mg²⁺ with Ca(OH)₂ as Mg(OH)₂ ([lithiumamericas.com](https://lithiumamericas.com/news/news-details/2018/Lithium-Americas-Announces-Preliminary-Feasibility-Study-Results-for-the-Thacker-Pass-Project-06-21-2018/default.aspx#:~:text=production%20process,reagents%20to%20precipitate%20magnesium%20hydroxide)), leaving a clean Li-rich filtrate. On a site level, one can bubble CO₂ into spent brine to deposit CaCO₃ and regenerate aquifer chemistry.  
• **Biotechnologies:** Though early-stage, microbes (e.g. extremophile algae or bacteria) can uptake Li. Engineered biofilters or constructed wetlands are being researched to trap Li from effluent. (For example, reports describe certain halophilic algae accumulating Li on their surfaces, enabling biomass harvesting.)  
• **Solidification and reuse:** Lithium-containing tailings (from brine ponds or mills) can be mixed with clays or cements to immobilize Li in situ. Some projects plan to re-flood spent evaporation ponds with treated water to reflocculate remaining salts. Others convert Li-bearing waste into value-added products (e.g. lye, boron fertilizers) – for instance Lithium Harvest’s pilot process claims to co-produce Li and boron fertilizers from wastewater.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is **scaling refined lithium output from domestic resources**. Despite abundant potential brine and clay deposits, efficient extraction/refinement methods are still emerging. In practice, the U.S./Allies lack large-scale lithium chemical plants: Albemarle recently shelved a planned $1.3 b refinery in South Carolina, citing oversupply and economics ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/albemarle-ceo-says-math-doesnt-work-us-lithium-refinery-project-2025-05-01/#:~:text=Albemarle%20Corporation%20has%20paused%20its,lithium%20supply%20chain%20and%20reduce)). Many U.S. projects rely on unproven Direct-Li extraction (DLE) pilots – Standard Lithium’s Arkansas works are still in demo phase ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/ab1f74c5-4b07-465f-aa1f-3bf89418ba87#:~:text=The%20U,Formation%20offers%20high%20lithium%20concentrations)). Until high-throughput DLE and commercial-grade carbonate/hydroxide refineries are in place (likely via new tech or strong subsidies), allied supply will remain constrained.  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
The main bottleneck is converting resource to product: **industrial-scale Li processing**. For example, Albemarle noted that without government support, building a U.S. lithium refinery “doesn’t make economic sense” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/albemarle-ceo-says-math-doesnt-work-us-lithium-refinery-project-2025-05-01/#:~:text=Albemarle%20Corporation%20has%20paused%20its,lithium%20supply%20chain%20and%20reduce)). Likewise, new extraction methods (CO₂ brine recovery, adsorption columns, etc.) are promising but not yet proven at mine scale ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/ab1f74c5-4b07-465f-aa1f-3bf89418ba87#:~:text=The%20U,Formation%20offers%20high%20lithium%20concentrations)). In short, until these technologies mature – particularly direct-extraction and dedicated refining plants – US/allied supply chains will struggle to match projected demand.
