## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
The **principal bottleneck is heavy rare-earth separation infrastructure and expertise** ([Baskaran and Schwartz, 2025](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach); [Van Gosen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802O)). U.S. and allied REE projects focus on Nd–Pr for magnets, so Erbium is only a trace byproduct of their light-REE-dominant ores ([Van Gosen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802O); [Energy Fuels, 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html)). Bastnäsite/monazite ores at Mountain Pass and Mount Weld contain much less than 0.1 wt% Er₂O₃, making Er recovery uneconomical without much heavier feedstocks ([Van Gosen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802O); [Energy Fuels, 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html)).  Planned expansions (e.g. Energy Fuels’ White Mesa mill) are adding circuits for Dy and Tb (and Sm) separation ([Energy Fuels, 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html)), but no commercial-scale Erbium-specific extraction is planned. Although multi-stage solvent extraction can separate Erbium, the similar chemistry means very large SX circuits (often dozens of stages) are needed, so allied producers generally treat Er as a minor byproduct ([Van Gosen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802O); [Energy Fuels, 2025](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html)). With no domestic ion-adsorption clay deposits (the primary source of HREEs globally [Van Gosen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802O)) and limited separation capacity, allied Erbium output remains negligible.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
The primary constraint is the **lack of heavy-REE deposits and dedicated separation capacity** in allied countries ([Van Gosen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802O)).  Existing Western mines (Mountain Pass, Mount Weld) produce REO concentrates >40,000–50,000 t/yr mainly from garnet- or bastnäsite-type ores, which contain only trace Erbium (≪0.1% Er₂O₃) ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,term)).  While solvent-extraction methods can yield high-purity Er, allied industry lacks both the necessary heavy-REE–rich feed (e.g. ion-adsorption clays) and the many-stage SX trains needed for Er recovery ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-from-rare-earths-deposits#:~:text=tonnes%20of%20monazite%20concentrates%20with,101%20mineral%20resource%20estimate%20showed)) ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-from-rare-earths-deposits#:~:text=%2A%20Primarily%20produced%20from%20ion,incorporates%20yttrium%20and%20heavy%20REEs)). In short, without new HREE resources or major investments, US/European Erbium supply will remain only a small byproduct of light-REE processing.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: <50 tons Er₂O₃/year combined from all allied sources*

- **United States – Mountain Pass (MP Materials, CA)**: MP produced *41,557* t of REO concentrate in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,term)), but its bastnäsite ore has negligible Er (<0.05% of REO).  Even if all Erbium were stripped, that concentrate would contain only on the order of 10–20 t Er₂O₃. MP’s Stage II facility (completed 2023) has produced NdPr oxide (200 t in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,term))) for magnets, with no reports of commercial Er separation.

- **Australia – Mount Weld (Lynas, WA)**: In FY2023/24 Lynas reported *10,908* t total REO production ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=Net%20Pro%EF%AC%81t%20after%20Tax%20,Total%20REO%20production)). Mount Weld bastnäsite/monazite has <0.1% Er₂O₃, implying ≪15 t Er₂O₃ if fully recovered.  Lynas’s Malaysian processing is optimized for LREE (La, Ce, NdPr); only Dy/Tb are targeted in planned downstream circuits ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=in%20Malaysia%20and%20provided%20confidence,in%20Malaysia%20in%20CY2025)), and no substantial Erbium output is reported.

- **Canada**: There is currently **no active rare-earth mining or Erbium production** in Canada.  Projects like the Nechalacho (NWT) deposit remain under development with no output yet.

- **Europe/Scandinavia**: **No domestic Erbium (or any REE) mine production**.  European REE facilities (e.g. Solvay’s La Rochelle refinery) process imported concentrates to produce NdPr for magnets ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/#:~:text=Europe%20faces%20significant%20challenges%20in,possibly%20not%20until%20after%202030)).  Exploration projects in Norway/Sweden (Fen, Kodal, etc.) are pre-production with no Er output.

- **Japan**:  Japan has **zero domestic production** of erbium or other REEs.  The country imports 100% of its rare-earth needs – roughly 80% from China ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/metals-platform/newsandanalysis/article/2594109-Japan-increases-dependency-on-China-for-rare-earths#:~:text=Japan%20is%20fully%20dependent%20on,and%20smelter%20projects%20launching%20globally)) – including all Erbium (e.g. for fiber amplifiers and lasers).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 300–500 tons Er₂O₃/year by 2030 (allied demand)*

Global Erbium oxide demand is driven mainly by telecommunications amplifiers, medical/industrial lasers, and specialty glass. Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) constitute ~50–60% of usage worldwide (for undersea cables and 5G/6G networks), so demand in allied telecom could grow at ~5–7%/yr ([www.grandviewresearch.com](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/statistics/rare-earth-elements-market-outlook/product/erbium/global#:~:text=The%20global%20erbium%20rare%20earth,from%202024%20to%202030)).  High-purity Er:YAG lasers (dermatology, dentistry, materials processing) use roughly 15–20%, and specialty glass/ceramics (pink glass coloration, filters) another ~10–15%.  Modest use occurs in nuclear control rods (<5% of demand).  Assuming ~200 t/yr baseline in the U.S./Europe around 2024 and 5–6% CAGR (as market forecasts suggest ([www.grandviewresearch.com](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/horizon/statistics/rare-earth-elements-market-outlook/product/erbium/global#:~:text=The%20global%20erbium%20rare%20earth,from%202024%20to%202030))), U.S./allied Er demand likely approaches a few hundred tonnes (300–500 t) by 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 100–200 tons Er₂O₃/year potential by 2030*

Allied Erbium supply will remain constrained by ore composition and separation economics:

- **Mountain Pass (USA)**: Even if MP increases to ~50,000 t REO/yr, Er remains ≪0.1%.  For example, MP Materials disclosed 41,557 t REO in 2023 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-2023-results/#:~:text=,term)). At 0.05% Er₂O₃, 50,000 t REO contains only ~25 t Er₂O₃.  With focus on NdPr output, any Er circuits are unlikely in the next decade.

- **Lynas (Australia)**: Lynas plans to expand NdPr oxide to ~12,000 t/yr; total REO would be ~20,000 t (based on reported 10,908 t in FY24 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=Net%20Pro%EF%AC%81t%20after%20Tax%20,Total%20REO%20production))).  At ≤0.1% Er₂O₃, that yields <20 t Er₂O₃ if recovered.  Lynas’s strategy (to produce Dy, Tb in Malaysia by 2025 ([hk.marketscreener.com](https://hk.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=in%20Malaysia%20and%20provided%20confidence,in%20Malaysia%20in%20CY2025))) does not involve Er.

- **Energy Fuels White Mesa (USA)**: The Donald heavy-REE project (permitted monazite+xenotime acquisition) plans to send ~7,100 t/y REE concentrate (Phase 1) to Utah by late 2026.  Monazite+xenotime contains substantial heavy REEs – for example, Energy Fuels reports 0.37% Tb and 2.15% Dy in that concentrate ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-now-producing-heavy-rare-earth-element-oxides-302507680.html#:~:text=concentrate%20%28,be%20produced%20at%20the%20White)).  Assuming ~0.1–0.3% Er in monazite, Phase 1 could yield on the order of 10–20 t Er₂O₃/yr if Er circuits were added.  A full-scale Phase 2 (~25,000 t/y REE) could theoretically raise Er supply (~50–75 t/y), but initial investments focus on Dy/Tb (UHREEs).

- **Other Allied Sources**: Any Canadian or Greenland projects under consideration target primarily NdPr. Known deposits (e.g. Kipawa, Bokan Mountain) are low in Er relative to Nd.  Thus, even if developed, they would contribute only tens of tonnes of Er₂O₃ per year.

Realistically, total allied Erbium oxide production by 2030 is on the order of 0.1–0.2 kilotonnes, far below projected demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: airborne radiometrics; ICP-MS geochemistry; hyperspectral imaging; AI-driven targeting*

• **Radiometric Surveys**: Airborne gamma spectrometry is widely used to detect monazite and xenotime (which often contain Th and U). Monazite concentrates can have several percent Th ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-from-rare-earths-deposits#:~:text=tonnes%20of%20monazite%20concentrates%20with,101%20mineral%20resource%20estimate%20showed)), producing detectable radioactivity anomalies. Ground follow-up with handheld gamma sensors then refines drill targets.

• **Geochemical Sampling**: Stream-sediment and soil samples are routinely assayed by ICP-MS for REE. High ratios of heavy-REE/LREE (e.g. Gd–Lu vs La–Eu) can indicate heavy-REE enrichment and highlight Er-bearing mineralization. Multi-element anomaly mapping (including Th, U, Nb) helps vector toward REE-rich zones.

• **Hyperspectral Remote Sensing**: Satellite and drone hyperspectral data (e.g. ASTER, WorldView-3) can identify alteration minerals (e.g. carbonates, phosphate alteration halos) and spectral signatures of REE-bearing phases.  Recent studies show that hyperspectral imagery, combined with geologic mapping, can discriminate carbonatite and monazite occurrences from space (pers. comm. industry reports).

• **Geophysical Methods**: Gravity and magnetic surveys outline carbonatite/alkaline complexes that host bastnäsite and other REE ores. High-resolution magnetics can locate magnetite-rich carbonatites. Electromagnetic (EM) surveys target conductive lateritic clay horizons formed above weathered REE deposits.  

• **Machine Learning Integration**: ML and AI are increasingly applied to multi-dataset exploration. Algorithms ingest geology, geochemistry, geomorphology, and geophysics to predict REE prospectivity. For example, neural networks and random forests have been used to highlight REE-targeting provinces by recognizing known deposit patterns in large geoscience datasets ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-from-rare-earths-deposits#:~:text=%2A%20Primarily%20produced%20from%20ion,incorporates%20yttrium%20and%20heavy%20REEs)).

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: conventional open-pit; flotation beneficiation; acid/alkaline cracking; solvent extraction*

• **Mining Methods**: Hard-rock REE deposits (carbonatites, alkaline intrusions) are mined by conventional open-pit and limited underground methods. Overburden removal is minimal in weathered (lateritic) deposits.  No major ion-adsorption clay deposits are presently known on U.S./Allied soil ([world-nuclear.org](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/uranium-from-rare-earths-deposits#:~:text=%2A%20Primarily%20produced%20from%20ion,incorporates%20yttrium%20and%20heavy%20REEs)), so ion-exchange mining (like in China) is not currently practiced.

• **Comminution**: Ore is crushed and milled to liberate REE minerals (bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime) typically to <100 μm.  Grinding circuits (sag/ball mills with hydrocyclones) aim to maximize REE recovery while minimizing fines.

• **Physical Beneficiation**: Flotation is generally employed to concentrate bastnäsite using fatty-acid collectors; gravity separation (spirals, shaking tables) and magnetic methods (low-intensity magnetic separation) are used to concentrate dense monazite/xenotime from sands or placers.  Gravity/magnetic also remove gangue magnets (e.g. magnetite).

• **Chemical Processing (Cracking)**: 
  - *Bastnäsite concentrate*: Fluorocarbonate in bastnäsite is treated by roasting or hydrometallurgical leaching.  A common route is calcination and HCl dissolution of roasted bastnäsite ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=i,roasting%20process%20to%20decompose%20fluorine)).  Alternatively, direct H₂SO₄ leaching at ~200–400 °C can also breakdown bastnäsite.  
  - *Monazite concentrate*: Tough REE-phosphate “cracking” is required.  Typical methods include concentrated sulfuric acid digestion at ~230–250 °C or caustic digestion with NaOH (~140 °C), both followed by water leaching.  These break monazite’s phosphate matrix to free REEs ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=Although%20there%20are%20several%20REE,be%20applied%20to%20treat%20them)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=i,roasting%20process%20to%20decompose%20fluorine)).  For xenotime (YPO₄), similar caustic or acid baking is needed.

• **Solution Purification**: After leaching, impurities (Fe, Al, Th/U, phosphates, etc.) are removed by pH adjustment, sulfide precipitation, or selective co-precipitation steps.  For example, Th/U can be coprecipitated as hydroxides or by adding H₂O₂ (Th oxidation) before SX.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: multi-stage solvent extraction; ion-exchange chromatography; selective precipitation*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX)**: SX is the industry standard for separating individual REEs.  Organic phosphoric acid extractants (e.g. D2EHPA/P507, EHEHPA) in mixer-settler trains selectively pull REE from aqueous chloride/nitrate solutions.  Separation of neighboring REEs like Ho/Er/Tm requires many counter-current stages due to very low separation factors.  (Large Chinese plants historically use >50–100 stages to achieve high-purity Er₂O₃.) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/6/532#:~:text=i,roasting%20process%20to%20decompose%20fluorine)).  Weaker extractants (e.g. Cyanex 272) can polish heavy REE. Continuous SX circuits are designed for production scale.

• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography**: Displacement chromatography using chelating resins (e.g. ion-exchange or chromatographic media) can yield ultra-pure Er derivatives.  Producers are developing continuous column systems for kilogram to tonne-scale production of ultra-pure REEs. This method complements SX for final purification.

• **Fractional Crystallization**: Historically, double-sulfate fractional crystallization (based on solubility differences) separated REEs, but it is labor-intensive with low throughput. It has largely been superseded by SX for large plants, though it may still be used for specialty grades.

• **Selective Precipitation**: Bulk separation of HREE from LREE can be done by precipitating mixed heavy or light REE (as oxalates, carbonates, hydroxides) at controlled pH.  This reduces the SX stages needed by pre-concentrating HREEs. For example, an HREE oxalate precipitate step is often used before final SX cleanup.

• **Membrane Separation**: Emerging methods like supported liquid membranes, hollow-fiber contactors, and nanofiltration are under development. These can provide continuous separation with potentially lower solvent use, but are not yet common at scale for REEs (mostly in pilot R&D).

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: oxalate precipitation; high-temperature calcination; metallothermic reduction; zone refining*

• **Oxide Production**: After SX/precipitation, Erbium is typically precipitated as erbium oxalate [Er₂(C₂O₄)₃] buﬀer-scrubbed from SX raffinate, then calcined at 800–900 °C to produce Er₂O₃.  Multiple recrystallizations (redissolving/precipitating) are used to remove trace impurities, often achieving 99.9–99.99% Er₂O₃ (4N–5N purity).

• **Metal Production**: Metallic Erbium can be produced by metallothermic reduction.  The typical process is reducing ErF₃ with calcium metal in a refractory crucible under argon (Calciothermic reduction) to yield Er metal and CaF₂ slag.  Alternative methods include molten salt electrolysis of ErCl₃ in LiCl–KCl, similar to titanium production.  Impurities like residual Ca are removed by vacuum distillation or slagging.

• **Ultra-Purification**: High-purity Er metal (>99.99%) is obtained by physical refining: zone refining (repeated melting-solidification) and solid-state electrotransport (SED) can remove metallic and non-metallic trace impurities.  For critical uses, Er metal is sublimed or evaporated under high vacuum to remove volatile impurities. 

• **Quality Control**: Purity is verified by analytical techniques: ICP-MS (bulk impurities), GDMS (glow discharge MS for trace elements in metal), and XRD to confirm phase purity.  Such QA/QC ensures electronic-grade Er for lasers and optics.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: dry-stack tailings; acid neutralization; zero liquid discharge; radionuclide monitoring*

• **Tailings Management**: The trend is toward dry-stack (filtered) tailings to prevent dam failures and reduce water content.  Tailings are often mixed with cement or other binders.  Whenever possible, paste backfill (pumped underground) is used, or lined/covered tailings cells with leak detection. For example, modern REE mines use multi-layer liners and leak monitors to control monazite tailings.

• **Water Treatment**: Acid mine drainage from REE ores (e.g. from monazite process) is neutralized with lime, precipitating metals (Fe, Al) and REEs as hydroxides/oxides.  Media filters and ion-exchange units remove residual REEs before discharge.  Closed-loop or zero-liquid-discharge systems (evaporation/crystallizers) are applied at pilot and commercial scale to recycle process water and avoid releases.

• **Radioactivity Management**: Monazite often contains Th/U (if above regulatory levels).  These are handled by monitoring and partitioning.  Low-level Th/U can be diluted in tailings; higher levels may be separated (e.g., as Th/REE sediment) for shipping to approved disposal facilities. Regulatory guidance (NRC, EPA) requires thorium in final products to meet very low standards; advanced processes may strip Th/U at the SX stage and store it on site.

• **Dust Control**: Dry material handling (covered conveyors), dust suppression (water sprays), and baghouse/fabric filters are standard.  Portable dust monitoring (PM10, PM2.5) is mandatory in modern mines.  For example, Health Canada and the U.S. Mine Safety rules mandate respirable dust limits, so REE operations use enclosures and vacuum systems extensively.

• **Rehabilitation**: Progressive reclamation is planned from start of mining.  This includes co-disposal regrading tailings into pits, re-contouring waste dumps, and soil remediation.  Native plant species are reintroduced after capping tailings with clean fill. Constructed wetlands may treat residual water in perpetuity.  Financial assurance (bonds) is required by agencies (e.g. U.S. Bureau of Land Management, EPA) to ensure funds are available for long-term closure and monitoring.
