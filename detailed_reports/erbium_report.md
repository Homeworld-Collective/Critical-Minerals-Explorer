## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States – Mountain Pass (MP Materials, CA)**: The only active US rare‐earth mine is Mountain Pass. In 2024 MP delivered **~45,000 t of REO in concentrate** ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)). Erbium (a heavy REE) is only a minor component of this output. MP’s ore is bastnäsite (light REE–dominant) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=The%20REE%20group%20includes%2017,minerals%20in%20which%20LREE%20dominate)), so Erbium oxide content is on the order of a few percent of the total. (For reference, MP’s midstream separation in 2024 yielded ~1,300 t NdPr oxide plus byproducts ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).)  
• **Australia – Mount Weld (Lynas, WA)**: Lynas produced **10,908 t of total rare-earth oxide (REO)** in FY2023-24 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)) (down from 16,780 t in FY2022-23). This REO contains Erbium at a few-percent level (monazite/bastnäsite mix). Lynas is expanding capacity (targeting 10,500 t NdPr oxide per year by late 2024 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=The%20company%20conducted%20the%20shutdown,December))), which implies correspondingly higher Erbium output (perhaps ~200–300 t Er₂O₃/yr once expanded).  
• **Canada**: No active Erbium (REE) mining. Historical projects (e.g. Nechalacho, Strange Lake) remain in development/publications, but no production. Canada’s demand (telecom, sensors) is met by imports.  
• **EU/Norway/Iceland**: Essentially zero domestic mining of Erbium. European activities focus on refining or magnet fabrication (e.g. Solvay’s NdFeB plant in Belgium, but Solvay’s focus is Nd-Dy magnets and does not separately report Er〔no direct export data〕). Norway/Iceland have exploration, but no Erbium production yet. All Erbium oxide must be imported (often from US/AU concentrates via third countries).  
• **Japan**: No domestic production. Japan’s Erbium consumption (telecom fibers, lasers) comes entirely from imports of Er₂O₃/Er-doped fibers (often sourced via scrap or processed materials from North America/Australia).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Erbium demand in US/allied countries will be driven largely by **fiber-optic telecommunications, laser systems, and nuclear technologies**. No public official projection for Erbium exists, but sector growth provides guidance. For example, fiber-optic amplifiers consume ~70% of global Erbium now ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/erbium-metal-market/#:~:text=In%20%2A%2Atelecommunications%2A%2A%2C%20erbium,to%20ensure%20seamless%20transcontinental%20connectivity)). Global EDFA demand is growing ~8–10%/yr ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/erbium-metal-market/#:~:text=In%20%2A%2Atelecommunications%2A%2A%2C%20erbium,to%20ensure%20seamless%20transcontinental%20connectivity)), propelled by 5G networks and undersea cables (e.g. Google’s Dunant, Meta’s 2Africa). If global Erbium usage (~2–3 kt today) grows at ~8%/yr, 2030 global Er demand could reach ~3–4 kt. Allied nations (US, EU, Japan, Canada, Australia) account for roughly half of global telecom infrastructure and a large share of medical/defense uses. Conservatively, allied Erbium demand in 2030 may be on the order of **1,500–2,500 t**. (By analogy, the IEA projects total REE demand ~134,000 t by 2030 ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/rare-earth-elements#:~:text=Cleantech%20demand%20%28kt%29%20%20,121)); if Erbium is ~2% of REE mass, that implies ~2,700 t Er globally by 2030, with allied share ≈1–2 kt.) Key end-users:  
- **Telecommunications**: Er-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) in North America, Europe, Japan. (70% of Er use ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/erbium-metal-market/#:~:text=In%20%2A%2Atelecommunications%2A%2A%2C%20erbium,to%20ensure%20seamless%20transcontinental%20connectivity)); demand ~9% CAGR through 2030.) Allied investment in 5G/6G means continuous growth.  
- **Lasers (Er:YAG, fiber lasers)**: Medical and industrial lasers use high-purity Er. Allied medical device production and defense (rangefinders/targeting) will require steady Er shipments ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/erbium-metal-market/#:~:text=Applications%20in%20%2A%2Ahigh,influencing%20rare%20earth%20metal%20procurement)).  
- **Nuclear sector**: Erbium nitrate or oxide rods are used as neutron absorbers in some reactor designs. With allied nuclear reactor builds (e.g. US SMRs, Japan’s advanced designs), benign growth (perhaps single-digit %/yr) in Erbium-nitrate demand may occur ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/erbium-metal-market/#:~:text=The%20,generation%20molten%20salt%20reactors)).  

No single source quotes “2030 demand,” but these industry growth figures and the IEA outlook ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/rare-earth-elements#:~:text=Cleantech%20demand%20%28kt%29%20%20,121)) support a multiple-ton-needs scale. Allied consumption will far exceed the current small-scale separated Er production, implying heavy reliance on expanded supply (see below).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
By 2030 allied Erbium supply will come from scaling current mines and new projects:  
• **Mountain Pass (USA)** – Stage II processing (completed 2023) fully separates NdPr, Ce, La, etc. Erbium from MP concentrate will continue as a byproduct. Stage III (magnet production) is targeting NdPr metals, but Er₍₂₎O₃ output remains tied to Stage II concentrate flow ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=implementing%20Stage%20I%2C%20which%20was,suppressed%20and%20disposed%20as%20tailings)). Assuming MP operates ~45 kt REO/yr (consistent with recent record output ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products))) and Erbium is ~2% of that, ~900 t Er₂O₃/yr could be available by 2030 (pending Stage III magnets ramp).  
• **Lynas (Australia)** – With expansion to ~10.5 kt NdPr oxide/yr ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=The%20company%20conducted%20the%20shutdown,December)) (implying ~15 kt REO/yr total), Erbium portion might be ~200–300 t Er₂O₃/yr by 2030. These Er-bearing concentrates are largely shipped abroad (Lynas’s Malaysian refinery) but count as allied (Australia) supply. Lynas’s planned Kalgoorlie plant (WA) will increase domestic processing but not additional primary output.  
• **Donald Project / White Mesa (US)** – Starting ~2026, Energy Fuels’ Donald JV in Australia will send **~7,000–8,000 t REE concentrate**/yr (Phase 1) to Utah ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-06-25-Energy-Fuels-Donald-Rare-Earth-and-Mineral-Sand-Joint-Venture-in-Australia-Receives-Final-Major-Regulatory-Approvals#:~:text=Phase%201%20of%20the%20Donald,1%20quantities%20of%20REEC%20into)). That is ~4,700 t TREO, of which heavy REEs (like Dy, Tb–and smaller Er amounts) will be separated at White Mesa. If Erbium is, e.g., ~2% of the 4,700 t, that adds ~90 t Er₂O₃/yr. Phase 2 (planned) would process 50,000 t monazite/yr (25,000 t TREO) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1385849/000138584925000027/efr-20250630.htm#:~:text=The%20Phase%202%20REE%20separation,due%20to%20its%20importance%20in)) – yielding ~1,000+ t Er if scaled. In total, White Mesa Phase 2 could supply **hundreds of tonnes of Er₂O₃ annually** (in mixed “heavy RE” products).  
• **Other Allied Sources** – Unlikely before 2030. (Greenland’s Kvanefjeld, Norway’s Fen/Evenes are still years from FID.) Canada’s potential heavy-mineral sands (e.g. NAL, PLS) might contribute trace Er, but none are yet producing. Japan and EU plan no primary mines; they may scale recycling (e.g. Er from vitrified glass waste) but this is minimal so far.  

Summing, allied Erbium supply in 2030 might reach on the order of **1,000–2,500 t/yr**, combining tailgas from NdPr-focused mines (MP, Lynas) and new heavy‐feed operations (Donald/White Mesa). The cited projects ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-06-25-Energy-Fuels-Donald-Rare-Earth-and-Mineral-Sand-Joint-Venture-in-Australia-Receives-Final-Major-Regulatory-Approvals#:~:text=Phase%201%20of%20the%20Donald,1%20quantities%20of%20REEC%20into)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1385849/000138584925000027/efr-20250630.htm#:~:text=The%20Phase%202%20REE%20separation,due%20to%20its%20importance%20in)) indicate multi-kilotonne rare-earth concentrates by 2030; Erbium’s share is a few percent of those flows.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys**: Airborne/ground gamma-ray spectrometry detects U/Th-bearing minerals often associated with monazite-type REE deposits ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=%2A%20Gamma,in%20radioactive%20rare%20earth%20elements)). Elevated natural gamma can flag heavy-REE potential (Erbium often coexists with thorium in placers).  
• **Geochemical Sampling**: Systematic soil, stream-sediment and rock-sample analyses (ICP-MS, XRF) highlight REE anomalies. For example, high Ce/La plus HREE signatures in lateritic soils or clays can pinpoint Erbium-rich laterite deposits. Soil B-horizon and saprolite samples are commonly assayed ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Sample%20types%3A)).  
• **Geophysical Surveys**: Airborne magnetics and gravity mapping delineate carbonatite/alkaline intrusions (like MP) or associated structures ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Magnetic%20and%20Gravity%20Surveys)). Magnetic surveys sense mafic probes (bastnäsite often in magnetic fluorspar veins); gravity and EM can outline dense resistant plugs. Ground EM/neutron logs may detect clay-hosted ion-adsorption zones (rare in allies).  
• **Remote Sensing**: Satellite/airborne hyperspectral and multispectral imaging (ASTER, Sentinel) identify pathfinder minerals (phosphates, carbonates) and alteration halos above REE systems ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Satellite%20and%20aerial%20imagery%20analysis%3A)). LiDAR topography reveals geomorphic clues to mineralized weathering. GIS-based targeting combines these data with geologic maps to highlight prospects ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Integration%20with%20Geographic%20Information%20Systems,GIS)).  
• **Biogeochemical Prospecting**: Certain plants (e.g. shrubs or ferns) bioaccumulate HREEs from soil. Analysis of vegetation (leaves, bark) by ICP-MS can serve as “green” geochemical samplers for buried Erbium anomalies ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=Plant%20sampling%20and%20analysis%3A)). This method helps detect deep or covered mineralization.  
• **Data Analytics (AI/ML)**: Machine-learning models ingest geologic, geochemical and geophysical data to predict REE deposits ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/rare-earth-prospecting-techniques/#:~:text=,imagery%20and%20remote%20sensing%20data)). Pattern-recognition algorithms on multi-layer surveys can flag subtle Erbium hotspots that traditional methods might miss. AI tools are increasingly used to prioritize drill targets across large terrains.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit/Surface Mining**: Standard for carbonatite/bastnäsite (e.g. MP) and ion-adsorption deposits. Heavy earth-moving (blasting, haul trucks) removes ore. Project design (strip ratio, waste management) is critical for large complexes like MP.  
• **Crushing/Grinding**: High-pressure roll crushers and mills (SAG, ball) reduce ore to fine (50–200 μm) slurries for beneficiation ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=implementing%20Stage%20I%2C%20which%20was,suppressed%20and%20disposed%20as%20tailings)). Optimization of grind size is needed to liberate Er-containing minerals (monazite, xenotime).  
• **Flotation/Gravity Separation**: Froth flotation separates REE-bearing minerals (e.g. bastnäsite, allanite) from gangue ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=implementing%20Stage%20I%2C%20which%20was,suppressed%20and%20disposed%20as%20tailings)). Dense-media or spirals concentrate heavy minerals (ilmenite, monazite) in sand deposits. For example, MP uses froth flotation to recover bastnäsite in its concentrate ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=implementing%20Stage%20I%2C%20which%20was,suppressed%20and%20disposed%20as%20tailings)).  
• **Roasting & Acid Leaching (Monazite)**: Enormous allied monazite resources (e.g. Donald Project) require high-temperature crack leach. At White Mesa Mill, monazite is “cracked” with concentrated H₂SO₄ (or NaOH roast) to break down the phosphate matrix ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1385849/000138584925000027/efr-20250630.htm#:~:text=as%20well%20as%20to%20install,typical%20Colorado%20Plateau%20uranium%20deposits)). The REEs (incl. Er) then enter solution for further recovery; uranium byproduct is sold.  
• **Solvent Stripping & Product Finishing**: After leaching, Erbium (as Er³⁺) is separated from solution and precipitated (as oxalate or fluoride) then calcined to Er₂O₃. The final product quality hinges on removal of impurities (e.g. Y, LREE) during these steps.  
• **Water & Reagent Recycling**: Advanced allied mines emphasize recycling to reduce waste. For example, MP Materials uses dry-stack tailings and a closed-circuit water system, recycling ~95% of process water ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20believes%20it%20is,The%20Company%E2%80%99s%20tailings%20and%20concentrate)). This not only conserves water but also minimizes Er losses to effluents (Erbium dissolved in tailing water is recaptured).  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX)**: The industry-standard for REE separation. In SX, Erbium (Er³⁺) is partitioned from co-REEs using organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, Versatic acid, Cyanex 272) in counter-current mixer-settler trains. Allied refiners (e.g. MP Stage-II, Lynas) use SX flowsheets to first strip out Ce/La then sequentially pull off NdPr, Sm, etc. (Er is recovered in heavier lanthanide circuits). Each extraction stage can be tuned (acid concentration, temperature) to optimize Erv(III) selectivity.  
• **Ion-Exchange/Chromatography**: Fixed-bed resin columns (e.g. TrisKem® LN resin, SRE™ products) are emerging for fine-purification. These use sulfonated polystyrene or HDEHP-impregnated polymers to selectively adsorb individual lanthanides. For example, supported liquid-membrane and resin technologies can achieve high Er/Ho separation (critical for laser-grade Er) ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c03268#:~:text=system%20of%20REEs%20using%20hollow,extractant%20since%20this%20increases%20the)). In practice, large-scale Allied use is limited, but pilot plants exist.  
• **Precipitation Approaches**: Double-salt precipitation (e.g. La/Er double sulfates or oxalates) can crudely separate groups of REE. For instance, Erbium often co-precipitates with Holmium in certain sulfate schemes, then separated by subsequent SX or ion-exchange. These classical hydrometallurgical methods augment SX to reduce load.  
• **Pyro-Electrochemical**: The FFC Cambridge process and related molten-salt electrolysis can reduce Er₂O₃ directly to Er metal in a chloride bath. Similarly, calciothermic reduction (ErF₃ + Ca → Er metal) is used industrially. These are more “refinement” than initial separation, but can be integral (e.g. producing 99.9% Er metal after SX).  
• **Fluorination**: A niche lab technique: Erbium can be volatile as ErF₃ at high temperature. In theory, fluorination can refine erbium by differential volatility, but this is mainly experimental.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Oxide Production (Er₂O₃)**: After chemical separation, purified Er is typically precipitated as oxalate or hydroxide, then **calcined** (>700 °C) to erbium oxide. Suppliers (American Elements, Treibacher) use multistage purification (re-precipitation, dissolution) to reach 99.99% Er₂O₃. Quality control (ICP-MS assays) ensures removal of Th, U and neighboring REE (Tm, Yb).  
• **Erbium Metal Production**:  High-purity (4N–5N) Erbium metal is produced by **electrolytic reduction** of ErCl₃ in molten LiCl-KCl (at ~700°C). Alternatively, **calciothermic reduction** is used: Er₂O₃ or ErF₃ is mixed with Ca and heated in a sealed crucible to yield Er metal ingots. The metal then undergoes vacuum induction melting/refining to remove Ca and other residuals. (For example, *Kyowa Lenko* and *Shin-Etsu* use such methods to make Er metal for fiber lasers.)  
• **Alloying and Magnet Fabrication**: Although pure Er metal demand is smaller, Erbium oxide is sometimes alloyed (e.g. with vanadium or iron) for specialized magnets or nuclear control rods. Refiners ensure ultra-low oxygen and alkali levels (using fluxing agents, multiple melts).  
• **Crystal Growth (Lasers/Fibers)**: For optical uses, Er-doped crystals (YAG, ZBLAN) are grown by techniques like Czochralski pull. Extremely pure Er₂O₃ powder is doped into the host melt or fiber preform. Maintaining optical-grade purity (<1 ppm impurities) is a bottleneck; for example, vacuum processing and electrophoresis are needed to eliminate scattering centers.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Management – Dry Stacking**: Modern RE mines (e.g. MP) use filtered tailings to avoid aqueous ponds. Dry-stack technology minimizes seepage of Erbium-bearing fines. MP Materials recycles ~95% of its process water in a closed loop ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=The%20Company%20believes%20it%20is,The%20Company%E2%80%99s%20tailings%20and%20concentrate)), greatly reducing effluent discharge. This dramatically lowers Erbium lost to waste water.  
• **Chemical Neutralization**: Waste sulfuric or hydrochloric acid from monazite leaching is treated (neutralized with lime/NaOH) and recycled. Metals (Zn, Fe) and Th/U precipitate out. Neutralization columns and iron coprecipitation extract radionuclides before any discharge.  
• **Heavy-Metal Capture**: Ion-exchange or adsorption filters can scrub dissolved Er and other REEs from effluents. Media like MnO₂ pellets or activated carbon impregnated with phosphates trap lanthanides in closed-loop plants. Any Erbium captured is returned to processing.  
• **Phytoremediation/Biostabilization**: Certain plants (e.g. Willey’s reed, Sorghum) can uptake HREE from soil. Tailings storage facilities may use such vegetation covers (also preventing erosion). Harvested biomass could be processed to recover trace Erbium, though this is more theoretical.  
• **Reagent Recycling/Destruction**: Spent organic SX reagents are burnt in dedicated incinerators (destroying carbon tet cycles) or stripped and reused. By recovering/reusing solvents, allied operations both cut costs and prevent organic waste containing Er-chelates.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
Allied Erbium production is presently **limited by heavy‐REE processing capability**. Existing Western facilities (Mountain Pass, Lynas) emphasize Nd-Pr magnets, with Erbium recovered only as a minor byproduct ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=implementing%20Stage%20I%2C%20which%20was,suppressed%20and%20disposed%20as%20tailings)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)). The planned Donald Project feed and White Mesa expansions will introduce dedicated heavy-REE circuits, but these mainly target Dy/Tb first ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-06-25-Energy-Fuels-Donald-Rare-Earth-and-Mineral-Sand-Joint-Venture-in-Australia-Receives-Final-Major-Regulatory-Approvals#:~:text=Phase%201%20of%20the%20Donald,1%20quantities%20of%20REEC%20into)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1385849/000138584925000027/efr-20250630.htm#:~:text=The%20Phase%202%20REE%20separation,due%20to%20its%20importance%20in)). In effect, **commercial-scale Erbium separation and refining infrastructure is still nascent** in the US/allies. Key technology constraints include scarcity of proven solvent-extraction flowsheets for Er-rich streams and a lack of large-scale Er-specific processing lines, making high-purity Erbium largely dependent on future projects.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The principal bottleneck is **heavy rare-earth separation**. U.S. and allied projects are currently optimizing for NdPr (magnet elements), so Erbium (a heavier lanthanide) remains only a secondary output ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136823000009/mp-20221231.htm#:~:text=implementing%20Stage%20I%2C%20which%20was,suppressed%20and%20disposed%20as%20tailings)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)). Planned facilities (e.g. Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Phase 2) will add Dy/Tb circuitry ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1385849/000138584925000027/efr-20250630.htm#:~:text=The%20Phase%202%20REE%20separation,due%20to%20its%20importance%20in)), but tailored Erbium recovery lags. In summary, without dedicated Erbium processing lines (advanced SX or chromatographic systems), allied Erbium supply growth is constrained, relying on byproduct streams from NdPr-focused operations ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-06-25-Energy-Fuels-Donald-Rare-Earth-and-Mineral-Sand-Joint-Venture-in-Australia-Receives-Final-Major-Regulatory-Approvals#:~:text=Phase%201%20of%20the%20Donald,1%20quantities%20of%20REEC%20into)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1385849/000138584925000027/efr-20250630.htm#:~:text=The%20Phase%202%20REE%20separation,due%20to%20its%20importance%20in)).
