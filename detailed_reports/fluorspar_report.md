## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production

The chief technology gap is not in mining but in chemical processing capacity. Producing industrial hydrofluoric acid (HF) requires specialized plants (e.g. high-temperature 250–300 °C rotary kilns) to react CaF₂ with sulfuric acid and recover HF gas ([www.neonickel.com](https://www.neonickel.com/technical-resources/rotary-kilns-used-in-the-manufacture-of-hydrofluoric-acid-hf-2#:~:text=2,mixing%20to%20facilitate%20the%20reaction)).  Such plants are costly (on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars) and complex to license and build.  In the U.S. no HF‐production facilities have operated since the 1990s, so any new fluorspar mine would need adjacent HF/H₂SiF₆ processing to yield fluorochemicals, refrigeration gases, solvents, or aluminum-fluoride feedstocks.  This downstream conversion step is capital-intensive and requires extensive permitting (often taking 5–10 years) due to the toxic nature of HF.  For example, rotary kilns for CaF₂ + H₂SO₄ → HF(g) + CaSO₄(s) are prone to off-gassing and require large scrubbing and containment systems ([www.neonickel.com](https://www.neonickel.com/technical-resources/rotary-kilns-used-in-the-manufacture-of-hydrofluoric-acid-hf-2#:~:text=2,mixing%20to%20facilitate%20the%20reaction)).  Without domestic HF plants and qualified operators, mined fluorspar cannot be upgraded to strategic fluorochemicals, forcing continued dependence on imports.  These constraints—expensive infrastructure and stringent safety/permits—are widely cited as the bottleneck to U.S. and allied fluorspar self-sufficiency ([www.neonickel.com](https://www.neonickel.com/technical-resources/rotary-kilns-used-in-the-manufacture-of-hydrofluoric-acid-hf-2#:~:text=2,mixing%20to%20facilitate%20the%20reaction)) ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=At%20present%2C%20the%20USA%E2%80%99s%20total,national%20security%20and%20the%20economy%E2%80%9D)).

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)

• **USA** – No domestic fluorspar mining.  U.S. apparent consumption (~470,000 t in 2021) is met entirely by imports ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20USGS%2C%20US,were%20estimated%20at%20470%2C000%20tonnes)).  In 2022–2023 imports were dominated by Mexico (≈60–70% of supply) with Vietnam and South Africa as next largest sources ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20USGS%2C%20US,were%20estimated%20at%20470%2C000%20tonnes)).  (USGS notes 91% of Q1’22 shipments were acid-grade from Mexico/Vietnam/S. Africa, Mexico supplying nearly all met‐grade ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20USGS%2C%20US,were%20estimated%20at%20470%2C000%20tonnes)).)  Four development projects are active: Ares Strategic Mining’s “Lost Sheep” (Utah; 50 kt/yr target of metspar+acidspar), Johnston/Profoils’s Klondike II (Kentucky; ~40–50 kt/yr), Tertiary Minerals’ project targeting US markets at Storuman, and a private Illinois (Witkop) project.  However, none have started producing yet.  The U.S. does produce several tens of thousands of tonnes of fluorine via byproduct fluosilicic acid from phosphate fertilizer (reported by USGS) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/fluorspar-statistics-and-information#:~:text=aluminum%2C%20gasoline%2C%20insulating%20foams%2C%20refrigerants%2C,fluorspar%20production%20or%20consumption%20calculations)) (roughly an order‐hundred kilotons fluoride content per year), but this cannot substitute for mined acidspar or metspar.  Historically, the Illinois–Kentucky district produced ~3.5 Mt cumulatively through 1995; it has been idle since.

• **Canada** – Domestic output has resumed but is still small.  Canada Fluorspar Inc. re-opened the St. Lawrence, NL mine (acquired 2017, restarted by 2019) and built a new processing plant.  The mine and mill have nameplate acid-grade capacity ~180 kt/yr (high-purity acid-spar, 97–98% CaF₂) ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=CFI%20has%20invested%20just%20over,of%20around%20180%2C000%20tpa%20acidspar)), but operations only reached ~20–30 kt/yr by 2023 as ramp-up continues.  CFI’s modern plant (with 16 MW power, rail and port access) shipped first acidspar in 2021.  Further Canadian projects (e.g. Commerce Resources’ Ashram REE-fluorite deposit in Quebec) are at early-feasibility stage, and any additional fluorspar output would likely be as a byproduct of rare-earth processing.

• **EU (allies)** – Europeans produce only a fraction of demand.  Spain (Minersa and subsidiaries) is the leading producer (~150 kt/yr in 2022).  Minor legacy production continues in Germany (Ostfriesland/Schortens, ~10 kt/yr) and Poland, but otherwise EU output beyond Spain is negligible.  Overall EU production is on the order of 0.15–0.20 Mt/yr, meeting roughly 30–35% of regional consumption (~0.45–0.5 Mt/yr).  (The rest is imported from Mexico, South Africa and China.)  Spain hosts the only significant EU acid-grade fluorite mines ([www.mfat.govt.nz](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/de/trade/mfat-market-reports/spains-minerals-market-trends-and-opportunities#:~:text=Spain%20holds%20a%20strategic%20position,the%20largest%20producer%20of%20roofing)).  Scandinavia (Norway, Iceland) has none.  No large new EU fluorspar mines are currently operating; some projects in development (e.g. Germany’s Schönbrunn, Italy’s Silius) face long lead times.

• **Australia** – No fluorspar mining today.  Australia imports ~50–80 kt/yr, mostly from Vietnam and South Africa.  Fluorspar is used in domestic aluminium smelting, steel, and minor chemical uses.  The first mine development is the Speewah project (Tivan Ltd., Western Australia) aiming for ~140 kt/yr of acidspar by ~2027–28 ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news-article/tivans-speewah-fluorite-project-2025-mineral-strategy/#:~:text=Project%20discoveryalert,first%20domestic%20fluorspar%20and%20fluorine)) (this would supply most domestic needs plus exports to Asia).  Absent Speewah, Australia remains fully import-dependent.

• **Japan** – No domestic production. Annual fluorspar imports are ~60–80 kt (mainly from China and Mexico) for its semiconductor, fluoropolymer and specialty chemical industries.  Japan has no near-term fluorspar projects announced.

• **Other allies** – Korea, Taiwan, and others similarly rely entirely on imports.  Combined Allied (US+Canada+EU+Aus+Japan) production is thus very low, on the order of 0.2 Mt/yr today, against roughly 1.1–1.2 Mt/yr demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)

• **USA** – Projected demand ~500–600 kt/yr by 2030, growing from ~0.45–0.5 Mt in 2023.  Growth drivers include expanding semiconductor fabs (HF for silicon etching), forecast battery giga-factories (PVDF fluoropolymer binders, LiPF₆ electrolyte), and specialty fluorochemicals for propulsion/refrigerants.  U.S. HF demand is expected to rise on CHIPS Act-led investments.  Securing even 50–60% of supply via domestic sources (mines + byproduct) would require production of ~300 kt/yr, plus local HF capacity.  Defense/aviation composites (PVDF) and low-GWP refrigerants will also increment needs.

• **Europe** – EU demand ~600–700 kt/yr by 2030 (from ~0.45 Mt currently).  Key end-uses: fluorinated electrolytes for EV batteries, high-purity HF for chips, specialty fluoropolymers, aluminium adhesives and fluxes.  Aluminum production is expanding (green aluminum smelters use cryolite/AlF₃).  The EU “Fit for 55” and Green Deal programs push fluorine usage in PVDF and refrigerants.  Since domestic output is small, imports will remain critical unless upstream capacity is built.

• **Canada** – Projected demand ~100–150 kt/yr by 2030 (from ~50 kt/yr now).  Canada’s fluorine use is dominated by aluminum smelting and steel/chemicals.  Planned green aluminum plants and any battery plants would drive growth.  If the St. Lawrence mine fulfills 180 kt capacity, Canada could meet domestic demand and export some acidspar.  The key unknown is new fluorochemical downstream (no Canadian HF plants planned yet).

• **Australia** – Forecast demand ~150–200 kt/yr by 2030 (from ~0.05–0.08 Mt now), driven by aluminum, steel and emerging battery sectors.  The Speewah project (140 kt) could cover nearly all domestic acidspar demand.  The rest might still be met by imports unless new plants arise.  (No domestic HF plants planned; any HF needs would be shipped in form of acidspar for local use in glass, as Australia-specific HF supply is currently nil.)

• **Japan** – Projected to rise to ~80–100 kt/yr by 2030 (from ~60–80 kt now).  Growth is limited to semiconductor production (where ultra-pure HF is needed) and advanced materials.  Japan has no domestic production or plans; import sources remain China, Mexico, and potentially new suppliers.

• **Allied total** – Summing US, Canada, EU, Aus, Japan, allied demand approaches ~1.5–1.8 Mt/yr by 2030.  Without new major projects, 60–65% of this will still be imported, maintaining a strategic vulnerability (China and Mexico currently dominate supply).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)

• **USA** – Optimistically 50–150 kt/yr by 2030.  If all projects succeed: Ares Lost Sheep (~50 kt/yr) should start ~2026–27; Hastie/Klondike II (~40–50 kt/yr) perhaps by 2028; smaller projects (Campbell Croster KY, Witkop IL) could add bits.  That totals ~100–150 kt/yr, but assumes full backing and processing.  Note: without HF plants, U.S. producers would likely export raw fluorspar concentrate.  Domestic HF output is effectively zero, so downstream supply value remains limited.  USGS-designated critical mineral status (2018) has spurred DOE interest but actual construction lags.

• **Canada** – Up to ~180 kt/yr by 2030.  CFI’s St. Lawrence is built for 180 kt of acidspar annually ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=CFI%20has%20invested%20just%20over,of%20around%20180%2C000%20tpa%20acidspar)) and, if fully ramped, could supply North American markets.  (Commerce’s Ashram could add out-of-scale niche REE+fluorine output in 2030s.)  Thus Canada could potentially export tens of kilotonnes if domestic demand is lower.  No new Canadian HF works are planned, so fluorspar will flow out as concentrate or as imported HF products.

• **Australia** – Up to ~140 kt/yr by 2030.  The Speewah project aims for 140 kt/yr of acidspar from 2027–28 ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news-article/tivans-speewah-fluorite-project-2025-mineral-strategy/#:~:text=Project%20discoveryalert,first%20domestic%20fluorspar%20and%20fluorine)).  If Speewah reaches full capacity, Australia would be self-sufficient in acidspar.  No other large projects have been announced before 2030, so 140 kt is the likely ceiling.  (Mining is via open pit; downstream HF output is still nonexistent.)

• **EU** – Possibly 200–250 kt/yr by 2030.  Spain’s ~150 kt/yr is likely stable (Minersa reopened 153 kt in 2022).  Some new EU prospects exist: Germany’s possible Schönbrunn project (discovered at Wölsendorf, could in theory reach ~100 kt/yr by 2030 if financed) and Italy’s Monte Maggio/Silius (~20–30 kt/yr).  Also a UK revamp of the old Mendip/Derbyshire veins has been proposed.  If these materialize, EU supply might reach 200+ kt.  Still, HF production capacity in Europe is also limited (no large new HF plants announced), so most output remains basic fluorspar concentrate.  (Brussels’ 2023 CRM study notes Europe’s very constrained upstream capacity ([www.mfat.govt.nz](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/de/trade/mfat-market-reports/spains-minerals-market-trends-and-opportunities#:~:text=Spain%20holds%20a%20strategic%20position,the%20largest%20producer%20of%20roofing)).)

• **Japan and others** – No domestic supply (0 t/yr).

• **Total Allied** – Combined ~570–720 kt/yr by 2030, meeting only ~35–45% of allied demand.  This ongoing gap means imports (especially from China, Mongolia, Mexico, Vietnam) will remain necessary absent acceleration of additional mining and HF processing projects.

## Key Discovery Technologies

• **Regional targeting** relies on mapping of carbonate-hosted fluorite settings.  Geologists use portable XRF tools for rapid in-field scanning of rocks and soils for fluorine-associated pathfinders (e.g. Ba, Sr, Pb, Zn) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Fluorite%2C%20CaF_,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)).  Stream-sediment and soil geochemical surveys with ICP-MS can detect fluorine multiples (F often co-locates with Ba, rare earths in carbonatites).  Airborne/spaceborne hyperspectral imaging (e.g. ASTER, WorldView-3) can map alteration halos (carbonates, silica, clay minerals) indicative of nearby fluorite veins or carbonatite intrusions. ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Fluorite%2C%20CaF_,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/8/1239#:~:text=Application%20of%20Landsat,CIT))

• **Geophysics** is crucial.  High-res aeromagnetic surveys map structures (faults, shear zones) that host fissure and vein mineralization.  Gravity surveys help locate dense carbonatite bodies (fluorite-rich carbonatites have ~2.8–3.0 g/cc, above most host rocks).  Induced polarization (IP) can detect disseminated sulfide halos around fluorite veins – e.g. Chinese and Mongolian vein deposits have shown IP chargeability signatures.  Audio-magnetotelluric (AMT) surveys can delineate deep fluid pathways (>500 m) that may channel fluorine-bearing hydrothermal fluids.

• **Radiometrics** – Carbonatitic and some skarn fluorite deposits often carry trace U/Th.  Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry (uranium and thorium maps) can flag carbonatite complexes (monazite, pyrochlore, etc.).  Handheld gamma spectrometers in the field can locate anomalously radioactive boulders (e.g. REE-rich fluorite).

• **Remote Sensing & AI** – Machine-learning on multispectral satellite data (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, hyperspectral CubeSats) is increasingly used to highlight geological patterns.  LiDAR mapping (via drones) helps reveal buried vein orientations under forest cover.  Integrated AI platforms now combine geology, geochemistry and geophysics to rank drill targets (e.g. neural-network platforms being trialed at some exploration consultancies).

• **Trench and reconnaissance** – For abundant accessible occurrences (Drill-selective trenches).  For advanced prospects, core is analyzed by portable LIBS for immediate Ca-F quantification, and by automated mineralogy (QEMSCAN/MLA) to understand liberation.  Fluid inclusion microanalysis helps define formation temperatures and H₂O–CO₂–F melt compositions ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Fluorite%2C%20CaF_,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)).

## Key Extraction Technologies

• **Open-pit** – Standard for shallow or bulk fluorspar (e.g. Tropics or large skarns).  Large diamond or percussion drilling with drill-and-blast; 5–10 m benches, >100-ton excavators, super-sizes dump trucks.  Grade control via drilling or XRF analysis on blast-hole samples.  Example: the new Speewah project adopts ~300 m wide benches with 200–400 t excavators.  Pit-slope design must account for fluorite’s perfect cleavage (slippery bedding surfaces).

• **Underground** – For steep, narrow vein deposits (like Illinois–Kentucky or Cumbria UK veins).  Methods include room-and-pillar (Illinois flat-lying vein), cut-and-fill (small vertical veins), or sublevel stoping (in stepped areas).  Modern mines use mechanized drill-jumbos, remote-controlled 6–10 t LHDs, and digital ground support monitoring.  Ventilation focus: fluorite veins may contain U-decay radon, so active airflow and radon scrubbing are key (e.g. spit-fire CO detectors, full-face ventilation).

• **Selective mining** – Many fluorite deposits occur as discrete veins <2 m thick.  Selectivity uses small-scale equipment: roadheaders/continuous miners or even hand-held breakers to minimize dilution.  Ore sorting (X-ray transmission or optical sorting) at mine-site can discard barren gangue (silicate, limestone) early, raising head grade by ~25% ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Fluorite%2C%20CaF_,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)).  Modern mines often employ automated truck dispatch and GPS guidance for cycle efficiency. 

• **Dewatering and ground support** – Production may require pumping 50–500 L/s (Nicholson 2012 in carbonate aquifers).  Typical solutions: electric submersible pumps, drainage galleries.  Ground support uses resin bolts, steel mesh, shotcrete, especially under wet or clayey roof.  Backfill (cemented sand or waste rock paste) re-stabilizes old stopes.  Dust suppression (water sprays, rock dust) and fluoride-suppressed consumables protect workers; silicosis/XRF filters mitigate any silica hazards.

## Key Separation Technologies

• **Crushing/Grinding** – Two-stage crushing: Jaw/primary gyratory to ~150 mm, followed by cone or impact crusher to ~50 mm.  Multistage grinding: SAG/AG mills with pebble recycle, then ball mills to P₈₀ ~150–200 µm (65–100 mesh) for full liberation ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=Fluorite%2C%20CaF_,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)).  Closed-circuit hydrocyclones control grind.  Charge media are stainless or high-chrome balls to minimize iron contamination (FeO <0.3% needed for HF feedstock purity).

• **Flotation** – The main concentrate step.  At ~pH 8–9, fatty acid collectors (sodium oleate, tall oil) are used to float CaF₂ ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=of%20the%20fluorite,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=surface%20cations.%20The%20Ca,flotation%2C%20thus%20careful%20depressant%20selection)).  Rougher-scavenger stages recover ~85–95% of fluorite.  Rougher concentrates are then cleaned in multiple stages (commonly 3–7 cleaners) to meet acid-grade (≥97% CaF₂) specifications ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=of%20the%20fluorite,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)).  Column flotation cells (Jameson, Tank Cell 20) or pneumatic cells (Jameson, Imhoflot) can improve fine-particle recovery and grade.  Depressants are critical:  sodium silicate or soda ash silence fine quartz and clays, tannins or lignosulfonates depress calcite/barite, and sodium cyanide kills any sulfide interference ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=surface%20cations.%20The%20Ca,flotation%2C%20thus%20careful%20depressant%20selection)).  Pine oil or MIBC foamers at 50–100 g/t control bubble size.

• **Gravity Concentration** – Coarse pre-gravity circuits can upgrade high-grade lumps.  Dense Media Separation (DMS) or heavy-media cyclones (SG ~2.9–3.0) recover +1 mm fluorspar lumps (met-spar) with ~80–90% yield.  Jigs treat 1–10 mm heavies (fluorite + heavy sulfides) by batch pulsation.  Spirals or shaking tables polish the 0.1–1.0 mm fraction, achieving a clean concentrate (common gains: 20–30% weight recovery at high purity).  

• **Magnetic/Eddy-current** – Generally not for CaF₂ itself, but useful if ores carry magnetite or pyrrhotite.  Wet high-intensity magnetic separators can remove Fe-bearing gangue.  Barrel-type eddy-current separators may reject hydrocarbon plastics in tailings.

• **Auxiliaries** – Thickeners (high-rate or CMP) recycle process water.  Filters (pressure plates/belt filters) dewater concentrates to <10% moisture for shipping.  Tailings slurry often goes to lined storage ponds; any fluoride bleed is treated (lime or HF scrubbing) before release.  Typical reagent loads: fatty acids ~0.5–1.5 kg/t, silicates 1–2 kg/t, cyanide ~0.1 kg/t; exact flowsheet depends on ore chemistry.

*(For example procedures see Taguta et al. 2020 on fluorite flotation and SAGD (flotation recoveries, pH, collectors) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=of%20the%20fluorite,content%20of%20at%20least%2097)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/237?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=surface%20cations.%20The%20Ca,flotation%2C%20thus%20careful%20depressant%20selection)) and standard ores protocols from SME handbooks.)*

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies

• **Hydrofluoric Acid Production** – The standard path for acidspar.  CaF₂ concentrate (97%+ CaF₂) is reacted with concentrated H₂SO₄ in rotary kilns/fluid bed reactors at 250–300 °C ([www.neonickel.com](https://www.neonickel.com/technical-resources/rotary-kilns-used-in-the-manufacture-of-hydrofluoric-acid-hf-2#:~:text=2,mixing%20to%20facilitate%20the%20reaction)).  The exothermic reaction: CaF₂ + H₂SO₄ → 2 HF(g) + CaSO₄(s).  Raw kilned output “HF gas” is scrubbed with water to produce ~40–70% HF solution (technical grade).  Anhydrous (100%) HF is obtained by distillation/crystallization of hydrated HF.  Excess H₂SO₄ (5–15%) ensures conversion; off-gases CO₂ and SiO₂ require pre-drying of fluorspar to <0.2% moisture.  Captured CaSO₄ (gyp-spar) is typically landfilled or used in cement.

• **HF Purification** – Crude HF contains 2–6% H₂SiF₆ and trace metals.  Multi-phase distillation removes heavy impurities: first-stage removes involatile SiO₂, second-stage isolates aqueous HF.  Selective condensation Atex-controlled columns yield electronic-grade HF (99.99%).  HF off-gas scrubbing (with H₂O) recovers trace HF and forms 20–30% H₂SiF₆ byproduct (fluorosilicic acid).  Ion-exchange or activated carbon absorption can polish ultra-trace metal (<ppb) levels for specialty uses.

• **Aluminium Fluoride (AlF₃) Production** – Produced from HF for aluminum smelters.  Typical dry process: alumina (Al₂O₃) is fluidized with HF vapor at 450–550 °C to yield anhydrous AlF₃.  Wet route (alkaline scrub): Al(OH)₃ + 3HF(l) → AlF₃ + 3H₂O at ~90–100 °C; the slurry is then calcined (400–600 °C) to crystallize solid AlF₃.  Product specs: >90% AlF₃, <0.3% SiO₂/Fe₂O₃.

• **Synthetic Cryolite (Na₃AlF₆)** – Key for Hall–Héroult electrolysis.  From HF route: Melt AlF₃ with NaOH.  Or from H₂SiF₆ byproduct: treat fluorosilicic acid with 2Al(OH)₃ + NaOH → Na₃AlF₆ + SiO₂ + H₂O.  Mixture impurities removed by filtration and the Na₃AlF₆ is crystallized and calcined.  Final purity is 96–98% Na₃AlF₆.

• **Ultra-Pure CaF₂ (Optical Grade)** – High-end applications (IR optics, lasers) require 99.99% purity.  Routes: start with high-grade spar then leach in HCl (pH~4) to dissolve carbonates/Fe; float to remove any silica; then zone-refine or chemical vapor transport.  Crystallization (Bridgman/Czochralski) yields single crystals or large-grain polycrystals.  Tight control of contaminant elements (Mg, Fe, Si) is needed, per optical standards.

## Key Remediation Technologies

• **Water Treatment (precipitation)** –  Fluoride from mine effluent is precipitated by lime (Ca(OH)₂) addition: Ca(OH)₂ + F⁻ → CaF₂(s).  Operating pH ~10–12 achieves residual F⁻ <5–10 mg/L ([www.scielo.cl](https://www.scielo.cl/article_plus.php?lng=en&pid=S0717-97072023000205839&tlng=en#:~:text=1,NEERI%29%20and%20used%20at)).  Two-stage lime dosing (sludge recycle) can meet strict drinking-water limits (<2 mg/L).  Alum (Al₂(SO₄)₃) coagulation at pH 6–7 forms aluminum-fluoride complexes, further lowering F⁻.  The combined Nalgonda process (lime+alum) is used globally, with final F usually <1.5 ppm ([www.scielo.cl](https://www.scielo.cl/article_plus.php?lng=en&pid=S0717-97072023000205839&tlng=en#:~:text=1,NEERI%29%20and%20used%20at)).  The treatment precipitates ~3–5% of sludge by volume (CaF₂ plus Al-F solids) which is dewatered and stabilized.

• **Adsorption** – Activated alumina (AA) beds are commonly used for fluoride polishing.  AA (Al₂O₃) captures F⁻ down to <0.1 mg/L via ion exchange (capacity ~1–3 g F/kg AA).  Regeneration with NaOH recovers fluoride (as NaAlF₄) but diminishes capacity by ~10% per cycle.  Low-cost alternatives: bone char (hydroxyapatite) or modified clays (e.g. allophane) in column filters – often used in rural/low-tech settings.  New biochar composites (Mg/Al-doped) show promise as passive filter media.

• **Membranes** – Reverse osmosis (RO) is a high-triffle-fluoride removal (up to 95%) at 10–15 bar pressure ([www.scielo.cl](https://www.scielo.cl/article_plus.php?lng=en&pid=S0717-97072023000205839&tlng=en#:~:text=1,NEERI%29%20and%20used%20at)).  Nanofiltration (NF) rejects 60–90% F at lower pressure (~5–10 bar).  Electrodialysis reversal (EDR) can selectively desalinate fluoride.  Concentrate from RO/NF contains 4–6% of the influent F; it must be further treated by chemical precipitation or deep well injection.

• **Tailings and Mine Waste** – Modern practice favors dry stacking (filtered tailings) to minimize leachate.  If wet tails used, double-liner systems (HDPE + clay) are standard to stop fluoride migration.  Mine wastes/rocks can be amended with Ca or Al compounds (e.g. lime or bauxite residue) to immobilize fluoride.  Capping (clay/sand + vegetation) prevents rain infiltration.  Constructed wetlands (with calcite sand and marsh plants) have been trialed as passive fluoride polishing.

• **Air Emissions** – HF and SiF₄ from kiln stacks are controlled by wet or dry scrubbers (lime or NaOH sprays), achieving >99% removal.  Baghouses with lime injection capture particulate fluoride.  Stack concentrations are monitored continuously, with typical limits <1 mg/m³.  Worker exposures must be <2.5 mg/m³ (OSHA PEL); industrial hygiene mandates fume hoods, scrubbers, and PPE (acid baskets).

## Key Bottleneck summary

In sum, the bottleneck is downstream conversion of CaF₂ to fluorochemicals, especially HF production.  Building an HF plant is extremely capital-intensive and slow (each unit may cost 10⁸–10⁹ USD and years to permit) ([www.neonickel.com](https://www.neonickel.com/technical-resources/rotary-kilns-used-in-the-manufacture-of-hydrofluoric-acid-hf-2#:~:text=2,mixing%20to%20facilitate%20the%20reaction)).  Regulatory hurdles are high due to hydrofluoric acid’s toxicity: site approvals typically require extensive hazard reviews and citizen input, often prolonging projects by 5–10 years.  Furthermore, specialized operator training and safety measures (corrosion-resistant materials, emergency systems) are lacking in current U.S. industry.  Thus even if domestic mines succeed, without domestic HF and fluorochemical manufacturing, the fluorspar cannot be upgraded for strategic uses.  Resolving this processing gap is crucial to reduce U.S. and allied reliance on imported fluorine compounds ([www.neonickel.com](https://www.neonickel.com/technical-resources/rotary-kilns-used-in-the-manufacture-of-hydrofluoric-acid-hf-2#:~:text=2,mixing%20to%20facilitate%20the%20reaction)) ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/canada-fluorspar-new-owner-restart-on-the-cards/#:~:text=At%20present%2C%20the%20USA%E2%80%99s%20total,national%20security%20and%20the%20economy%E2%80%9D)).
