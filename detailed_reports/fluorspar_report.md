## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **USA** – Domestic output is currently negligible.  Recent USGS and industry reports show the U.S. has effectively no significant acid‐grade fluorspar production; all ~390 kt of U.S. demand in 2023 was imported ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=North%20America%20and%20Europe%20are,of%20domestic%20consumption)).  Four small projects are under development (e.g. Ares Strategic’s Lost Sheep Mine in Utah, targeting ~50 kt/yr) ([www.aresmining.com](https://www.aresmining.com/invest-in-usa-fluorspar#:~:text=HIGH%20UPSIDE%E2%80%8B)), but no large-scale mines are active today. Historical U.S. production (~3.5 Mt total from the Illinois–Kentucky belt) has long since ceased, emphasizing current import dependence ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=North%20America%20and%20Europe%20are,of%20domestic%20consumption)) ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/fluorspar-critical-us-industry-2025/#:~:text=,of%20global%20production)).  
• **Canada** – Renewed production is emerging.  Canada Fluorspar Inc. (CFI) reopened the St. Lawrence (Newfoundland) deposit in 2017 and has built ~180 kt/yr acid‐grade capacity ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/fluorspar-supply-sources-emerge-mongolia-usa-canada-greenland/#:~:text=CFI%20has%20invested%20just%20over,equity%20firm%20Golden%20Gate%20Capital)).  By late 2021 CFI began exporting fluorspar (first shipment July 2021) from a new deep-water terminal ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/fluorspar-supply-sources-emerge-mongolia-usa-canada-greenland/#:~:text=Bill%20Dobbs%2C%20President%20and%20CEO%2C,increasing%20pricing%20and%20enquiries%20as)). Production is ramping (high‐grade, low‐impurity acidspar) but remains far below capacity, so current output is on the order of tens of kilotonnes per year. Additional Canadian projects (e.g. Commerce Resources’ Ashram REE/fluorspar deposit, Quebec) are in prospecting stages.  
• **Australia** – No current production; 100% import‐reliant. Australia has no operating fluorspar mines today ([fluorspar.com](https://fluorspar.com/2025/04/29/australias-first-domestic-fluorite-project-set-for-2025/#:~:text=supply%20chains)).  The first planned domestic project is Tivan’s Speewah (WA) aiming for ~140 kt/yr of acidspar by 2027 ([www.projectblue.com](https://www.projectblue.com/blue/news-analysis/970/tivan-accelerates-speewah-after-fluorine-inclusion-on-australia-critical-minerals-list#:~:text=expansion%2C%20supported%20by%20drilling%20plans,including%20the%20Critical%20Minerals%20Production)).  Until then ANZ consumption (industrial chemicals, aluminium, steel fluxes) is met entirely by imports (largely from Vietnam/S. Africa).  
• **EU (allies)** – Current output is limited and concentrated in Spain.  Spanish groups (e.g. Grupo Minersa) produced ~187 kt in 2021 (falling to ~153 kt in 2022) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1338722/fluorspar-production-volume-spain/#:~:text=Fluorspar%20production%20in%20Spain%20saw,CaF%E2%82%82)).  Smaller operations exist (e.g. older mines in Italy/Ireland, but Western Europe’s fluorite output beyond Spain is negligible).  Overall, EU domestic production meets only ~33% of its needs ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2CEurope%E2%80%99s%20domestic%20production,demand%20for%20this%20critical%20mineral)) (rest imported mainly as acidspar from Mexico/South Africa).  No other allied EU country (Norway, Iceland) has any production. Japan similarly produces effectively zero fluorspar.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **USA** – U.S. consumption (~390 kt in 2023 ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=North%20America%20and%20Europe%20are,of%20domestic%20consumption))) is expected to grow with demand for HF and fluorochemicals (EV batteries, semiconductors, refrigerants).  Industry forecasts (5%+ CAGR in Western humid markets ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miners-seeing-production-shift-for-the-fluorspar-billion-dollar-market-301197268.html#:~:text=the%3A%20,the%20market%20for%20fluorspar%20in))) imply US demand may reach roughly **~0.5–0.6** Mt/yr by 2030.  Texas Instruments, auto and defense industries, and new battery plants drive a multidecade ramp.  
• **Europe** – EU demand is also rising. With domestic output only ~150 kt/yr (2022) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1338722/fluorspar-production-volume-spain/#:~:text=Fluorspar%20production%20in%20Spain%20saw,CaF%E2%82%82)) covering ~1/3 of use ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2CEurope%E2%80%99s%20domestic%20production,demand%20for%20this%20critical%20mineral)), Europe likely needs **~0.5–0.7** Mt/yr by 2030. Growth in batteries, semiconductors and nuclear (HF use) suggests ~4–5% annual increase ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=Global%20fluorspar%20production%20in%202023,over%20the%20next%205%20years)), pushing demand closer to **600–700 kt/yr** in the EU by 2030.  
• **Canada** – Current consumption is on order of tens of kt/yr (mostly metallurgical/ceramic spar for alumina, steel). With CFI’s ramp-up, Canada’s ~180 kt capacity could meet domestic needs; thus forecast demand may be ~**0.1–0.15** Mt/yr by 2030 (higher grade uses). Domestic demand remains smaller than US/EU but likely to climb modestly (auto and glass sectors).  
• **Australia** – From zero domestic, demand is currently ~50–100 kt/yr (all imported). With Speewah’s 0.14 Mt capacity coming online by 2027 ([www.projectblue.com](https://www.projectblue.com/blue/news-analysis/970/tivan-accelerates-speewah-after-fluorine-inclusion-on-australia-critical-minerals-list#:~:text=expansion%2C%20supported%20by%20drilling%20plans,including%20the%20Critical%20Minerals%20Production)), Australia’s demand (~HF, aluminium, steel) could reach **~0.15–0.2** Mt/yr by 2030 (partly satisfied by local output).  
• **Japan** – Largely unchanged: imports close to 100% at present. High‐tech, HF-using industries (semis, specialty chemicals) maintain stable demand on the order of **50–100 kt/yr** by 2030, unless major industry shifts.  
• **Summary (Allies)** – Combined US+Canada+EU+Australia+Japan demand could thus approach ~**1.5–2.0 Mt/yr** by 2030, depending on growth rates (up from ~1.0–1.2 Mt in 2023).  Absent new substitutes, ongoing expansion of EVs and fluorochemicals (IEA predicts 12× EV battery growth by 2035 ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=The%20IEA%20estimates%20EV%20battery,a%20secure%20supply%20of%20fluorspar))) is likely to keep demand rising at mid-single-digit CAGR.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **USA** – Potentially **50–150 kt/yr** domestic supply by 2030, if development projects succeed.  Ares’s Lost Sheep (UT) targets ~50 kt/yr (metalspar & acidspar) ([www.aresmining.com](https://www.aresmining.com/invest-in-usa-fluorspar#:~:text=HIGH%20UPSIDE%E2%80%8B)).  Other junior projects (Kentucky, Illinois, Utah mines) could add tens of kt more. However, until US alkaline plants (HF production) are built, even mined CaF₂ may be shipped out.  
• **Canada** – ~**0.18 Mt/yr** acidspar supply is achievable by 2030.  CFI’s St. Lawrence mine (NL) has ~180 kt capacity ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/fluorspar-supply-sources-emerge-mongolia-usa-canada-greenland/#:~:text=CFI%20has%20invested%20just%20over,equity%20firm%20Golden%20Gate%20Capital)) (almost all treated to acidspar). If fully ramped, Canada could export modest surpluses. Additional projects (Commerce Ashram) might add another few tens of kt if brought online.  
• **Australia** – Up to **0.14 Mt/yr** acidspar by 2030.  Speewah (WA) is slated for 140 kt/year (acidspar) from 2027 ([www.projectblue.com](https://www.projectblue.com/blue/news-analysis/970/tivan-accelerates-speewah-after-fluorine-inclusion-on-australia-critical-minerals-list#:~:text=expansion%2C%20supported%20by%20drilling%20plans,including%20the%20Critical%20Minerals%20Production)); no other projects are likely before 2030. All of Speewah’s output (97–99% CaF₂) will count as domestic supply once operational.  
• **EU** – ~**0.15–0.25 Mt/yr**.  Spain’s mines (~150 kt in 2022 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1338722/fluorspar-production-volume-spain/#:~:text=Fluorspar%20production%20in%20Spain%20saw,CaF%E2%82%82))) are largely stable.  By 2030 new European mines may add: Germany’s Käfersteige (FRG) at 100 kt/yr (from ~2030) ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=the%20opening%20of%20the%20K%C3%A4fersteige,of%20the%20EU%E2%80%99s%20demand)), and Italy’s planned Silius (Sardinia, investment ~$47M) expected up to tens of kt.  Together, EU domestic supply could reach **~250 kt/yr** by 2030 if new projects materialize, still only a fraction of EU demand ([theoregongroup.com](https://theoregongroup.com/investment-insights/where-will-fluorspar-for-us-made-evs-come-from/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2CEurope%E2%80%99s%20domestic%20production,demand%20for%20this%20critical%20mineral)).  
• **Others** – Norway/Iceland: negligible. Japan: virtually 0 (no native mines).  Allied supply is dominated by projects above.  Total allied production by 2030 might be on the order of **0.5–0.6 Mt/yr**, far short of combined demand, implying continued heavy imports unless many projects accelerate.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry**: Identifying fluorite-host rocks (carbonatites, marbles, hydrothermal veins, skarn/vein systems) via detailed bedrock mapping. Systematic soil/stream sediment geochemical surveys (ICP or XRF) target anomalies in Ca, F, Ba, Y and associated elements (e.g. Zn, Pb) as pathfinders ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/8/838#:~:text=However%2C%20research%20on%20ore%20deposit,seated)). Airborne hyperspectral imagery (ASTER, Sentinel-2) can detect surface alteration minerals (e.g. barite, silica, carbonate) related to fluoriteization.  
• **Radiometric Surveys**: Less common, but airborne ground gamma methods can flag Th/U anomalies if fluorite is in carbonatites (some carbonatites carry thorium). Ground-based portable gamma spectrometers were used in China to help pinpoint concealed ore zones ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/8/838#:~:text=However%2C%20being%20located%20in%20the,mineralization%20anomalies%2C%20while%20AMT%20surveys)).  
• **Airborne/Drone Geophysics**: In covered terrain, high-resolution gravity and magnetics may highlight buried structures (as at Okorusu, Namibia) though fluorite’s low density contrast makes this indirect. Recent research (Liu et al. 2024) shows integrated geophysics (ground magnetics + induced polarization) can delineate hidden fluorite veins ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/8/838#:~:text=However%2C%20being%20located%20in%20the,mineralization%20anomalies%2C%20while%20AMT%20surveys)). Audio-frequency magnetotellurics (deep resistivity) have also been applied to outline deep feeder structures ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/8/838#:~:text=However%2C%20being%20located%20in%20the,mineralization%20anomalies%2C%20while%20AMT%20surveys)).  
• **Ground Geophysics**: Induced polarization (IP) surveys can reveal disseminated sulfide/dolomite halos around fluorite veins, as demonstrated in the Gobi desert ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/8/838#:~:text=However%2C%20being%20located%20in%20the,mineralization%20anomalies%2C%20while%20AMT%20surveys)).  On smaller scale, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) or electromagnetic surveys may help locate shallow pits or vein zones in non-conductive rock.  
• **Remote Sensing & AI**: Satellite LiDAR and hyperspectral analysis (with ML algorithms) can trace outcrops and alteration zones. Machine learning on geologic databases (e.g. mineral occurrence records, geochemistry) can prioritize targets (though still emerging). Robotics (drones, automated outcrop scanners) can increase sampling speed in remote areas.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-pit mining**: Used for near-surface deposits.  E.g. Okorusu (Namibia) was mined by conventional open pits (1955–2014), extracting ~45 kt/yr of fluorspar ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323185491_Mine_design_of_an_underground_fluorspar_mine_in_Okorusu_Namibia#:~:text=The%20global%20annual%20production%20of,fluorspar%20is)). Mobile equipment (drills, excavators, haul trucks) cuts benches through carbonatite/skarn orebodies. High horsepower excavators break the typically hard fluorite-bearing rock.  
• **Underground mining**: For deeper narrow veins.  Standard methods include drift & bench (sublevel breast) stoping or cut-and-fill in steep veins.  Okorusu’s planned 100 kt/yr output was based on developing underground stopes ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323185491_Mine_design_of_an_underground_fluorspar_mine_in_Okorusu_Namibia#:~:text=important%20fluorspar%20producer%20%28U,of%20access%20to%20the%20underground)).  Typical extraction uses drilling & blasting (preferably guided drills for narrow veins), then mechanical loading (LHDs) of broken ore.  Smaller veins (<3–5 m thick) are selectively mined to minimize dilution.  
• **Selective mechanization**: Modern mines use automated drill jumbos and remote-controlled LHD loaders to improve safety.  Specialized narrow-vein loaders (boomer rigs) may be employed. Ventilation systems are critical (fluorspar dust can be toxic). Advanced cut control (even remotely steered drills or jackleg drills) maximizes recovery of high-CaF₂ ore threads.  
• **Backfilling & Support**: Many fluorite workings use cemented fill or rockfill behind stopes since ore veins are often tabular and discontinuous. Rock bolts and shotcrete secure walls for worker safety. Where veins cross host rock, careful ground control (ribs/bolts) prevents collapse.  
• **Ancillary**: Crushing & feeders (in-mine jaw crushers) feed ore to surface milling. Conveyors or rail haulage may be used (e.g. ARES Lost Sheep has a Union Pacific rail spur) ([www.aresmining.com](https://www.aresmining.com/invest-in-usa-fluorspar#:~:text=HIGH%20UPSIDE%E2%80%8B)). Water management is also key: pumps for dewatering and systems to neutralize any acidic seepage.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Crushing & Grinding**: Fluorite ore is typically crushed to ~–50 mm and ground to 48–65 mesh to liberate CaF₂ crystals ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=Grinding%20Circuit)).  Standard SAG/ball milling circuits (closed-circuit classifiers) are used.  Grinding media/materials are chosen to avoid silica contamination.  
• **Flotation (Bulk & Selective)**: Froth flotation is the principal concentration method.  “Sub-A” cell flotation machines (cell-to-cell design) are industry standard ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=Over%2095,most%20economical%20and%20efficient%20retreatment)).  In rougher flotation, up to ~80% of ore mass (bulk float) is recovered; multiple cleaning stages are then applied for high-purity acid grade ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=Over%2095,most%20economical%20and%20efficient%20retreatment)) ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=Flotation%20of%20fluorspar%20must%20be,with%20a%20minimum%20circulating%20load)).  Reagent schemes typically use fatty acid collectors (e.g. oleate) and frothers. Pay minerals (sulphides like galena, sphalerite) are floated first (often by differential flotation or jigs) and removed ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=The%20Selective%20Mineral%20Jig%20may,coarse%20size%2C%20in%20the%20jig)). Tailings are thickened and recirculated to maximize recovery.  
• **Gravity Concentration**: Employed only if significant heavy sulphides are present.  Selective jigs or spiral concentrators may pre-treat ore to extract galena/zinc ores, lightening the load on fluorspar circuits ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=The%20Selective%20Mineral%20Jig%20may,coarse%20size%2C%20in%20the%20jig)). Otherwise, gravity is minor (fluorite’s density is only ~3.18).  
• **Chemical Pretreatment**:  Oxidized sulfates on surfaces of CaF₂ crystals can be removed by “sulphidization” (e.g. Na₂S or NaSH) to activate the fluorite surface before flotation ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=it%20at%20a%20relatively%20coarse,size%2C%20in%20the%20jig)). pH controllers (lime or soda ash) and modifiers (e.g. sodium silicate, cyanide) are used to suppress unwanted minerals.  
• **Intensive Cleaning**: Acid-grade (≥97% CaF₂) requires strict cut – multi-stage float cells with wash water sprays to rinse gangue.  Cleaner tails are recycled back to regrind to capture lost fluorspar ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=Over%2095,most%20economical%20and%20efficient%20retreatment)) ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/fluorspar-beneficiation-process-flotation-plant#:~:text=Flotation%20of%20fluorspar%20must%20be,with%20a%20minimum%20circulating%20load)). Thickening/filtering systems handle concentrates; dewatering is usually via pressure filters to <0.5% moisture for shipment.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Hydrofluoric Acid (HF) Production**: Boiled-down CaF₂ (acid-grade concentrate) is fed to sulfuric acid decomposition reactors.  CaF₂ + H₂SO₄ → CaSO₄ (solids) + 2 HF (gas).  Modern HF plants use high-temperature fluid beds or rotary kilns to maximize HF yield. The raw HF vapor is scrubbed and distilled to remove impurities (e.g. SiF₄ forms H₂SiF₆ in condensate).  Deep purification (multi-stage distillation or fluorine gas scrubbing) is required to achieve electronics-grade HF ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4056605A/en#:~:text=US4056605A%20,more%20or%20less%20deeply%20purified)). Impurities (H₂SiF₆, H₂SO₄) in crude HF can range 2–6% by weight ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US4056605A/en#:~:text=US4056605A%20,more%20or%20less%20deeply%20purified)) and must be removed for many end-uses.  
• **Cryolite and AlF₃ Production**: Some HF is reacted with Al₂O₃ (alumina) to synthesize AlF₃ or cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) for aluminum smelting.  This is typically done in dedicated melts or electrochemical cells.  By-product CaO is recycled or disposed as gypsum (Fluorspar→HF→AlF₃ chain).  
• **Concentration Refinement**: For ultra-high purity uses (optical CaF₂ crystals, spectrochemicals), further chemical refining is used.  Examples include: solvent recrystallization, acid leaching (e.g. dilute HCl soak to remove residual carbonates/Fe) and high-temperature fluorination steps.  Achieving >99.99% purity CaF₂ may involve multiple purification passes.  
• **Electrochemical Fluroine Gas**: Electrolysis of anhydrous HF (or KF-HF melt) produces F₂ gas (e.g. Simons process). While not directly needed for fluorspar per se, it is critical downstream.  Industrial cells (e.g. Teflon-lined) separate F₂ (used to fluorinate organics or produce UF₆) from H₂ by-product.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Water Defluoridation**: Treatment of process/tail water to remove excess F⁻.  Common methods include precipitation (adding Ca(OH)₂ or Al₂(SO₄)₃ to form insoluble CaF₂/H₂SiF₆ flocs) ([www.emergency-wash.org](https://www.emergency-wash.org/water/en/technologies/technology/fluoride-removal-technologies#:~:text=the%20Nalgonda%20technique%2C%20uses%20added,must%20be%20properly%20disposed%20of)).  The “Nalgonda” process (lime + alum dosing) is widely used, yielding <2 mg/L F in effluent ([www.emergency-wash.org](https://www.emergency-wash.org/water/en/technologies/technology/fluoride-removal-technologies#:~:text=coagulation%2Fprecipitation%20or%20adsorption%2Fion%20exchange%20processes,daily%20supply%20of%20chemicals%20is)).  Coagulant aids and settling tanks remove the fluoride sludge.  
• **Adsorption/Filtration**: Passing wastewater through layers of activated alumina or bone char/hydroxyapatite filters selectively adsorbs fluoride ([www.emergency-wash.org](https://www.emergency-wash.org/water/en/technologies/technology/fluoride-removal-technologies#:~:text=Adsorption%2Fion%20exchange%20passes%20the%20water,decreases%20with%20each%20regeneration%20cycle)).  These media (Al₂O₃, synthetic HAP) can capture >90% of F⁻, and can be regenerated with mild HCl/NaOH soak ([www.emergency-wash.org](https://www.emergency-wash.org/water/en/technologies/technology/fluoride-removal-technologies#:~:text=Adsorption%2Fion%20exchange%20passes%20the%20water,decreases%20with%20each%20regeneration%20cycle)).  This is well-proven for drinking-water defluoridation and can be scaled for effluent streams.  
• **pH Control & Neutralization**: Any acidic streams (e.g. from HF scrubbers) are neutralized with lime/alkali to precipitate fluorides and adjust pH before discharge. This also helps remove heavy metals (Pb, Zn) as hydroxides.  
• **Arsenic/Sulfide Removal**: If ores contain metalliferous impurities, precipitation (e.g. ferric/caustic co-precipitation) or sulfide precipitation systems (adding Na₂S to dump metals into sediment) are applied before fluoride treatment, preventing As/Zn from sacrificing adsorption capacity.  
• **Dust Control & Tailings Management**: Drying systems and enclosed conveyors prevent airborne fluorspar dust (to avoid respirable F compounds). Tailings dams incorporate liners or cemented disposal to immobilize fluorides. Phytostabilization (e.g. growing grass cover) can be used on tailings to limit runoff. Waste CaSO₄ (from HF plants) can be sold or safely landfilled (it is essentially gypsum).

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Acid‐grade processing infrastructure**:  The biggest technical bottleneck is the lack of domestic HF/fluorine processing plants.  Even if new mines produce CaF₂ concentrate, without local fluorspar furnaces and hydrofluoric acid plants, raw ore cannot be fully utilized.  For example, the U.S. has been “100% import[ing]” acidspar-grade fluorspar ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miners-seeing-production-shift-for-the-fluorspar-billion-dollar-market-301197268.html#:~:text=applications,countries%20outside%20the%20United%20States)), and relies on phosphate‐acid byproduct (fluorosilicic acid) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/fluorspar-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Fluorspar%20is%20used%20directly%20or,fluorspar%20production%20or%20consumption%20calculations)).  Building new HF furnaces and acid handling (requiring high-T reactors, precipitators, scrubbers) will be a slow, capital‐intensive step. 

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The chief technological bottleneck is **downstream processing** rather than mining per se.  In practice, domestic fluorspar producers must also assemble industrial acid-production capacity (HF acid plants and aluminum fluoride melt facilities) to convert CaF₂ into usable products.  Without these high-temperature chemical processing plants (and skilled operators), newly mined fluorspar cannot be fully integrated into U.S./allied supply chains ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miners-seeing-production-shift-for-the-fluorspar-billion-dollar-market-301197268.html#:~:text=applications,countries%20outside%20the%20United%20States)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/centers/national-minerals-information-center/fluorspar-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Fluorspar%20is%20used%20directly%20or,fluorspar%20production%20or%20consumption%20calculations)). This gap—built in decades ago—remains the key limiting factor for re-establishing a self-sufficient fluorspar industry.
