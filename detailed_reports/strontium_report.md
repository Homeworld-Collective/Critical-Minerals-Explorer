## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
The United States has *no active strontium mining* and essentially 0 production ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Mexico%20is%20the%20leading%20producer,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)).  The only significant allied mineral source is Spain’s Montevive (Aurora) deposit, which produces **>100,000 t/yr** of celestine ore (≈80% SrSO₄) by open-pit mining ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=The%20mine%20produces%20over%20100%2C000,crushing)).  Fertiberia’s Química del Estroncio plant (Cartagena, Spain) converts this ore to SrCO₃/Sr(NO₃)₂.  Other EU countries (Germany, France, Italy, etc.) and Japan have no domestic ores and rely on imported celestine or salts.  Canada, Australia, Norway and Iceland currently have *negligible or no* strontium mining.  In practical terms, US/allied production of elemental strontium or its compounds is essentially confined to processing imported or Spanish raw material.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Strontium demand is rising globally (used in ferrite magnets, pyrotechnics, optics, etc.).  Global strontium consumption was ≈328,000 t in 2022 and is forecast to reach ≈578,000 t by 2030 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=In%20the%20changed%20post%20COVID,year%20period)).  The US market alone was about 89.4 kt in 2022 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=The%20U,and%205.9)).  Assuming similar growth rates (~5–7% CAGR) for allied countries, US+allied demand could be on the order of **2–3×10^5 t/yr** by 2030.  For example, Japan and Canada are both forecast at ~4–6% annual growth ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=geographic%20markets%20are%20Japan%20and,Total%2019%20Featured)), and German (EU) demand ~5% ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/fr/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=geographic%20markets%20are%20Japan%20and,Total%2019%20Featured)).  Key end-uses (pyrotechnics, Sr-ferrites for motors, specialty glass/ceramics, medical radiology) will drive demand to perhaps **≈200–250 kt/yr** across US & ally markets by 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Domestic supply in 2030 will still be dominated by allied imports and Spain’s output.  Spain’s mine provides ~100 kt/yr of celestine ore (~20–40 kt Sr content) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=The%20mine%20produces%20over%20100%2C000,crushing)).  No new U.S., Canadian or Australian mines are expected by 2030, so US domestic strontium *mined* output remains 0.  Allied recycling is essentially nonexistent: the EU’s end-of-life Sr recycling input rate (EOLRIR) is negligible ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20review%20addresses%20the,and%20smart%20materials%20present%20new)).  Thus US/allies will continue to rely almost entirely on foreign raw material or processed imports; domestic (Spanish) ore will supply only a fraction of overall demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geologic Mapping & Geochemistry**: Identify Meso-Cenozoic evaporite/carbonate basins known to host celestine.  For example, major deposits occur in *coastal marine carbonate–evaporite* sequences ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283440131_Stratigraphy_geochemistry_and_depositional_environment_of_the_celestine-bearing_gypsiferous_formations_of_the_Tertiary_Ulas-Sivas_Basin_East-Central_Anatolia_Turkey#:~:text=,)) (e.g. Zagros, Anatolia).  Geologic mapping of such strata, combined with soil/rock geochemical surveys for *Sr (and Ba)* anomalies (often tied to gypsum/anhydrite phases), guides exploration.  
• **Geophysical Surveys**: Gravity and magnetic surveys can highlight buried dense sulfate layers or breccias.  Celestine (density ≈3.9 g/cm³) can produce gravity highs; electromagnetic or resistivity methods may detect brine-soaked evaporitic horizons.  Airborne gravity/magnetic and ground EM could delineate targets under cover.  
• **Radiometric & Hyperspectral**: Although celestine is non-radioactive, radiometric surveys (U/Th) can sometimes signal associated REE/carbonatite systems. Hyperspectral or multispectral imaging may detect surface gypsum/anhydrite. Remote sensing to identify geochemical alteration (e.g. Al/Ca ratios) can highlight karst zones where celestine precipitates.  
• **Geochemical Tracing**: Stream-sediment and soil sampling downstream of known mineralized areas to trace strontium-leached anomalies. Leachate sampling from old tailings can also indicate hidden mineralization.  
• **Drilling/Trenching**: Once targets are identified, conventional RC or core drilling (or trenching in outcrop) through carbonate bodies can directly confirm strontium minerals (celestine or strontianite). 

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Mining**: Bulk removal of celestine ore by conventional means.  At Montevive (Spain), an open-cast operation (~332 ha) drills, blasts and hauls the SrSO₄-bearing rock ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=for%20the%20European%20Union%20,Ha%20or%2011%20mining%20grids)).  Heavy excavators, haul trucks, and conveyors handle the cut ore.  
• **Dredging/Placer Mining**: In theory, near-shore or alluvial deposits (e.g. eroded evaporite basins) could be dredged.  This is not currently practiced for Sr on any scale, but is a potential technology if alluvial celestine were identified.  
• **Byproduct Recovery**: Sr can be recovered from processing of other minerals.  For example, the “strontian process” in zinc refining precipitates Sr from flue dust.  Similarly, barite (BaSO₄) operations may co-recover Sr.  These flowsheet integrations (flotation of Zn precipitates, acid leach of dust) can extract Sr without a standalone mine.  
• **Solution Mining (R&D)**: Laboratory work on microbial or weak-acid leaching of low-grade celestine exists, but no commercial in-situ leaching is practiced.  In principle, injecting carbonate or acetate solutions to dissolve Sr and pump it out could be attempted in the future.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Dense Media Separation (DMS)**: Sink–float cyclones or jigs using heavy suspensions (ferrosilicon, magnetite) exploit celestine’s high density.  DMS can concentrate ~75–85% celestine ore with very high Sr recovery (~94% reported) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=behaviour%2C%20the%20following%20parameters%20were,concentrated%20using%20DMS%20hydrocyclones%20and)).  This is proven for Montevive tailings (recovering low-grade dumps) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=20%C2%B0,and%20environmentally%20damaging%20clearing%2C%20by)).  
• **Gravity Concentration**: Conventional gravity methods (jigs, spirals, shaking tables) sort coarse particles by density.  They remove gangue (calcium/carbonate minerals) and upgrade the SrSO₄ concentrate before flotation.  
• **Flotation**: After grinding to fine powder, cerium minerals like celestine or strontianite are floated using selective collectors.  Examples include fatty acid or amine collectors at alkaline pH to float carbonate/sulfate phases.  Combined with DMS, flotation markedly improves Sr purity ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=)).  
• **Screening/Classification**: Size separation (vibrating screens) removes fines and coarse waste, improving downstream recovery.  Proper classification ensures optimal performance of cyclones and table/spiral circuits ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=)).  
• **Other**: Magnetic or electrostatic sorting are generally ineffective (celestine is non-magnetic/non-conductive).  Ore sorting machines (X-ray or optical) could, in theory, pick out shapely celestine crystals if distinctive, but this is not yet standard.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Carbonation (“Natron”) Roasting**: The classic route is roasting celestine with sodium carbonate.  CaCO₃•SrCO₃** (black ash)**: SrSO₄ + 2 Na₂CO₃ → SrCO₃ + Na₂SO₄ + CO₂.  At ~1100–1200 °C this yields SrCO₃ and soluble Na₂SO₄.  The sulfate is leached out, leaving high-grade SrCO₃ ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272540670_Preparation_of_strontium_carbonate_from_celestite#:~:text=Preparation%20of%20strontium%20carbonate%20from,reduced%20with%20coke%20at%20temperatures)).  
• **Reduction (“Black Ash”) Process**: An alternative is carbothermic reduction: SrSO₄ + C → SrS + CO₂ (at >1000 °C), then SrS + H₂O + CO₂ → SrCO₃ + H₂S (or double decomposition).  This coke-based method is used industrially but requires strong reductants ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272540670_Preparation_of_strontium_carbonate_from_celestite#:~:text=Preparation%20of%20strontium%20carbonate%20from,reduced%20with%20coke%20at%20temperatures)).  
• **Acid Leach & Crystallization**: SrCO₃ (or ore) can be dissolved in mineral acids (HCl, H₂SO₄, HNO₃) to make Sr salts.  For example, SrCO₃ + 2HNO₃ → Sr(NO₃)₂ + CO₂ + H₂O.  Controlled crystallization or ion-exchange is then used to isolate Sr(NO₃)₂, SrCl₂ or SrSO₄ (anhydrite) with high purity.  *Sakai Chemical (Japan)* and others use refined Sr salts for imaging and lasers, requiring very low impurity levels.  
• **Calcination**: Final SrCO₃ product may be calcined (up to ~1500 °C) to remove volatiles or convert to SrO for ceramic applications.  High-temperature kilns or shaft furnaces are used for these purification steps ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331040466_Calcination_of_Strontium_Carbonate_in_Rotary_Kiln_Furnace#:~:text=Cuneyt%20Arslan)).  
• **Fractional Precipitation**: To remove trace Ba/Ca, stepwise pH adjustment can co-precipitate Sr with those cations (or remove them).  Re-dissolution and recrystallization cycles yield ultra-pure Sr salts when needed (e.g. for standards or optics).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Mineral Pre-Concentration**: Advanced beneficiation reduces waste.  For example, applying DMS before milling recovers valuable Sr from low-grade dumps or seams, thus avoiding large tailings dumps ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=year.%20High,concentration%20methods%20to%20eliminate)).  Ariza-Rodríguez *et al.* note that pre-concentration of Montevive tailings (75–85% SrSO₄) can recover otherwise lost ore and “avoid new blasting and clearing” ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=medium,clearing%2C%20which%20are%20environmentally%20damaging)), minimizing the environmental footprint.  
• **Wastewater Treatment**: Strontium-laden effluent is treated by precipitation – typically by adding lime or carbonate to co-precipitate Sr as SrCO₃ or allow it to substitute into CaCO₃.  Ion-exchange resins or zeolites (e.g. clinoptilolite) can selectively remove Sr from dilute streams if required.  Strict pH control ensures Radionuclide-limit levels (for radioactive Sr isotopes).  
• **Tailings Management**: Physically isolating waste (lined impoundments) prevents Sr leaching.  Gypsum or anhydrite (common gangue minerals) can also act as barriers by adsorbing Sr.  Slurries are recycled or neutralized to avoid acidic, Sr-rich drainage.  
• **Phytoremediation (Research)**: Some plants (e.g., Sorghum) can uptake Sr as they do Ca ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-017-8432-8#:~:text=Phytoremediation%20of%20strontium%20contaminated%20soil,Cd%20accumulation%20characteristics%20of%20Salvia)).  Constructed wetlands or specially-planted crops have been proposed to clean Sr-contaminated waters.  This is still experimental, but may offer low-tech cleanup for small leaks.  
• **Circular Strategies**: With negligible recycling today ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20the%20review%20addresses%20the,and%20smart%20materials%20present%20new)), emphasis is on closed-loop design.  Future remediation could include recovering Sr from industrial wastes (e.g. glass cullet or CRT phosphors) to cut primary demand.  Regulatory controls (monitoring Sr isotopes, limiting effluent) will also be essential.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The chief bottleneck is the *lack of domestic ores and processing sites*.  No U.S./Canadian/Australian Sr mines exist, so allied supply hinges on one Spanish source and imports ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Mexico%20is%20the%20leading%20producer,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=The%20mine%20produces%20over%20100%2C000,crushing)).  Even if ore were found, exploiting low-grade celestine requires advanced beneficiation (e.g. dense-medium cyclones to upgrade 70–80% ore) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=year.%20High,concentration%20methods%20to%20eliminate)).  Moreover, refining SrSO₄ to SrCO₃/Sr-salts demands specialized, energy-intensive plants (soda-ash roasting or coke reduction) that are not present on U.S./allied soil ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272540670_Preparation_of_strontium_carbonate_from_celestite#:~:text=Preparation%20of%20strontium%20carbonate%20from,reduced%20with%20coke%20at%20temperatures)).  In essence, the technology gap in both **extraction (ore processing) and conversion (chemical refining)** is the limiting factor.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In summary, the lack of domestic celestine reserves and associated processing infrastructure is the critical bottleneck.  Advanced ore-preconcentration (dense-media separation) and high-temperature conversion (Na₂CO₃ roast or carbothermic reduction) are needed to produce Sr compounds efficiently ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/14/3/306#:~:text=year.%20High,concentration%20methods%20to%20eliminate)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272540670_Preparation_of_strontium_carbonate_from_celestite#:~:text=Preparation%20of%20strontium%20carbonate%20from,reduced%20with%20coke%20at%20temperatures)).  Since these technologies and ores are lacking in the US and most allies, supply will remain import-dependent unless new deposits or domestic plants emerge.
