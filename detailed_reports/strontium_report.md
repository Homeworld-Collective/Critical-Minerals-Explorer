## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Lack of domestic ore deposits; absence of chemical conversion facilities; need for dense-media separation and high-temperature processing*  

The primary bottleneck is the near-total absence of domestic celestine (SrSO₄) ore in the United States and allied countries, coupled with a lack of specialized processing plants.  USGS data note that there has been **“no celestite production in the United States since 1959”** ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Republic%20of%20Korea,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)).  Outside Spain, no allied nation has a significant strontium ore mine ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Celestine%20%28SrSO_,producer%20in%20the%20European%20Union)).  Spain’s Montevive (Aurora) deposit in Granada is Europe’s largest celestine mine, and Fertiberia’s Química del Estroncio (Cartagena) facility is the only EU plant converting raw ore to intermediates ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Celestine%20%28SrSO_,producer%20in%20the%20European%20Union)) ([www.fertiberia.com](https://www.fertiberia.com/en/quimica-del-estroncio/#:~:text=The%20start,produce%20this%20strontium%20nitrate%20salt)).  Any new domestic output would require advanced ore upgrading and high-temperature conversion: in practice this means deploying dense-media separation or other gravity concentration to lift low-grade feeds (often ≈60–85% SrSO₄) to high-purity concentrate ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Beneficiation%20techniques%20such%20as%20size,improved%20celestine%20recovery%20and%20purity)), and constructing costly thermal roast or reduction plants to make usable strontium compounds.  For example, the conventional soda-ash roast (SrSO₄ + Na₂CO₃ → SrCO₃ + Na₂SO₄ at ≈1100–1200 °C) or the “black ash” carbothermic process (SrSO₄ + C → SrS + 2 CO at ∼1000 °C, followed by leaching SrS + Na₂CO₃ → SrCO₃ + Na₂S) are well-established industrial routes ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=Strontium%20sulfate%20%2C%20%5BCAS%207759,Pg.1554)) ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=where%20soda%20ash%20is%20added,23)).  These specialized, high-temperature units do not exist in the US or most allied territories.  In short, without native celestite deposits and without facilities (dense-media separators, kilns, roasters, etc.) to process them, the US and its allies remain entirely import-dependent for strontium ore and compounds ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Republic%20of%20Korea,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)) ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=where%20soda%20ash%20is%20added,23)).    

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: 0 tons US production; ~38,000 tons Sr content from Spain*  

The United States has **zero** strontium ore production – no active celestine mines – so all primary material is imported ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Republic%20of%20Korea,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)).  Spain’s Montevive‐Aurora open-pit (Granada Basin) is the only significant allied source.  A typical year’s output from Montevive is on the order of **50,000 tonnes of celestine ore** (average ≈60% SrSO₄) ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/economia/china-desembarca-granada-relanzar-supermina-tubos-television.html#:~:text=En%20cifras%2C%20en%20un%20a%C3%B1o,nuevas%20t%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20miner%C3%ADa%20sostenible)).  After beneficiation to high grade (80–85% SrSO₄), this yields roughly **30,000–40,000 t/year of pure strontium** (87.6% of SrSO₄ by mass) – equivalent to past estimates of ~38,000 t Sr content from Spain ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/economia/china-desembarca-granada-relanzar-supermina-tubos-television.html#:~:text=En%20cifras%2C%20en%20un%20a%C3%B1o,nuevas%20t%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20miner%C3%ADa%20sostenible)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/10/1261?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=The%20Montevive%20celestine%20deposit%20is,mineralogy%20of%20the%20celestine%20ore)).  Spain’s Química del Estroncio (Fertiberia) then converts this ore into strontium carbonate and nitrate ([www.fertiberia.com](https://www.fertiberia.com/en/quimica-del-estroncio/#:~:text=The%20start,produce%20this%20strontium%20nitrate%20salt)).  By contrast, **no other EU country or Japan** produces celestine: they rely on imports of raw ore or finished salts ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Celestine%20%28SrSO_,producer%20in%20the%20European%20Union)).  Likewise, Canada, Australia, Norway, and Iceland have no modern celestine mines (only tiny historical occurrences) ([www.energymining.sa.gov.au](https://www.energymining.sa.gov.au/industry/minerals-and-mining/mineral-commodities/celestite#:~:text=Celestite%20is%20widely%20distributed%20in,crystals%20in%20modern%20drainage%20channels)) ([www.energymining.sa.gov.au](https://www.energymining.sa.gov.au/industry/minerals-and-mining/mineral-commodities/celestite#:~:text=A%20total%20of%20113%20t,and%20106%20t%20in%201941%E2%80%9342)).  In practical terms, US and allied output of strontium materials today is limited to Spain’s processing of its own ore and of whatever ore Europe or others import; there is no domestic “mined” tonnage in the US or other allies ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Republic%20of%20Korea,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)) ([www.fertiberia.com](https://www.fertiberia.com/en/quimica-del-estroncio/#:~:text=The%20start,produce%20this%20strontium%20nitrate%20salt)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 200,000–250,000 tons projected combined demand*  

Strontium demand is expanding due to its use in ferrite magnets, specialty glasses (X-ray/optical), pyrotechnics, and emerging high-tech applications ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20European%20Union,ceramic%20magnets%20and%20drilling%20fluids)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=Global%20Strontium%20Market%20to%20Reach,year%20period)).  Market analysts estimate **global consumption at ~328,000 tonnes in 2022**, rising to about **578,000 tonnes by 2030** (≈7.3% CAGR) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=Global%20Strontium%20Market%20to%20Reach,year%20period)).  The US market alone was roughly 89,400 t in 2022 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=The%20U,CAGR)).  Forecasts indicate China’s demand will grow the fastest (into 100,000+ t by 2030), while Japan, Canada, and Europe grow more modestly (≈4–6% per year) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=The%20U,CAGR)).  Assuming allied countries (US+EU+Japan+others) follow similar trends (≈5–7% annual growth), combined demand could reach on the order of **200,000–250,000 t/yr** by 2030.  Key end uses remain strontium ferrite magnets (for motors/actuators), red pyrotechnic mixtures, specialty glass & ceramics (including safety glass), and medical imaging compounds ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20the%20European%20Union,ceramic%20magnets%20and%20drilling%20fluids)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=Global%20Strontium%20Market%20to%20Reach,year%20period)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: ~38,000 tons from Spain; remainder imported*  

By 2030 US/allied supply will still be overwhelmingly imported.  Spain’s Montevive mine is expected to sustain roughly **50,000 t/yr** of ore (≈38,000 t Sr) ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/economia/china-desembarca-granada-relanzar-supermina-tubos-television.html#:~:text=En%20cifras%2C%20en%20un%20a%C3%B1o,nuevas%20t%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20miner%C3%ADa%20sostenible)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/10/1261?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=The%20Montevive%20celestine%20deposit%20is,mineralogy%20of%20the%20celestine%20ore)), covering only ~15–20% of projected allied demand.  No new US, Canadian or Australian celestine mines are planned by 2030, so US production remains zero ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Republic%20of%20Korea,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)) ([www.energymining.sa.gov.au](https://www.energymining.sa.gov.au/industry/minerals-and-mining/mineral-commodities/celestite#:~:text=Celestite%20is%20widely%20distributed%20in,crystals%20in%20modern%20drainage%20channels)).  Europe’s end-of-life recycling of strontium compounds is negligible (EOL input rate ≈0%) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=The%20study%20evaluates%20the%20progression,transparency%20in%20reporting%20beneficiation%20methodologies)).  Thus the US and allies will continue to import the vast majority (>80%) of required celestine ore or processed salable strontium (carbonates, nitrates, etc.) from non-allied sources (e.g. Mexico, China, Iran) even in 2030.  In sum, Spain will remain the sole allied primary supplier (~15–20% of need), with the rest met by foreign imports ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/strontium-4#:~:text=Republic%20of%20Korea,the%20United%20States%20since%201959)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=Global%20Strontium%20Market%20to%20Reach,year%20period)).

U.S. demand ~89.4 kT (2022) and continues rising ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=The%20U,CAGR)). Europe, Japan, Canada growing ~4–6%/yr.  
• Allied Demand: Extrapolating these trends yields **US+EU+Japan+allies ≈200–250 kT/yr by 2030**. (E.g. if EU+Japan/ancillary start ~50–70 kT in 2022 and grow ~5%/yr, plus US baseline, sum approaches ~2–3× US’s 2022 level.)  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Geologic and geophysical remote sensing of marine-evaporite sequences; geochemical prospecting; drilling*  

- **Geologic mapping & soil surveys**: Target Mesozoic–Cenozoic marine evaporite/carbonate basins known to host celestine (e.g. Southern Europe, North Africa, Middle East, parts of Central Asia).  Mapping of gypsum/anhydrite-bearing stratigraphy and surface vein outcrops often reveals associated Sr-rich layers ([ausimm.eventsair.com](https://ausimm.eventsair.com/AUSIMMEventInfoPortal/14405-molten-2024/program/Portal/AgendaItemDetail?id=f5bc977a-afe9-4631-92b1-f79288a3302b#:~:text=Indian%20Institute%20of%20Technology%2C%20Hyderabad,A%20critical%20thermodynamic)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/10/1261?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=The%20Montevive%20celestine%20deposit%20is,mineralogy%20of%20the%20celestine%20ore)).  Geochemical sampling of soils and stream sediments for Sr (and Ba) anomalies can flag concealed celestine zones.  
- **Geophysical surveys**: Airborne gravity surveys can detect high-density sulfate layers (celestine 3.96 g/cm³ is denser than most carbonates), producing gravity highs over buried beds ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/10/1261?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=The%20Montevive%20celestine%20deposit%20is,mineralogy%20of%20the%20celestine%20ore)) ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=Production,dissolved%20in%20water%20and%20the)).  Magnetic surveys have limited use since celestine is non-magnetic, but resistivity/EM methods may sense the saline porewaters or clay sealing.  Hyperspectral imaging and radiometric surveys may spot gypsum/anhydrite or distinctive clay alteration patterns over celestine deposits ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/10/1261?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=The%20Montevive%20celestine%20deposit%20is,mineralogy%20of%20the%20celestine%20ore)) ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=concentrate%20its%20main%20bearing%20minerals%2C,ceramic%20magnets%20and%20drilling%20fluids)).  
- **Geochemical tracing**: Stream-sediment and soil geochemistry downstream of prospective units can trace Sr anomalies from weathered celestine.  Testing of groundwater or seepage in known or historical mine sites can confirm Sr in solution.  
- **Drilling**: Targeted RC or core drilling through identified basins is required to confirm ore.  Protocols from oil-well logging (density, sonics) can detect sulfate layers in the cores.  Once located, conventional core logging and assays determine celestine or strontianite content.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Open-pit mining; dredging of modern placers; byproduct recovery; solution mining R&D*  

- **Open-pit mining**: Conventional heavy-equipment mining works for large, shallow celestine bodies (as at Montevive).  Typical operations use drilling, blasting, excavators and haul trucks.  Equipment such as draglines or dozers move bulk rock from beds or benches.  Design best practice follows gravel-equivalent mine planning (haul roads, crushers) since celestine ore is usually >50% recyclable.  (Example: the Montevive pit covers ~330 ha and uplifts celestine-bearing strata for processing ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/economia/china-desembarca-granada-relanzar-supermina-tubos-television.html#:~:text=En%20cifras%2C%20en%20un%20a%C3%B1o,nuevas%20t%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20miner%C3%ADa%20sostenible)).)  
- **Dredging/placer mining**: If alluvial or near-shore deposits exist (eroded from uplands), hydraulic or bucket dredges could scoop celestine gravels.  No commercial strontium dredge mines are known, but analogous to other heavy-mineral placers.  
- **Byproduct recovery**: Strontium can also be recovered from existing industrial streams.  For example, flue dusts from Pb/Zn/steel furnaces (rich in Sr-Ba sulfates) have been leached to extract Sr.  Similarly, barite (BaSO₄) processing circuits may be engineered to float or precipitate the Sr fraction (often via Ba–Sr fractionation in flotation).  Research patents (e.g. US Patent 4,666,688) describe methods to isolate and convert Sr from such byproduct streams.  
- **Solution mining (R&D)**: Experimental methods include in-situ leaching of celestine deposits.  Weak acids or citrate/carbonate solutions could dissolve SrSO₄ (particularly in aquifer settings).  No commercial underground leach operations exist for Sr yet, but lab tests on microbial or low-pH extraction show some promise.  In high rainfall karstic terrains, selective pumping of Sr-enriched groundwater might be feasible.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Dense-media separation; gravity concentration; flotation; classification*  

- **Dense Medium Separation (DMS)**: Proven to pre-concentrate celestine.  In heavy-medium cyclones, celestine sinks (density ~3.96 g/cm³) while lighter gangue (e.g. dolomite, calcite) floats.  DMS circuits using magnetite or ferrosilicon media can upgrade ores to 75–85% SrSO₄ with ~85–94% Sr recovery under optimized conditions ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Beneficiation%20techniques%20such%20as%20size,improved%20celestine%20recovery%20and%20purity)).  This is practiced at Montevive and in reprocessing of its tailings ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Beneficiation%20techniques%20such%20as%20size,improved%20celestine%20recovery%20and%20purity)).  
- **Gravity concentration**: Jigging, shaking tables, spirals etc. can further refine DMS concentrates.  These gravity methods sort by density and particle size, removing inert gangue.  Effective gravity concentration has been documented in case studies for Spanish and Chinese celestine ores ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687524004941#:~:text=Beneficiation%20techniques%20such%20as%20size,improved%20celestine%20recovery%20and%20purity)).  
- **Flotation**: Celestine (and strontianite) floats with appropriate reagents.  Typically, after fine grinding, collectors (fatty acids or amines at alkaline pH) are used to float SrSO₄ or SrCO₃, leaving behind carbonates and silicates.  Flotation is usually combined with density separation: one flowsheet pre-concentrates via DMS/gravity and then uses flotation to achieve high-purity product.  Research on cell chemistry for celestine flotation dates back decades (e.g. Turkish common practice ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/publications?market=100Articles&page=23#:~:text=Survey%20www.usgs.gov%20%20,compared%20with%20947))) and remains standard in Europe and Asia.  
- **Screening/Classification**: Vibrating screens and hydrocyclones remove fines and coarses between stages.  Proper sizing boosts downstream recovery (e.g. ensuring the gravity circuit feeds pre-liberated 5–10 mm particles).  Screening rejects slimes that hinder flotation.  Modern plants may use AG/SAG mills and log-washing ahead of screens to liberate celestine.  
- **Other methods**: Magnetic or electrostatic separation are generally ineffective (celestine is non-magnetic and non-conductive).  Sensor-based ore-sorting (XRT or optical) could theoretically pick out high-Sr crystals, but no large-scale sensor sorting plants for celestine are known.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Sodium carbonate roasting; carbothermic reduction; acid dissolution/crystallization; calcination*  

- **Soda Ash Roasting (Double Decomposition)**: The dominant industrial route in Europe and elsewhere.  Finely ground celestine (+oil as binder) is mixed with Na₂CO₃ and heated in rotary kilns (≈1100–1200 °C).  Reaction: **SrSO₄ + Na₂CO₃ → SrCO₃ + Na₂SO₄**.  The sodium sulfate (salt cake) is leached out in water, leaving high-purity SrCO₃.  This process is analogous to the Ba/Na carbonate route for barium.  Texts note that boiling celestine with Na₂CO₃ readily yields SrCO₃ ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=Strontium%20sulfate%20%2C%20%5BCAS%207759,Pg.1554)).  (Note: some plants also directly carbonize SrS solution to make SrCO₃ by adding CO₂ or NH₄HCO₃.)  
- **Carbothermic Reduction (Black Ash)**: An alternative route used in Asia.  Celestine ore is mixed with coke and heated (∼1000 °C) in kilns, reducing sulfate to *strontium sulfide* (SrS), called “black ash” ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=Production,dissolved%20in%20water%20and%20the)).  The SrS is water-leached and treated with Na₂CO₃ or CO₂ to precipitate SrCO₃: **SrS + CO₂ + Na₂O (from lime or soda) → SrCO₃ + Na₂S (or Na₂CO₃)**.  The by-product H₂S (from SrS dissolution) is scrubbed as SO₂.  The black-ash method can produce >95% pure SrCO₃ from raw ores (even low grade) ([chempedia.info](https://chempedia.info/info/strontium_sulfide/#:~:text=where%20soda%20ash%20is%20added,23)).  
- **Acid Dissolution & Crystallization**: For specialty strontium salts, synthetic routes involve dissolving SrCO₃ or ore in acids.  Example: **SrCO₃ + 2 HNO₃ → Sr(NO₃)₂ + CO₂ + H₂O**.  The result is Sr(NO₃)₂ solution, which is crystallized or precipitated (e.g. by vapor evaporation or adding NH₄HCO₃) to yield purified nitrate.  Similarly, SrCl₂ can be made by leaching SrCO₃ or carbonate slag with HCl.  Ion-exchange or solvent extraction can also purify Sr²⁺ from these solutions.  These wet-chemistry steps follow the thermal roast or reduction.  
- **Calcination/Oxide Prod.**: Pure SrCO₃ can be calcined in lime kilns (around 1200–1500 °C) to decompose CO₂, producing **SrO** (strontia) for ceramics or glass refining.  SrO is stable, non-hygroscopic oxide.  (Cf. CaCO₃ → CaO).  Published kinetics show SrCO₃ decomposes at ~1200–1300 °C ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272884214012802#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fdoi)).  Strontia manufacturers may reflux strontia with water to get Sr(OH)₂ or SrCO₃ as needed.  
- **Fractional Precipitation**: To achieve ultra-pure Sr salts (<ppm Ba/Ca), stepwise pH adjustment is used.  After initial leaching, Ca and Ba hydroxides/carbonates precipitate first (at higher pH), allowing separate removal.  For example, control pH around 10–11 to precipitate Ba as Ba(OH)₂ or SrCO₃, leaving Sr²⁺ in solution, then re-carbonate and re-crystallize SrCO₃ or Sr(OH)₂.  Multiple re-dissolution/crystallization cycles can yield electronic-grade Sr(NO₃)₂ or SrCO₃.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: Mineral pre-concentration; chemical/ion-exchange effluent treatment; tailings containment; experimental phytoremediation*  

- **Pre-concentration**: Deploying DMS/gravity upfront cuts waste tonnage.  Studies at Montevive show pre-concentrating tailings or low-grade dumps to ~75–85% celestine recovers most Sr without new mining.  This minimises land disturbance and lowers acid generation.  (E.g., re-processing the old dry-screening reject now can salvage additional SrCO₃ ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/10/1261?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=The%20Montevive%20celestine%20deposit%20is,mineralogy%20of%20the%20celestine%20ore)).)  
- **Wastewater Treatment**: Mine/process effluents containing Sr²⁺ (from acid leach or process water) are treated by precipitation.  Commonly, lime or soda ash is added to precipitate Sr as carbonate or hydroxide: **Sr²⁺ + Na₂CO₃ → SrCO₃↓**.  Ion-exchange resins (e.g., sulfonated styrene-divinylbenzene) or natural zeolites (e.g. clinoptilolite) selectively capture Sr²⁺.  Adjusting pH and redox is critical to meet environmental discharge limits.  Literature on Sr removal from nuclear wastewaters is also applicable here.  
- **Tailings Management**: Celestine mine tailings (often mixed with gypsum) are stored in lined impoundments.  The high SrSO₄ content tailings are not highly soluble, so leachate risk is moderate, but containment is still needed.  Neutralizing any sulfide (if any) and recycling process water avoids tailings ponds acidification.  Because gypsum/anhydrite co-precipitates Sr and Ca, natural co-locating of tailings can act as a buffer barrier for Sr migration.  Engineered covers (limestone layers) can immobilize residual Sr via co-precipitation.  
- **Phytoremediation (research)**: Some plants (e.g. sorghum, sunflower) can uptake Sr via Ca pathways.  Experimental “Sr farms” or wetland filters have been proposed to polish weak Sr-rich waters.  These are still at lab/field-study stage; no large-scale deployments exist.  They might one day treat low-level Sr effluent (e.g. from dismantled CRT recycling) by sequestering Sr in biomass for later harvest.  
- **Circular Economy**: Today’s recycling is negligible (EOLRIR ~0%).  Efforts are being studied to recover Sr from industrial wastes: for example, SRCO₃ from CRT funnel glass cullet (still produced by some glass recyclers), from spent ferrite magnets via magnetic separation + leaching, or from old Zn chemical residues.  Regulatory trends to monitor Sr<sup>2+</sup> in mining discharges will likely spur such recovery schemes.

## Key Bottleneck summary  
The U.S. and its allies have essentially *no* domestic stratified strontium resources and no major processing plants for the material.  Advanced ore upgrading using dense-media separation and high-temperature conversion units (soda-ash roasters at ≈1100–1200 °C or carbon-reduction kilns >1000 °C) would be required to produce Sr carbonate/nitrates.  Such facilities are lacking outside Spain.  Consequently, even after discovering a new ore deposit, the lack of both **ore** and **processing infrastructure** ensures continued reliance on imports.  Spain’s ~38,000 t/yr Sr content (from Montevive) can meet only <20% of foreseeable allied demand by 2030 ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/economia/china-desembarca-granada-relanzar-supermina-tubos-television.html#:~:text=En%20cifras%2C%20en%20un%20a%C3%B1o,nuevas%20t%C3%A9cnicas%20de%20miner%C3%ADa%20sostenible)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/03/16/2629021/0/en/Global-Strontium-Market-to-Reach-578-1-Thousand-Metric-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=Global%20Strontium%20Market%20to%20Reach,year%20period)).
