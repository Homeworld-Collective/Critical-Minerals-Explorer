## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
Ruthenium is not mined in isolation but recovered as a minor byproduct from platinum‐group metal (PGM) ores. In practice, the United States has essentially **no primary Ru production**.  The two U.S. PGM mines (Stillwater and East Boulder, Montana) produce Pt–Pd-rich ores (~3.3 t 2E [Pt+Pd] in Q3 2023 ([www.irw-press.com](https://www.irw-press.com/en/news/operationsupdate-sibanye-stillwater-h1-2023_72489.html?isin=ZAE000259701#:~:text=,R%2F2Eoz))) with virtually **zero reported Ru output** ([www.irw-press.com](https://www.irw-press.com/en/news/operationsupdate-sibanye-stillwater-h1-2023_72489.html?isin=ZAE000259701#:~:text=PGM%20production%204E%2F2E%20%20,)).  Likewise, Canada’s sole PGM producer (Impala Canada’s Lac des Iles, Ontario) yields primarily palladium and platinum; its Ru content is negligible and not separately reported.  Australia, Europe (including Norway, Iceland), and Japan have no significant native Ru-bearing mines – any recovered Ru is on the order of **kilograms per year at most** from byproduct streams.  In effect, US/allied “domestic” Ru mine production is essentially **0 t/yr**.  (By contrast, world supply is dominated by South Africa and Russia; North America contributes only ~1% of global Ru ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=%3A)).)

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Ruthenium demand is driven by high-tech industries.  Key uses include electrical/electronic components, advanced catalysts, and coatings.  For example, ruthenium is widely used in **hard-disk drive (HDD) thin films and chip resistors** ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/use-of-ruthenium-in-fuel-cells-set-to-turn-down-as-green-hydrogen-trend-turns-up-heraeus-2021-05-04#:~:text=On%20the%20product%20line%20that,at%20this%20point%20in%20time)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2119153-us-hrc-prices-continue-to-fall-on-weak-demand#:~:text=resistance%20that%20is%20very%20important,used%20for%20capacitors%20and%20other)) and in **automotive and fuel-cell catalysts** (enhancing CO tolerance) ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/use-of-ruthenium-in-fuel-cells-set-to-turn-down-as-green-hydrogen-trend-turns-up-heraeus-2021-05-04#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWe%20believe%20that%20the%20use,watch%20attached%20Creamer%20Media%20video)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/05/2737341/0/en/Ruthenium-Market-to-Hit-USD-819-2-Million-by-2030-With-a-5-CAGR.html#:~:text=Ruthenium%20,cancer%20agents%20for%20MRI%20imaging)).  In the U.S., those sectors translate to roughly **2–2.5 t/yr** of Ru today (US market ~$66.2 M in 2022 ([www.fortunebusinessinsights.com](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/u-s-ruthenium-market-109109#:~:text=The%20U,during%20the%20forecast%20period)), implying ~2.1 t at ~$1,000/oz).  Assuming ~5% annual growth (per market forecasts ([www.fortunebusinessinsights.com](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/u-s-ruthenium-market-109109#:~:text=The%20U,during%20the%20forecast%20period))), U.S. demand could approach **3–4 t/yr by 2030**.  Allied demand (Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia) is smaller but rising: Europe’s electronics/automotive sectors and Japan’s semiconductor industry add another couple of tons.  In total, US+allies might demand on the order of **4–6 t/yr by 2030**.  (For context, global Ru demand is only ~20–25 t/yr now ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/09/05/2737341/0/en/Ruthenium-Market-to-Hit-USD-819-2-Million-by-2030-With-a-5-CAGR.html#:~:text=Ruthenium%20,cancer%20agents%20for%20MRI%20imaging)), growing to ~25–30 t by 2030 under a ~5% CAGR.)  Major demand drivers (electronics miniaturization, EV supercapacitors, 5G/AI chips, green hydrogen catalysts) imply steady growth ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/01/09/3006843/28124/en/Ruthenium-Strategic-Industry-Research-Report-2024-2030-Competitive-Analysis-of-American-Elements-Apeiron-Synthesis-BASF-Dyesol-Heraeus-Johnson-Matthey-Merck-Oxkem-Strem-Chemicals-T.html#:~:text=What%20Are%20the%20Key%20Factors,and%20lifespan%20of%20these%20devices)) ([www.fortunebusinessinsights.com](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/u-s-ruthenium-market-109109#:~:text=Increasing%20Product%20Adoption%20in%20the,Industry%20to%20Drive%20Market%20Growth)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
With essentially no new U.S./allied mines, ruplings Ru supply must come from **recycled feedstock plus imports**.  Domestic supply in 2030 will rely on reprocessing PGM sources (autocatalysts, electronic scrap) and allied imports.  For example, Sibanye-Stillwater’s U.S. recycling operations processed ~873 t of spent catalysts in Q3 2023, yielding ~2.25–2.6 t of Pt/Pd/Rh ([www.irw-press.com](https://www.irw-press.com/en/news/operationsupdate-sibanye-stillwater-h1-2023_72489.html?isin=ZAE000259701#:~:text=US%20PGM%20Recycling%20,4%2C715)) (with trace Ru).  Allied nations similarly recycle PGMs, but recovered Ru is only a few hundred kilograms annually.  Thus, US/allied **net supply** to meet ~4–6 t demand in 2030 will be almost entirely imported PGM concentrates or chemical intermediates.  In practice, this means sourcing material from major producers (SA, Russia) or global recyclers, since no domestic PGM refining exists to capture Ru onshore.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Airborne/ground geophysical surveys:** Airborne magnetics and EM are essential to locate Ni–Cu–PGM sulfide deposits (e.g. detecting the Bushveld, Stillwater or Norilsk intrusions).  Many PGM occurrences are associated with magnetite-rich layers in layered mafic intrusions; high-resolution gravity surveys can also highlight dense ultramafic layers.  Geophysics thus guides targeting of prospective layered intrusions.  
• **Geological mapping and structural analysis:** Identifying mafic–ultramafic intrusive bodies (e.g. the Bushveld Complex limbs) is critical ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=In%20South%20Africa%2C%20the%20PGM,expensive%20techniques%20required%20for%20material)).  Regional mapping of Archean cratons (Canada, Australia) or mobile belts helps pinpoint PGE-bearing sills/reefs.  Tectonic models (Sudbury impact basin, Slave Craton, Great Dyke of Zimbabwe) inform prospecting.  
• **Geochemical sampling:** Soil, stream-sediment and till geochemistry (sampling soils, heavy-mineral concentrates, glacial tills) can detect anomalous Pt, Pd or pathfinder elements (Ni, Cu, Co, Cr).  Multi-element arrays target PGE footprints even when Ru itself is too dilute to measure.  
• **Remote sensing:** Satellite/airborne IR or spectral mapping can identify alteration zones.  In rare cases (e.g. Hawaiian olivine basalts), gamma-ray radiometric surveys (U/Th) might hint at PGM-bearing carbonatites, though this is more relevant for REEs.  
• **Exploratory drilling:** Once targets are defined, core drilling (rotary or diamond) provides direct samples.  Oriented drill holes through Merensky or UG2 reefs (Bushveld) or Norilsk-type bodies confirm PGM mineralization.  Advanced downhole sensors (magnetic susceptibility, geotech sonde) can aid in situ detection.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Underground mining:** High-grade PGM reefs (Merensky, UG2, Koksyn) are typically mined by conventional underground methods (sublevel caving, bord-and-pillar or long-hole stoping). For example, the Bushveld Western Limb (Merensky Reef) is mined by mechanized bord-and-pillar, while PGM reefs can also be block-caved if thick enough.  Miller (east limb) and other projects use raiseboring and sublevel stoping. In Montana (Stillwater), sublevel stoping is used in narrow PGM veins.  
• **Open-pit mining:** Thicker, near-surface PGM zones (e.g. Platreef at Anglo’s Mogalakwena mine, Limb North, SA ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=In%20South%20Africa%2C%20the%20PGM,expensive%20techniques%20required%20for%20material))) are extracted via open-pit or strip mining.  Open-pit enables more economical removal of low-grade, wide zones.  Modern pit operations use large drill-and-blast rigs, shovels, and haul trucks, often employing highwall miners for steep dips.  
• **Ore comminution:** After extraction, ore is crushed and ground (crushers, SAG/ball mills) to liberate PGM minerals.  Due to the fine grain of some PGMs, multi-stage grinding circuits limit particle size (often to 75–150 µm) for flotability ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=processing%20of%20sulphide,a%20particular%20point%20in%20the)).  High-pressure grinding rolls or stirred mills may be used to reach ultrafine sizes (<40–80 µm) in “MIG” (Milling, Insurance, Gravity) circuits.  
• **Bulk metallurgical support:** Making the ore slurry also utilizes downstream cyclones, classifiers and deslime cyclones to control particle size.  Throughout, large-capacity pumps and cyclone clusters manage throughput (1000s of tonnes/day).  Pumpable slurries are routed to flotation/separation.

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Froth flotation:** The principal means of concentrating PGMs. Milled ore is conditioned with collectors (e.g. xanthates) and floated to produce a PGM-rich concentrate ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=processing%20of%20sulphide,a%20particular%20point%20in%20the)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=cleaner%20flotation,using%20nitrogen%20is%20still%20controversial)).  Advanced circuits use staged flotation: for example, flash flotation to recover coarse PGM grains (as at Chernogorskoye) followed by rougher and cleaner floats ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=processing%20of%20sulphide,a%20particular%20point%20in%20the)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=cleaner%20flotation,using%20nitrogen%20is%20still%20controversial)).  Depressants (e.g. cyanide, sulphate) suppress base metals or chromite when necessary, and pH is carefully controlled (often pH 8–9 for Bushveld ores).  Outotec’s Skim-Air or similar low-density flash flotators can recover fine PGMs with high recovery (≈90% for Pt/Pd) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=processing%20of%20sulphide,a%20particular%20point%20in%20the)).  
• **Gravity concentration:** Coarse PGM particles and native metals (e.g. electrum, sperrylite) are recovered by gravity methods.  Centrifugal concentrators (Knelson/GSM) capture very fine liberated PGMs, achieving significant grade boost ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=found%20in%20flotation%20tailings%20are,7)).  Dense media or jigging can also remove gangue before flotation (“MIG” scheme – Mill/Gravity-Flotation) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=match%20at%20L345%20gravity%E2%80%93flotation%20concentration,on%20the%20type%20of%20ores)).  Gravity‐flotation combinations are especially effective for low base-metal ores (e.g. some Norilsk feeds) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=match%20at%20L345%20gravity%E2%80%93flotation%20concentration,on%20the%20type%20of%20ores)).  
• **Magnetic separation:** Removal of magnetic iron (magnetite) or nickel sulfide particles prior to float may be used.  Rarely, weak paramagnetic PGMs (osmiridium) can be recovered magnetically, but usual PGM sulfides escape magnetic capture.  
• **Pressure oxidation (POX):** For refractory or lower-grade matte, pressure oxidation in autoclaves converts sulfides to oxides, preparing material for metal recovery.  Sherritt-Gordon’s sulphuric acid pressure leach (e.g. at Stillwater, Norilsk ([republicofmining.com](https://republicofmining.com/2009/01/14/a-history-of-sherritt-%E2%80%93-fifty-years-of-pressure-hydrometallurgy-at-fort-saskatchewan-%E2%80%93-by-m-e-chalkley-p-cordingley-g-freeman-j-budac-r-krentz-and-h-scheie-part-5-of-5/#:~:text=match%20at%20L53%20acid%20leaching,on%20the%20flowsheet%20at%20the))) is effectively a separation step – it solubilizes Ni/Cu and leaves Pt-group elements in solid residues.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Smelting to Matte:** PGM concentrates (often Ni–Cu sulfide concentrate) are smelted in electric or flash furnaces into Ni–Cu–PGM mattes.  For instance, Norilsk’s Suharnaya furnace produces a Cu–Ni matte.  A converter (basic oxygen furnace) then removes iron and sulfur, yielding a matte enriched in PGMs.  Impurities (Fe, Cu, Ni) are largely stripped as slag or sublimates.  
• **Hydrometallurgical refining:** The PGM-rich matte or precipitate is further treated by chemical processes.  In the Claus (Chloride–chlorine) process, mattes are ground and roasted to oxidize PGMs, then leached with HCl/HNO₃ to dissolve PGMs as chlorides.  The solution undergoes sequential **solvent extraction and precipitation**: e.g. reduction precipitation of copper/nickel, solvent extraction of Pd/Pt, leaving Ru/Rh/Ir for a final step ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=smelting%20and%20converting%20to%20produce,the%20base%20metals%20from%20the)).  Catalyst-grade purification can be achieved: e.g. Norilsk’s Nadezhda refinery produces **99.90% Ru** (and Rh, Os) and 99.95% Pt/Pd ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=smelting%20and%20converting%20to%20produce,the%20base%20metals%20from%20the)).  Specialized extractants (e.g. dialkyl sulfides) and reductants (H₂O₂, SO₂) are used to selectively separate Ru from other PGMs.  
• **Chemical precipitation and distillation:** Remaining Rh/Ru/Os chlorides are precipitated (e.g. as Linde salts) and then thermally distilled or reduced.  Osmium and Ir can be driven off as volatile tetroxides for capture; ruthenium (as dioxide) is reduced into metal or salt.  Eastman-Kodak or Miller-type processes are analogous for final refining.  The end result is elemen­tary Ru or Ru→RuO₂ of >99.9% purity ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=smelting%20and%20converting%20to%20produce,the%20base%20metals%20from%20the)), suitable for evaporation, vacuum distillation, or powder manufacturing.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **PGM-catalyzed oxidants:** Ruthenium catalysts enable on-site generation of high-purity H₂O₂ for water treatment ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/platinum-group-metal-poised-to-help-protect-world-from-growing-water-pollution-threat-2024-06-05#:~:text=Coming%20to%20the%20rescue%C2%A0now%20is,are%20hard%20to%20break%20down)).  For example, MatiTech’s HPGen unit uses recycled PGM (including Ru) to electrochemically produce H₂O₂ from water and O₂.  This technology can remediate organic pollutants in mine water or drinking supplies without chemical additives ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/platinum-group-metal-poised-to-help-protect-world-from-growing-water-pollution-threat-2024-06-05#:~:text=Coming%20to%20the%20rescue%C2%A0now%20is,are%20hard%20to%20break%20down)).  
• **Passive water treatment:** Mine effluent can be treated using inert substrates (e.g. limestone drains, constructed wetlands) that neutralize acidity and precipitate dissolved metals.  While not PGM-specific, such systems are standard to manage trace heavy metal and sulphate loads from tailings seepage.  
• **Waste recycling:** Spent electronics or catalytic converters from mining/EWM facilities are recycled in launder labs (pyrometallurgy or acid leach), recovering Ru/Rh/Pt and reducing toxic waste.  New adsorption/ion-exchange media (often PGM catalysts) can also capture heavy metals from process water.  
• **Solid waste stabilization:** Tailings dams and mine dumps are capped and revegetated to prevent leaching. Any PGM-bearing wastes (e.g. spent flotation tailings) can be processed for residual metal (see below) rather than left in the environment.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **PGM Refining Capacity:** The most critical gap is in downstream processing. No U.S./allied facility currently smelts and refines Ni–Cu–PGM concentrates.  For example, Norilsk’s Nadezhda smelter-autoclave in Russia handles the only large PGM feedstocks; the U.S. has no equivalent autoclave or converter built for these ores ([republicofmining.com](https://republicofmining.com/2009/01/14/a-history-of-sherritt-%E2%80%93-fifty-years-of-pressure-hydrometallurgy-at-fort-saskatchewan-%E2%80%93-by-m-e-chalkley-p-cordingley-g-freeman-j-budac-r-krentz-and-h-scheie-part-5-of-5/#:~:text=match%20at%20L53%20acid%20leaching,on%20the%20flowsheet%20at%20the)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=smelting%20and%20converting%20to%20produce,the%20base%20metals%20from%20the)).  Without domestic smelting/autoclave capacity, even a discovered ore cannot yield Ru.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Separation:** Clandestine chemical steps (multi-stage oxide dissolution and **solvent extraction**) are required to isolate ruthenium.  Western refineries for PGMs (e.g. Johnson Matthey, Umicore) are leaching and extracting PGMs but largely rely on foreign mine concentrates.  The lack of indigenous SX plants for PGM streams means allied output must route through foreign refineries.  
• **Exploration Funding & Expertise:** Few companies focus on Ru-specific targets outside major PGM belts.  Exploration techniques (e.g. ultrafine geochemistry, integrated EM) are underfunded for PGMs in the West.  This slows discovery of any domestic deposits that could alleviate imports.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Ultimately, the bottleneck is **downstream processing**.  US/allies have virtually no indigenous refining for PGM/concentrates—no autoclave pressure leach, converting or solvent-extraction plants—so any domestic ore (if found) cannot be fully processed locally ([republicofmining.com](https://republicofmining.com/2009/01/14/a-history-of-sherritt-%E2%80%93-fifty-years-of-pressure-hydrometallurgy-at-fort-saskatchewan-%E2%80%93-by-m-e-chalkley-p-cordingley-g-freeman-j-budac-r-krentz-and-h-scheie-part-5-of-5/#:~:text=match%20at%20L53%20acid%20leaching,on%20the%20flowsheet%20at%20the)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=smelting%20and%20converting%20to%20produce,the%20base%20metals%20from%20the)). This contrasts with South Africa/Russia where integrated smelting‐hydrometallurgy unlocks Ru from nickel-copper ores. In short, even if new deposits were located, the **lack of onshore smelting/separation technology** (the Sherritt-type acid autoclave or Raney nickel reduction circuits) is the key factor limiting US/allied ruthenium supply ([republicofmining.com](https://republicofmining.com/2009/01/14/a-history-of-sherritt-%E2%80%93-fifty-years-of-pressure-hydrometallurgy-at-fort-saskatchewan-%E2%80%93-by-m-e-chalkley-p-cordingley-g-freeman-j-budac-r-krentz-and-h-scheie-part-5-of-5/#:~:text=match%20at%20L53%20acid%20leaching,on%20the%20flowsheet%20at%20the)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/1/54#:~:text=smelting%20and%20converting%20to%20produce,the%20base%20metals%20from%20the)).
