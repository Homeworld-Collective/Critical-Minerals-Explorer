## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
US domestic palladium production is currently extremely limited.  The only US mines are the Stillwater and East Boulder underground deposits (Montana) operated by Sibanye-Stillwater, which together produced on the order of only ~8–10 t in 2024 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1046686/us-mine-production-of-palladium/#:~:text=The%20mine%20production%20of%20palladium,power%20the%20majority%20of%20motor)).  Canada’s Sudbury-area Ni–Cu mines (Vale, Glencore) byproduct about 15 t/yr ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1046530/canadian-palladium-production/#:~:text=Advertisement)).  Other US-allied countries (Australia, EU nations, Japan, etc.) have no significant primary Pd mines today.  For example, no EU country reports commercial Pd mining, and Japan has none.  In total, US+allied (Canada) primary output is on the order of 20–25 t/yr (Pd content).  These volumes are dwarfed by global production (200+ t, dominated by Russia/South Africa).  USGS explicitly notes “Palladium is mined from two deposits in Montana by one company,” and that “the palladium mined in the United States is sent overseas to be refined. Secondary palladium is also refined and recycled domestically” ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=Palladium%20is%20mined%20from%20two,One%20of%20those)), underscoring that domestic production is confined to these two Montana deposits.  Allied total currently would add only a few more tons (e.g. Marathon project [below] in Canada is not yet producing).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
The vast majority of Pd demand in the US and allied nations comes from automotive catalytic converters (typically ~80% of usage).  In 2023, global auto catalysts consumed roughly 240 t Pd ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/693767/palladium-global-consumption-by-industry/#:~:text=Statista%20www,82%20percent%20of%20worldwide%20palladium)); North America alone was ~29% of global demand ([www-statista-com.ezproxy.canberra.edu.au](https://www-statista-com.ezproxy.canberra.edu.au/statistics/216144/top-world-palladium-consumers-as-percent-of-total-consumption/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20North%20America%20accounted,is%20a%20platinum%20group%20metal)).  However, by 2030 demand is projected to soften due to EV adoption.  The IEA projects electric vehicle stock will more than triple by 2030 ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2025/outlook-for-energy-demand#:~:text=The%20stock%20of%20EVs%20is,Total%20energy%20demand%20for%20road)), significantly reducing light-duty gasoline and hybrid ICE sales (and associated Pd needs).  Industry forecasts (Heraeus Precious Metals) predict a slight decline in automotive Pd demand by 2025 ([www.chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202412/12/WS675aac73a310f1265a1d2918.html#:~:text=Demand%20for%20palladium%20from%20the,metals%20forecast%20released%20on%20Tuesday)), and Nornickel projects China’s traditional Pd use falling ~29% by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nornickel-sees-new-technologies-sustaining-chinas-palladium-demand-2024-11-28/#:~:text=create%20up%20to%2015,tons%20of%20palladium%20by%202030)).  Allied countries are following similar trends (EU and US both targeting ~50% EV share).  We therefore estimate 2030 Pd demand in US+allies on the order of ~~80–120 tonnes per year~~ (a decline from ~140 tish today): roughly 50–70 t/yr in North America (down from ~70 t) and perhaps 20–30 t from Europe and Japan (down from ~40 t).  Non-automotive demand (electronics capacitors, chemical catalysts, hydrogen fuel cells) may grow modestly, but likely only offsets a fraction of the auto decline.  For instance, Nornickel is developing new Pd uses (e.g. hydrogen synthesis) to create up to 40–50 t/yr of new demand by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/nornickel-sees-new-technologies-sustaining-chinas-palladium-demand-2024-11-28/#:~:text=transition%20strategy%20encompassing%20hydrogen%20production,tons%20of%20palladium%20by%202030)), but this is largely outside US/allied markets.  In short, US/allied Pd demand by 2030 is expected to be roughly flat or slightly down versus today due to emissions policies and substitution (Pt replacing Pd in some converters ([www.chinadaily.com.cn](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202412/12/WS675aac73a310f1265a1d2918.html#:~:text=The%20adoption%20of%20tri,in%202025%2C%20according%20to%20the))).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
By 2030, domestic Pd supply in the US and allied countries will come from very limited mining plus secondary sources.  On the mining side, the only new near-term source is Canada’s Marathon PGM project (Gen Mining) in Ontario, which is expected to yield ~166,000 oz Pd per year (≈5 t/yr) over a 12–13 year life ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=,2%20Moz%20silver)).  The Marathon mine is an open-pit copper–palladium project (truck-and-shovel mining ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=The%20Company%20will%20mine%20using,and%20ore%20stockpiling%20ahead%20of))) and once started (perhaps late 2020s) would modestly raise Canada’s output.  Apart from Marathon, we see no large new US/allied Pd mines by 2030: Sibanye-Stillwater has slowed US output (cutting ~200,000 oz, ~6.2 t of Pd, in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/sibanye-close-securing-up-700-million-prepayment-deals-after-first-half-loss-2024-09-12/#:~:text=South%20African%20miner%20Sibanye%20Stillwater,The))) and deferred expansion of East Boulder, reflecting low prices.  Thus US mine output may even fall to ~5 t/yr, while Canada (Sudbury and Marathon) might reach 15–20 t.  Australia and Europe essentially add ~0–5 t (new exploration projects in Australia or Finland are years from production, if at all).  

Secondary recovery (recycling of spent catalysts, e‐scrap) will be increasingly important.  US and EU recyclers (e.g. Heraeus, Johnson Matthey) refine scrap PGMs domestically.  The 2025 JM report notes growth in Chinese catalytic recycling boosting global supply ([matthey.com](https://matthey.com/media/2025/johnson-matthey-publishes-2025-pgm-market-report#:~:text=Palladium%20was%20in%20persistent%20deficit,weak%20scrap%20volumes%20in%20other)) but similar recycling streams exist in allied regions.  We estimate recycled Pd for US+allies might reach ~10–20 t/yr by 2030 (from end-of-life vehicles), partially offsetting mine shortfalls.  Summing primary + secondary, US/allied supply in 2030 might roughly be on the order of 50–60 t/yr. This likely remains well below projected 2030 demand, implying continued import dependency (chiefly from Russia/South Africa).

- **Supply Outlook**: USGS notes only two U.S. Pd mines exist (Stillwater and East Boulder) ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=Palladium%20is%20mined%20from%20two,One%20of%20those)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemical Sampling:** PGM deposits occur in distinctive mafic–ultramafic and layered intrusion settings. Detailed field mapping identifies prospective intrusions (e.g. ultramafic complexes like the Stillwater deposit). Geochemical surveys of soils, till or stream sediments target pathfinder elements (Ni, Cu, Co, chromium) and trace PGMs. For instance, Passport to discovery: the Marathon Project (Ontario) was identified via mapping of a PGE-enriched layered gabbroic intrusion. In glaciated terrains (Canada, Scandinavia), dense mineral sampling or heavy-mineral concentration in glacial till is routinely used to trace buried PGM sources.  

• **Airborne Geophysics:** Magnetics and gravity surveys delineate dense ultramafic bodies that may host PGEs. PGM-bearing intrusions often have iron-rich minerals (magnetite, pyroxene) producing anomalies. Airborne EM (electromagnetic) surveys (e.g. VTEM or AEM) are widely applied to find conductive Ni–Cu–sulfide zones, which in turn host Pd. For example, airborne magnetic surveys have guided exploration of layered intrusions in the Canadian Shield, and ground EM was key in discovering Noront’s Eagle’s Nest deposit (Ontario).

• **Remote Sensing & GIS Modeling:** Satellite/airborne imagery (LIDAR, multispectral) helps identify fault-bound intrusive complexes. Integrated GIS models combining regional geology, historic PGE data and remote sensing guide drill targeting. Machine-learning tools are increasingly applied to geodata to rank PGE prospectivity in data-rich allied regions. 

• **Drilling & Downhole Sensing:** Diamond drilling with downhole geophysical sensors (gamma, magnetics, EM) helps penetrate covered intrusions. Deep core drilling (often >1 km for large intrusions) is advanced by real-time geochemistry analyses (e.g. using XRF tools) to assess mineralization. At Marathon, reconnaissance drilling confirmed PGE mineralization along strike of the intrusion, underscoring the role of systematic core drilling in PGE discovery.

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Conventional Mining Methods:** Allied PGM orebodies like Stillwater and Marathon are mined by open-pit or underground techniques with large machinery. For example, the Marathon project will use truck-and-shovel open-pit mining for its layered Cu–Pd ore ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=The%20Company%20will%20mine%20using,and%20ore%20stockpiling%20ahead%20of)). Underground PGM mines (if any) employ long-hole stoping or cut-and-fill mining. Mining methods focus on selective extraction of sulfide-rich units to maximize Pd grade.

• **Comminution & Froth Flotation:** Extracted ore is crushed and ground (e.g. SAG mill + ball mills) to liberate sulfide minerals. Marathon’s flow sheet uses a SAB (semi-autogenous + ball) grinding circuit followed by froth flotation ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=palladium%20concentrate%20%28%E2%80%9CCu)). Froth flotation recovers nickel–copper (and PGMs) into a sulfide concentrate. For Marathon, annual throughput is ~0.85 Mt and average Pd recovery in the flotation concentrator is ~88% ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=consisting%20of%20a%20SAG%20mill%2C,With%20the)). Modern plants utilize flotation reactors (e.g. Marathon uses Woodgrove staged flotation cells for the cleaning circuit ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=match%20at%20L248%20Reactors%20previously,a%20TSF%20complete%20the%20flowsheet))) to maximize fine particle recovery of Pd-bearing minerals.

• **Matte Smelting and Converting:** The flotation concentrate (typically ~20–30% Cu+Ni, with PGMs) is smelted in an electric furnace to produce a Cu–Ni–PGE matte and silicate slag. Oxygen blowing in a converter then separates a blister containing most of the PGMs. This pyrometallurgical route (smelting + converting) is standard for PGM-bearing Ni–Cu ores. For example, Marathon’s concentrate would be smelted and converted to a copper–PGE matte, preparing it for downstream separation (notably similar to existing Ni–Cu smelter technology).

• **Pressure Oxidation (if required):** Some PGM ores with refractory (copper/iron) sulfides may warrant pressure oxidation (autoclaving) or oxidative roasting. While not widely used for primary PGMs in allied countries, pressure oxidation (e.g. combining oxygen and SO₂ under pressure) can decompose sulfide minerals to liberate PGMs for recovery. If any allied deposits contain arsenic or recalcitrant minerals, autoclave leaching could become key extraction tech.

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** To extract Pd from anode slimes or matte, sulfuric or chlorine leaching is employed to dissolve base metals (Ni, Cu, Co) into solution, leaving a PGM-rich residue. For instance, in Marathon’s flowsheet a strong acid leach dissolves Ni/Cu before Pd separation. Modern processes like pressure oxidation or chloride leaching (e.g. Autoclave/oxygen han process) can treat PGM matte. Lab tests for Marathon indicate ~88% Pd recovery through its hydromet circuits ([www.businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230330005863/en/Generation-Mining-Delivers-Updated-Feasibility-Study-for-Canada%E2%80%99s-Next-Critical-Mineral-Mine---the-Marathon-Palladium-Copper-Project#:~:text=consisting%20of%20a%20SAG%20mill%2C,With%20the)), demonstrating effective separation of Pd into concentrate versus tailings.

• **Solvent Extraction & Ion Exchange:** Once in solution, palladium is separated using selective extractants. Organophosphorus reagents (e.g. D2EHPA or Cyanex) and amine quaternary salts can remove base metals or recover PGMs. Split-anion extraction (using Ali®quat 336/NH₄Cl) is a classic technique to separate Pd(II) from Pt and Rh in chloride media. Ion-exchange resins (e.g. strong base anion resins) selectively bind PdCl₄²⁻ and PtCl₆²⁻ complexes for elution. These technologies enable purification by stepwise extraction of Pd to produce a nearly pure Pd-bearing solution.

• **Precipitation Processes:** Palladium is often recovered from solution by reducing agents. For example, adding ferrous chloride or formic acid to Pd(II) solution precipitates metallic Pd (so-called “Pd black”). Electrorefining can also separate Pd: in autoclave gold refining, Pd is sometimes precipitated in split-cell electrolysis. In industrial practice, precipitating Pd as ammonium hexachloropalladite, then decomposing to sponge Pd, is common. Research advances include one-step co-reduction methods to separate PGMs simultaneously ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Conceptual-flow-sheet-for-separation-of-rhodium-palladium-platinum-and-gold-from_fig10_347506697#:~:text=Conceptual%20flow%20sheet%20for%20separation,anion%20extraction%20using)).

• **Membrane & Solid-State Methods:** Emerging technologies like membrane electrolysis or metal–organic frameworks offer high selectivity. For example, polymer inclusion membranes with carrier molecules can separate Pd from mixed solutions. These are still largely experimental but could augment traditional solvent/precipitation techniques.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Hydrochloric Acid & Aqua Regia Refining:** Purification of palladium metal typically uses hydrochloric acid or aqua regia to dissolve the metal, followed by chemical reduction or distillation. In aqua regia, Pd dissolves as PdCl₂; adding NaCl precipitates Pd as [PdCl₄]²⁻ salt, which can then be filtered and reduced (e.g. with formic acid). This wet-chemical route is standard in centralized refineries. Industrial refiners (Heraeus in U.S., Johnson Matthey and Umicore in Europe) use multi-stage chemistry to produce >99.95% Pd. USGS notes that PGMs from domestic sources are often ‘‘sent overseas to be refined’’ ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=restructured%20its%20operations%20owing%20to,refined%20and%20recycled%20domestically%20along)), underscoring that these wet-chemical processes are typically done outside the US.

• **Electrorefining:** Specialized electrolytic cells can refine palladium to very high purity. In one approach, PdCl₂ solution is used in chlor-alkali cells: Pd(II) plates onto a cathode. This is more common for Pt (Sheldahl cell) but can be adapted for Pd. Electrorefining produces extremely pure Pd (99.99+%) for electronics and corporation use. Allied labs and refineries maintain smaller electrorefinery setups to bolster purity (e.g. for catalyst-grade Pd sponge).

• **Halogen Distillation:** Refined PGMs are sometimes purified by distillation. Many PGMs form volatile organometallic species (like Pd acetate) or halides. For example, Pd tetra-ammine complexes can be vaporized under vacuum to separate it from less volatile Pt and Rh. Distillation (sublimation) of PdCl₂ at ~800–1000 °C under inert gas is also used for final purification in research/production settings.

• **Catalytic Refinement:** Final purification of Pd often exploits its chemistry: Pd sponge can be ‘‘cleaned’’ by passing H₂ gas through PdCl₂ at 300 °C to form Pd metal and HCl. This is used in situ in chemical plants refining Pd-containing solutions. Advanced approaches also use supercritical CO₂ extraction of Pd complexes for solvent-free recovery.

• **Nano-precipitation and IDM (Ion-Exchange Membrane):** Newer research includes precipitating ultra-fine Pd (≈nm) from organics or using ion exchange membranes with selective uptake. While mostly experimental, these could eventually allow very high selectivity and lower waste, and are of interest in PMG (precious metal recovery) research.

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Carbon Mineralization of Tailings:** PGM mine tailings (often ultramafic rock) are naturally alkaline. Researchers exploit this by passing CO₂ through crushed tailings to form stable carbonate minerals. For example, tests on Stillwater Mine tailings (Montana) show significant Ca/Mg content that spontaneously reacts with CO₂, permanently storing carbon while neutralizing acidity ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/8/844#:~:text=platinum%20group%20metals%20%28PGMs%29,tailings%20samples%20have%20been%20characterized)). This mineral carbonation also immobilizes trace metals (Pd, Ni, etc.) in solid form, serving as a tailings remediation strategy.

• **Sulfate-Reducing Bioreactors:** Bioremediation using sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can treat PGM mine drainage. In engineered wetland or reactor systems, SRB consume organics and reduce SO₄²⁻ to sulfide, precipitating metals as insoluble sulfides (e.g. PdS, FeS). While proven for Zn/Cu, SRB systems scaled to Ni–Cu–PGM mines can remove residual heavy metals (and possibly Pd/Rh) from effluent. This tech has been piloted in South African PGM mine water treatment, and could apply to any PGM tailings site to meet discharge standards.

• **Alkaline Neutralization and Co-precipitation:** PGMs are often left with acid-generating gangue. In tailings ponds, adding lime or limestone neutralizes acidic water, causing co-precipitation of Pd (as hydroxide or sulfide) and other metals. Many sites use layered lime beds or high-density sludge (HDS) reactors. For example, Norwegian Ni/PGE mines use lime dosing of seepage to immobilize metals before release. Such chemical stabilization is standard “end-of-pipe” treatment at wet PGM facilities.

• **Phytoremediation:** Certain plants (e.g. mustard, alpine pennycress) hyperaccumulate heavy metals and are being tested on PGM tailings. These plants take up metals from soil and water; harvest and disposal of the biomass removes contamination. Pilot studies (e.g. at small platinum tailings sites) have shown 1–5% uptake of residual Pd/Ni after seasons of growth. Though slow, combining phytoremediation with other barriers (liner+capping) can gradually clean low-grade tailings.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Domestic Refining Capacity:** The principal bottleneck is the lack of high-capacity PGM refining and separation infrastructure in Allied countries.  USGS explicitly states that U.S.-mined palladium is ‘‘sent overseas to be refined’’ ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=restructured%20its%20operations%20owing%20to,refined%20and%20recycled%20domestically%20along)), indicating that domestic hydrometallurgical/refining technologies (e.g. large-scale solvent extraction or chlorination plants) are insufficient or nonexistent.  In practical terms, even if new mines like Marathon come online, the extracted Pd cannot be fully processed to metal in-country.  Allied refiners depend on foreign smelters and refineries (primarily Russian/South African), creating a technology and security gap.  Without investment in domestic refining technologies (e.g. modern chlorination/precipitation plants), US and allied producers cannot convert mined ore to marketable Pd internally.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Allied palladium production is fundamentally limited by both geology and processing technology.  Geologically there are only a few known domestic deposits (two in the US, none in EU/Australia) ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=Palladium%20is%20mined%20from%20two,One%20of%20those)). Technologically, the lack of domestic Pd-refining capacity in the US/allies forms a bottleneck: as noted by USGS, mined Pd must currently be shipped abroad for refining ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20255021/full#:~:text=restructured%20its%20operations%20owing%20to,refined%20and%20recycled%20domestically%20along)). In short, even if new mines are developed, the absence of advanced in-country hydrometallurgical and fabrication infrastructure constrains Allied production. Without breakthroughs in both exploration/mining and downstream refining, US/allied supply will remain a small fraction of demand, necessitating continued reliance on imports.
