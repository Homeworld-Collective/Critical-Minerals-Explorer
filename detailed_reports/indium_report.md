## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States** – ~0 t (no Indium mines or primary refining). The US relies entirely on secondary sources; USGS notes the U.S. “produces only secondary material” from imported or recycled feed ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1300/#:~:text=Indium%20is%20principally%20a%20byproduct,sustainable%20production%20and%20consumption%20of)).  
• **Canada** – small output (order of tens of tonnes/year) as a byproduct of base‐metal refining. Teck Resources’ Trail, BC smelter recovers trace Indium from zinc concentrates ([www.teck.com](https://www.teck.com/products/other-metals/advanced-materials#:~:text=Teck%20is%20a%20world%20leader,is%20committed%20to%20responsibly%20providing)). (Teck notes it is a “significant producer” of indium ([www.teck.com](https://www.teck.com/products/other-metals/advanced-materials#:~:text=Teck%20is%20a%20world%20leader,is%20committed%20to%20responsibly%20providing)).) Exact Canadian production is proprietary but is historically much less than major global producers.  
• **EU (Germany, Belgium, France, etc.)** – also only byproduct streams. Belgium’s Nyrstar Balen/Pelt zinc smelters produced ~18 t of refined Indium in 2023 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1499280/refinery-production-of-indium-in-belgium/#:~:text=Belgium%20produced%20an%20estimated%2018,comparison%20with%20the%20previous%20year)). France’s Nyrstar Auby (Lille region) runs an RLE (Roast-Leach-Electrolytic) zinc refinery with an on-site Indium plant (commissioned 2012) that outputs 99.998%‐pure Indium ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-auby#:~:text=The%20Auby%20smelter%20produces%20SHG,copper%20and%20indium)). Other EU refining (e.g. Finland, Poland) and scrap recovery adds only minor tonnes.  
• **Japan** – historically a top producer (~70 t in 2001 ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1300/#:~:text=produced%20in%20several%20countries%20which,sustainable%20production%20and%20consumption%20of))). Modern production continues via companies like Dowa/Nippon (e.g. Atotsu/Kagoshima) from zinc refining, though official volumes are undisclosed. Japan is understood to produce on the order of 20–50 t/year.  
• **Australia** – ~0 t currently (no operating Indium mine or smelter). Recent exploration (e.g. Iltani Resources’ Orient silver project) found substantial Ag–In mineralization ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/australia-largest-silver-indium-deposit-2025/#:~:text=%3E%20,Managing%20Director%20of%20Iltani%20Resources)), but it is not yet in production.  
• **Norway, Iceland** – 0 t (no Indium production facilities).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Projected Allied demand is on the order of **1–1.5 thousand tonnes by 2030**, given global demand ~3.42 kt ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=The%20Indium%20Market%20size%20is,driven%20datacenter)). Key drivers include:  
• **Flat-panel displays (ITO)** – the largest use (~59.8% of Indium demand in 2024 ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=%2A%20By%20application%2C%20flat,2030))). Growing shipments of TVs, monitors, smartphones, tablets (transparent conductive ITO coatings) in the US, EU and Japan will keep Indium demand high.  
• **Photovoltaics (CIGS solar)** – roughly **25 t of Indium per GW** of CIGS capacity is needed (each GIW in PV uses ~25 t In ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=The%20Indium%20Market%20size%20is,driven%20datacenter)) ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=%2A%20By%20application%2C%20flat,2030))). Announced thin-film solar plants in allied countries (U.S., Europe) could add hundreds of tonnes of demand by 2030 as CIGS/GaAs use grows.  
• **Electronics & Semiconductors** – significant Indium usage especially in specialty alloys and compounds (InP/InGaAs lasers, GaN dies, solders). Electronics and semiconductor applications already accounted for ~70% of Indium use ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=The%20Indium%20Market%20size%20is,driven%20datacenter)) ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=%2A%20By%20application%2C%20flat,2030)). Continued expansion of data centers, 5G/AI hardware, and optoelectronics in allied nations will contribute additional demand (likely hundreds of tonnes by 2030).  
• **Other minor uses** – e.g. low-melting solders, specialty alloys, cryogenic applications, are relatively small but grow modestly.  

Given the above, U.S. demand alone was ~100 t in 2020 ([studylib.es](https://studylib.es/doc/9350987/mineral-commodity-summaries-2021#:~:text=estimated%20domestic%20consumption%20of%20refined,price%2C%20was%20about%20%2440%20million)); with CAGR ~6–7%, US+allied demand likely in the **upper hundreds to over 1,000 t** by 2030 (in line with the ~3.42 kt global projection ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=The%20Indium%20Market%20size%20is,driven%20datacenter))).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Even with increased effort, domestic/allied supply will remain only a fraction of demand. Key sources by 2030 could include:  
• **Recycling (secondary supply)** – Expansion of ITO/glass recycling and e-waste recovery. Japan and Korea currently recycle the bulk of spent ITO ([studylib.es](https://studylib.es/doc/9350987/mineral-commodity-summaries-2021#:~:text=estimated%20domestic%20consumption%20of%20refined,price%2C%20was%20about%20%2440%20million)); the US and EU lag behind. If allied recycling programs scale up, they might yield on the order of **tens of tonnes per year** by 2030 (e.g. dedicated facilities recovering 30–50 t/yr from panels and electronics). EU research programs aim to reclaim ~800 t cumulatively by 2030 through improved recycling.  
• **Byproduct (enhanced)** – New process streams. For example, Teck’s Trail (BC) jarosite-leaching pilot could add ~20 t/yr of recovered In ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=under%20USD%20300%20%2Fkg%20price,third%20of%20demand%20by%202030)). Beyond that, existing zinc smelters (Nyrstar, Dowa, etc.) could continue producing on the order of 50 t/yr from concentrates/toxic dusts. No new primary Indium mines are expected, so allied output likely stays in the low hundreds of tonnes per year.  
• **Imports and Stockpiles** – The shortfall will be made up by imports from global producers. For instance, the US and EU currently import refined Indium metal from Canada, Japan, and Asia (~100–200 t/yr). Even with higher recycling and Teck’s contributions, allied domestic *supply* by 2030 might reach only ~200 t/yr, far below the 1,000+ t needed. The rest must come from international markets or strategic reserves.  

## References for volumes  
Volume data are drawn from multiple sources. For example, Statista reports global refined Indium production ~1,080 t in 2024 (China ~760 t) and Belgium ~18 t ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1060401/global-refinery-production-of-indium-by-country/#:~:text=China%20was%20the%20world%27s%20largest,glass%20conductive%20while%20remaining%20transparent)) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1499280/refinery-production-of-indium-in-belgium/#:~:text=Belgium%20produced%20an%20estimated%2018,comparison%20with%20the%20previous%20year)). The USGS Mineral Commodity Summary (2021) states US consumption ~100 t (2020) ([studylib.es](https://studylib.es/doc/9350987/mineral-commodity-summaries-2021#:~:text=estimated%20domestic%20consumption%20of%20refined,price%2C%20was%20about%20%2440%20million)). Mordor Intelligence projects world demand rising from ~2.47 kt (2025) to ~3.42 kt by 2030 ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=The%20Indium%20Market%20size%20is,driven%20datacenter)). These figures underlie our supply/demand estimates.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geochemical surveys:** Indium is dispersed in zinc–lead–tin mineral systems. Modern exploration uses multi-element ICP-MS geochemistry on soils, stream sediments or rock chips over known Zn–Cu–Sn districts. For example, sphalerite-rich (ZnS) and cassiterite-rich (Sn) veins often carry elevated In ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375674223001590#:~:text=The%20first%20collation%20of%20indium,microanalysis)). Geochemistry can flag even ppm-level In anomalies pointing to hidden orebodies.  
• **Geological mapping:** Geological models target Ag–Zn–Pb–Sn vein systems (e.g. Mississippi Valley, Broken Hill–type, tin skarns or orogenic veins). Identifying altered carbonate or skarn zones can narrow search areas. Understanding that “the richest indium sphalerite is likely in polymetallic Sn systems” helps focus mapping ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375674223001590#:~:text=The%20first%20collation%20of%20indium,microanalysis)).  
• **Geophysical methods:** Indium itself is not geophysically distinct, but Indium-bearing deposits are usually sulfide-rich. Induced polarization (IP) and ground electromagnetic (EM) surveys can locate hidden sulfide zones (e.g. disseminated sphalerite or arsenopyrite) that may host In. Negative IP anomalies at polymetallic prospects can trigger drilling for possible In.  
• **Drilling & Assay:** Once targets are defined, reverse-circulation (RC) and diamond drilling test them. Modern cores are scanned/assayed for In and pathfinders. Example: Iltani Resources’ Orient project (Queensland, Aus) used 118 RC + 5 diamond holes after geochem sampling, delineating an Ag–In vein system with Indium alongside silver ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/australia-largest-silver-indium-deposit-2025/#:~:text=%3E%20,Managing%20Director%20of%20Iltani%20Resources)).  
• **Analytical technology:** XRF and ICP-MS enable rapid detection of Indium in drill core and concentrates. Laser ablation methods are also used. These tools are standard in allied exploration labs.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Smelter roasting–leaching–electrowinning (RLE):** Industry standard at large Zn/Pb smelters. Ore concentrates or flue dust are roasted (converting sulfides to sulfates), leached in sulfuric acid, and zinc/lead are electrowon from solution. Indium follows the liquor. At Nyrstar Auby (France), the RLE circuit is coupled to an indium refinery, yielding 99.998%-pure In ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-auby#:~:text=The%20Auby%20smelter%20produces%20SHG,copper%20and%20indium)).  
• **Acid leaching of residues:** Indium-containing dusts or slimes (from Zn or Pb smelters) are treated with strong acids (HCl or H₂SO₄). Example: lead anode slimes from Imperial Smelting furnaces are often chlorinated and leached to free Indium. Teck’s Trail jarosite process uses HCl leach on Zn refinery residue, recovering ~20 t/yr ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=under%20USD%20300%20%2Fkg%20price,third%20of%20demand%20by%202030)).  
• **Solvent extraction (SX):** A critical hydromet step. Acidic In-laden solution is contacted with organic extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, Versatic acid, or MIBK) that selectively bind In³⁺. The loaded organic is then stripped to produce pure In solution. (For instance, Mitsui’s Ehime smelter historically used MIBK extraction for In.)  
• **Ion-exchange and adsorption:** Specialized ion-exchange resins or chelating columns can concentrate Indium from dilute solutions, capturing In while rejecting major metals. Regeneration of the resin provides a pure In eluate for further processing.  
• **Electrowinning (electrolytic refining):** Finally, purified In solution is electrolyzed. Metallic indium plates onto cathodes at low current density (much like copper EW). This step yields semipure indium ingots (>99.5%) that then go to final refining. (Nyrstar’s Auby electrowins zinc and then separately plates indium from the acid recycle.)  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Liquid–liquid extraction:** The backbone of most In recovery flowsheets. Extractants like di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) or Versatic acids are used to separate In from competing metals (Zn, Cd, Fe, etc.). For example, after leaching, a mixer-settler SX train strips out Fe/Al and Zn, then selectively removes In.  
• **Selective precipitation:** After SX or ion-exchange, indium can be precipitated (pH adjustment) as In(OH)₃ or as sulfide by adding sulfide reagents. This step cleans up minor impurities before final refining.  
• **Electrorefining:** Beyond initial EW, high-purity refining may involve dissolving crude In in HCl and re-electrolyzing to eliminate tramp impurities. The Clare Patent (Ni–Cd batteries) for In might be cited here.  
• **Distillation:** Indium forms a volatile chloride (InCl₃) or hydride; vacuum distillation can separate remaining impurities from molten Indium. High-purity (>99.999%) Indium is achieved by multi-stage vacuum distillation (analogous to zinc chloride distillation in Zn refining).  
• *Example:* Nyrstar’s Auby plant demonstrates full separation – its Indium refinery (RLE + SX + EW + distillation) produces 99.998% In metal ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-auby#:~:text=The%20Auby%20smelter%20produces%20SHG,copper%20and%20indium)).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Vacuum distillation:** Taking advantage of indium’s low boiling point (~156°C), vacuum distillation is used to strip residual impurities. InCl₃ is distilled off and decomposed to metal. This yields very high-purity indium ingots.  
• **Zone refining:** A molten indium rod is passed through a narrow heating coil; impurities segregate and are swept to one end of the rod. Repeat passes can produce 6N (99.9999%)‐grade indium.  
• **Hydrogen reduction:** Indium oxide or chloride can be reduced with H₂ gas at high temperature to metal, followed by vacuum refinement. This is a common metallurgical step for final purification.  
• **Molten-salt electrolysis:** In advanced setups, InCl₃ can be electrolyzed in molten salt (e.g. InCl₃–KCl) to yield ultra-pure metal.  
• *Industrial example:* Nyrstar’s output grade (99.998%) ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-auby#:~:text=The%20Auby%20smelter%20produces%20SHG,copper%20and%20indium)) implies intensive purification (likely multi-stage distillation and/or zone refining) after plating.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Jarosite tailings reprocessing:** Convert waste from zinc refining into recoverable In. Teck’s pilot project leaches jarosite (a goethite-like residue) to extract indium, which could yield ~20 t/yr ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=under%20USD%20300%20%2Fkg%20price,third%20of%20demand%20by%202030)). This exemplifies recovering In from process waste.  
• **Dust/cinder leaching:** Waste dusts (“cinder,” slimes) from lead‐smelters can be neutralized and leached for In. For example, historical Yunnan operations removed In from lead-back residues by leaching and salt roasting (a form of in-situ remediation).  
• **E-waste/Ito glass recycling:** While technically recycling, collecting end-of-life LCD panels or electronics and chemically extracting InOₓ is a remediation of waste stocks. Processes involve crushing glass and leaching ITO, then SX/EW to recover In. (Japan’s recycling programs effectively remediate ITO waste.)  
• **Ion exchange/adsorption from effluent:** Wastewaters from smelters can be treated: selective In capture via resin/adsorbent beds, then elution to concentrate In for reuse (remediating water and extracting resource).  
• **Phytoremediation (research stage):** Some microbes or hyperaccumulator plants can uptake In; experimental biotechnologies are being studied to recover In from dilute solutions or tailings, but are not yet commercial.

• USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries (2021, 2023) – Annual stats on US and world Indium consumption (e.g. US ~100 t in 2020 ([studylib.es](https://studylib.es/doc/9350987/mineral-commodity-summaries-2021#:~:text=estimated%20domestic%20consumption%20of%20refined,price%2C%20was%20about%20%2440%20million))).  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Feedstock availability:** With no primary indium mining in the U.S./allied countries, the supply bottleneck is the lack of concentrate. The U.S. produces only secondary (recycled) Indium ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1300/#:~:text=Indium%20is%20principally%20a%20byproduct,sustainable%20production%20and%20consumption%20of)). Generating new domestic In supply requires unlocking byproduct streams.  
• **Jarosite recovery scale:** Techniques like Teck’s HCl jarosite process can only add ~20 t/yr ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=under%20USD%20300%20%2Fkg%20price,third%20of%20demand%20by%202030)). Without major expansion of such niche technologies (or new Zn/Pb smelters), allied extraction capacity remains minimal.  
• **Recycling infrastructure:** Allied nations lack large-scale ITO/e-waste recycling compared to Asia. Building those plants (solvent extraction lines, electrolytic refineries, etc.) is a technological and economic hurdle. Until that is solved, allied production cannot rise to meet demand.  
• **Specialized refining:** Even if Indium feed is obtained, replicating facilities like Nyrstar’s (RLE + Indium refinery ([www.nyrstar.com](https://www.nyrstar.com/operations/metals-processing/nyrstar-auby#:~:text=The%20Auby%20smelter%20produces%20SHG,copper%20and%20indium))) is costly. The concentration and purity requirements for electronics mean each step must be precise. Scaling these processes domestically is a major bottleneck.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The critical bottleneck is that Indium comes almost exclusively as a dilute byproduct; the US/allied nations have no native primary Indium ore bodies ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1300/#:~:text=Indium%20is%20principally%20a%20byproduct,sustainable%20production%20and%20consumption%20of)). Thus, production hinges on complex recovery technologies applied to zinc/lead residues. Very few facilities exist – for example, Teck’s jarosite processing (+20 t/yr) ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=under%20USD%20300%20%2Fkg%20price,third%20of%20demand%20by%202030)) – and allied recycling remains small. In short, without new mining streams or massive recycling build-out, domestic Indium supply will stay constrained relative to forecast demand ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/indium-market#:~:text=under%20USD%20300%20%2Fkg%20price,third%20of%20demand%20by%202030)) ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1300/#:~:text=Indium%20is%20principally%20a%20byproduct,sustainable%20production%20and%20consumption%20of)).
