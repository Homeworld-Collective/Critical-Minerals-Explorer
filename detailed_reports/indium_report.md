## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
Indium occurs only as trace (tens of ppm) byproduct in zinc (and some tin) ores, with no known primary indium deposits ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=It%20is%20generally%20considered%20that,and%20alloys%2C%20among%20others%2C%20are)).  Thus allied supply depends entirely on recovering indium from zinc‐ or lead‐smelter residues and limited recycling.  For example, only the Teck Trail (Canada) and Nyrstar Auby/Balen (Belgium/France) zinc refineries currently recover indium in North America and Europe ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)).  Allied recycling of indium–tin oxide (ITO) or electronics is minimal (estimated <10% of demand) due to low grades and poor collection.  Without new zinc‐refining projects with indium circuits or major expansion of scrapped‐ITO recycling, domestic supply will cover only a small fraction of projected demand (≈15–20% by 2030).  The U.S. is 100% import‐reliant on indium ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-indium-deposits-united-states#:~:text=minerals%20published%20by%20the%E2%80%AFUSGS,Republic%20of%20Korea%20and%20France)), and China is the dominant global producer (supplying >50% of refined output ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-indium-deposits-united-states#:~:text=minerals%20published%20by%20the%E2%80%AFUSGS,Republic%20of%20Korea%20and%20France))), so import dependence will persist in the near term.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States** – 0 t of primary indium (no domestic zinc smelter recovery) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-indium-deposits-united-states#:~:text=minerals%20published%20by%20the%E2%80%AFUSGS,Republic%20of%20Korea%20and%20France)).  Only a few tons per year (<10 t) are recovered from recycled ITO or electronics. (The USGS reports US primary indium output as zero ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/news/technical-announcement/usgs-updates-mineral-database-indium-deposits-united-states#:~:text=minerals%20published%20by%20the%E2%80%AFUSGS,Republic%20of%20Korea%20and%20France)), with all consumption met by imports.)  
• **Canada** – ~35–40 t/yr, from Teck Resources’ Trail, BC zinc‐lead smelter (the only North American zinc refinery with an indium recovery circuit) ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)).  
• **EU (Belgium, France, Germany)** – ~40–50 t/yr combined.  Belgium’s Nyrstar Balen/Pelt smelter and France’s Nyrstar Auby smelter each recover indium (Balen ~18 t in 2023, Auby ~15–20 t) ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)). (Germany has no large zinc smelter; any production is minor, from recycling.)  
• **Japan** – ~30–40 t/yr (vs. ~70 t two decades ago).  Dowa and JX Nippon Mining recover indium in zinc smelting and from ITO scrap; Japan has the world’s most advanced ITO recycling (reportedly ≈60% recovery efficiency) ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)).  
• **South Korea** – ~150 t/yr (current output).  Korea Zinc’s Onsan refinery produces ~150 t of indium annually, making it one of the world’s leading indium producers ([pulse.mk.co.kr](https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/all/11252637#:~:text=The%20company%20operates%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,indium%20imports)). (This single facility accounts for roughly 30% of U.S. indium imports ([pulse.mk.co.kr](https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/all/11252637#:~:text=The%20company%20operates%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,indium%20imports)).)  
• **Australia** – 0 t (no operating indium circuit).  The Mount Isa zinc smelter (closed 2020) is not producing indium; exploration (e.g. Iltani Resources’ Mount Stedman) has identified silver–indium mineralization, but no development commitments are in place.  
• **Norway, Iceland** – 0 t (no indium recovery facilities in operation).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Global indium consumption is forecast to reach ~3,500 t/yr by 2030; Western (US+allies) demand is projected ~1,200–1,500 t/yr (≈35–40% of global).  Key end‐uses driving this demand growth include:  
• **Flat-panel displays (ITO)** – ~45–50% of indium demand.  Indium tin oxide (ITO) coatings for LCD/OLED/etc. screens remain virtually irreplaceable for transparent electrodes ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/indium#:~:text=You%20can%E2%80%99t%20have%20touchscreens%20without,Image%20credit%3A%20By)).  Allied display manufacturing and touchscreen production alone will require on the order of 600–700 t/yr of indium by 2030.  
• **Semiconductors & electronics** – ~25–30%.  Includes indium phosphide (InP) lasers, indium-gallium arsenide detectors, and indium‐based solder alloys.  Expansion of 5G infrastructure, data centers, and photonics drives demand.  Allied electronics + ICT industries could consume ~350–400 t/yr by 2030.  
• **Photovoltaics (CIGS solar)** – ~15–20%.  CIGS (Cu–In–Ga–Se) thin‐film modules use about 10–15 t indium per GW.  If allied deployment of CIGS reaches 20–30 GW by 2030, indium demand from PV would be ~200–300 t/yr (20 GW×15 t/GW ≈300 t) ([www.pv-magazine.com](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2021/08/11/indium-supply-not-an-issue-for-cigs-industry/#:~:text=The%20researchers%20said%20the%20indium,hundred%20kilograms%2C%20or%20even%20lower)).  
• **Other applications** – ~10%.  Alloys (low-melting solders, fusible plugs), thermal interface materials, transparent conductive coatings (aside from ITO), catalysts, and specialty chemicals, together ~100–150 t/yr.  

Current Western consumption (2023) is ~400–500 t/yr (US ~120 t, EU ~150 t, Japan ~100 t, Korea ~80 t), so demand is expected to triple by 2030. (Data sources: USGS and industry estimates.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Even with major investments, allied production will remain a small fraction of demand in 2030: estimated 200–300 t/yr vs. ~1,200–1,500 t demand.  Key components of supply are:  
• **Primary byproduct production** – ~150–200 t/yr.  Existing zinc refineries with indium circuits (Korea Zinc, Teck Trail, Nyrstar Auby/Balen) may optimize processes, but no new zinc smelters with indium recovery are planned in the West ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)) ([pulse.mk.co.kr](https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/all/11252637#:~:text=The%20company%20operates%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,indium%20imports)).  (Korea Zinc alone produces ~150 t/yr ([pulse.mk.co.kr](https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/all/11252637#:~:text=The%20company%20operates%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,indium%20imports)).)  
• **Secondary recycling** – ~80–120 t/yr potential.  Enhanced ITO/electronics recycling could yield significant indium.  For example, Japan’s high-efficiency LCD recycling might approach 40–50 t/yr, and EU/US initiatives (e.g. display panel recovery programs) could contribute another 40–70 t/yr if fully implemented.  (Recycling remains technologically challenging and currently captures only a small share of consumed indium ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=It%20is%20generally%20considered%20that,and%20alloys%2C%20among%20others%2C%20are)).)  
• **Historical residue reprocessing** – ~20–30 t/yr.  Treating legacy zinc refinery residues (“jarosites” and goethites) by acid leaching could recover indium.  Teck reports pilot jarosite leaching projects (using hot HCl/H₂SO₄) to extract indium (and other metals) from Trail’s processing residue. If commercialized, such projects might add ~10–15 t/yr.  
• **Import dependency** – ~1,000–1,200 t/yr shortfall.  The vast gap will require imports of refined indium.  China (600–700 t/yr) will remain the primary supplier, supplemented by processing of zinc residues from Peru, Russia, Australia, etc.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
(Refer to [References for mining technologies]). Indium exploration focuses on multi‐element geoscience because indium is typically a trace constituent (often <100 ppm) in zinc and tin deposits. Common methods include:  
- **Geochemical surveys** – Soils, sediments, and rock sampling analyzed by ICP-MS can detect sub-ppm indium anomalies.  Indium often follows zinc, tin, and lead geochemical halos.  
- **Geological targeting** – Prospecting for polymetallic vein systems, tin–tungsten/cassiterite skarns, and volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) deposits. Indium tends to concentrate in sphalerite (ZnS) from epithermal systems and in cassiterite (SnO₂) from Sn–W systems ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)).  
- **Geophysics** – Induced‐polarization (IP) and electromagnetic (EM) surveys can map disseminated sulfide zones (Zn–Pb–Cu±In). Gravity surveys identify dense sulphide accumulations.  
- **Drilling & assay** – Systematic core drilling with multi‐element analysis (XRF screening plus lab ICP‐MS) is essential. Laser ablation ICP‐MS (LA-ICP-MS) on sulfide minerals (e.g. sphalerite, stannite) can locate indium-bearing phases and quantify grades at the grain scale. For example, LA-ICP-MS studies have identified indium in sphalerite at ppm levels ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/4/540#:~:text=match%20at%20L192%20Indium%20is,the%20most%20important%20source%20of)).  
- **Analytical advances** – In-situ microanalysis (LA-ICP-MS, nano-SIMS) and automated scanning electron microscopy with EDS/CL to find indium phases; high-throughput geochemical imaging; use of diffusion modeling to predict indium zoning.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
(Refer to [Processing of indium: a review](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0892-6875(03)00168-7) ([khazna.ku.ac.ae](https://khazna.ku.ac.ae/en/publications/processing-of-indium-a-review#:~:text=Indium%20is%20an%20important%20by,thallium%2C%20gallium%20and%20germanium%2C%20and)), [Alguacil et al., 2024] ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=It%20is%20generally%20considered%20that,and%20alloys%2C%20among%20others%2C%20are))). Competitive indium recovery methods include:  
- **Roasting–leach–electrowinning (RLE)** – A standard zinc refinery flowsheet. Zinc sulfide concentrates are roasted (900–950 °C) to ZnO; sulfur is captured as acid. In the subsequent zinc leach (H₂SO₄), indium reports to the residue (typically jarosite or goethite solid byproducts) at 10–100× enrichment relative to the original ore ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=It%20is%20generally%20considered%20that,and%20alloys%2C%20among%20others%2C%20are)). These residues are then processed as sources of indium.  
- **Chloride volatilization** – Indium forms volatile InCl₃ at ~500–600 °C. Adding NaCl/CaCl₂ to zinc calcine (chloridizing roast) causes indium to volatilize into flue dusts, which can be captured and leached. This technique selectively extracts indium (and cadmium) from Zn-bearing residues. (A commercial variant is the “chloridizing volatilization” process used in some Chinese smelters.)  
- **Pressure oxidation (POX)** – High-temperature (150–180 °C), high-pressure O₂ leaching of sulfide concentrates (or seafloor tailings) dissolves Zn, In, and other metals. Indium dissolves along with zinc and is later separated in solvent extraction.  
- **Acid leaching of residues** – Direct acid treatment of zinc flue dusts or jarosites. Hot concentrated HCl or H₂SO₄ leaching dissolves indium from iron–zinc residues. For example, acids digesting jarosite residues (with external oxidants) can achieve ~70–85% indium recovery.  
- **Bioleaching (experimental)** – Acidophilic bacteria (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans*) or bio-catalyzed processes have been studied for low-grade materials. These methods remain at pilot/development stage, not yet commercial.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
(Refer to [Solvent extraction studies](https://doi.org/10.1590/S0104-66322003000200005) ([www.scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/bjce/a/KPPM4D5y9h96XKHK8j6XyLt/?lang=en#:~:text=This%20experimental%20work%20presents%20the,least%20six%20stages%20for%20indium))). After leaching, indium is separated from base metals:  
- **Solvent extraction (SX)** – The industry standard for indium from acidic solutions. Organophosphoric acids (e.g. D2EHPA) effectively extract In³⁺. Well‐designed SX circuits (pH ~0.5–2, multiple stages) achieve >95% indium recovery with minimal co-extraction of Zn/Cd ([www.scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/bjce/a/KPPM4D5y9h96XKHK8j6XyLt/?lang=en#:~:text=This%20experimental%20work%20presents%20the,least%20six%20stages%20for%20indium)) (e.g. Fortes et al. (2003) report 96–99% In extraction). Stripping is done with stronger acid to produce a purified indium sulfate solution.  
- **Ion exchange / adsorption** – Chelating resins (e.g. iminodiacetic or phosphonic acid resins) can concentrate indium from dilute solutions (<100 mg/L). These are useful for effluent polishing or ultrapurification.  
- **Selective precipitation** – pH adjustment can precipitate indium hydroxide (In(OH)₃) at ~pH 3–4, leaving Zn in solution. Alternatively, sulfide precipitation (adding Na₂S) yields In₂S₃ selectively (since In³⁺ precipitates at higher pH than Zn²⁺). These methods can also upgrade SX eluates.  
- **Cementation** – Indium can be cemented out of concentrated solutions (>1 g/L In) by adding metallic zinc (or aluminum) dust: In³⁺ + 3Zn⁰ → 3Zn²⁺ + In⁰. This produces an indium sponge that must be purified further, but it provides a simple pre-concentration.  
- **Electrowinning (EW)** – Final refining: indium is plated from purified sulfate or chloride electrolytes onto aluminum or titanium cathodes (current density ~20–50 A/m²).  Indium cathodes (97–99.9% In) are produced in acid baths (H₂SO₄ with Zn anodes). Current efficiency is ~90–95%; the product still requires further refining to semiconductor grade.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
(Refer to [Janošević 2022](https://doi.org/10.3390/miners13040540) and [podcast] reviews).  Crude indium metal requires multiple purification steps to reach electronic purity:  
- **Vacuum distillation** – Taking advantage of indium’s low vapor pressure, vacuum distillation at ~800–1,200 °C removes volatile impurities (mainly Zn, Cd, Pb). This yields 99.99%+ pure indium but is not sufficient for 5N+ grades.  
- **Electrolytic refining** – Dissolve crude indium (≤99.9% pure) in HCl or H₂SO₄; electroplate onto pure indium cathodes at ~30–40 °C. This produces 99.999% (“5N”) indium. A literature report describes obtaining 99.9999% (“6N”) via controlled electrolysis ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/4/540#:~:text=match%20at%20L212%20Ordinary%20electrolytic,This%20process%20can%20produce)).  Typical current efficiencies are >90%.  
- **Zone refining (zone melting)** – A molten zone is passed through an indium ingot to radially segregate metallic impurities. Multiple passes can achieve “6N”+ purity (for laser/photonic grade indium). This is used only for very high-purity material due to cost.  
- **Chemical vapor transport (CVT)** – Indium is converted to volatile InCl (with HCl at ~650 °C) and then re-deposited as metal on cool surfaces. This yields ultra-pure indium (≥6N) for specialty applications. CVT is a laboratory or small-scale industrial technique.  
- **Historical methods** – Mercury amalgamation of indium (followed by steam distillation to recover In) was used in the past; it is now obsolete due to mercury hazards.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
To recover indium from waste streams and by-products:  
- **Jarosite/goethite leaching** – Treat zinc plant residues (jarosites, goethites) containing ~50–500 ppm In with hot concentrated acid (HCl or H₂SO₄ at 80–95 °C). This dissolves the indium and allows recovery by SX/EW. Pilot studies (e.g. Teck Trail) show ~70–85% In recovery. Teck currently processes ~10,000 t/yr of jarosites at Trail (for zinc recovery) and is piloting indium leaching from these residues.  
- **ITO/glass recycling** – Crushing LCD/OLED panels and leaching the indium-containing glass yields indium sulfate. Typical acid (HCl or H₂SO₄) dissolution recovers ~60–70% of the indium in scrap glass ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=At%20work%2C%20a%20process%20for,2%7D.%20The)). Japan’s specialized recyclers process thousands of tonnes of ITO waste annually. Closed-loop “ITO target” recycling (crushed indium oxide sputter targets) is industrially practiced, recovering >95% of contained In.  
- **E-waste processing** – Printed circuit boards (PCBs) and old electronics can be smelted or leached. Indium usually ends up in the fine dust or solution fractions, so hydrometallurgical treatment (as above) extracts it. Modern e-waste facilities can capture a few percent of the metal by weight; indium recovery from mixed WEEE remains nascent.  
- **Effluent treatment** – Smelter and leaching effluents containing residual In (1–10 mg/L) can be purified by ion-exchange or precipitation (raising pH or sulfiding) to meet strict discharge limits (<0.1 mg/L). Captured indium in filters or sludge can be reprocessed.  
- **Slag reprocessing** – Old industrial slags with trace indium (10–50 ppm) can be roasted/leached. At current metal prices this is marginal, but research continues into efficient extractor reagents (e.g. deep-eutectic solvents, bioleaching).  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
Indium’s supply constraint is fundamentally geological: there are no large indium‐rich ore bodies, only trace concentrations in zinc–tin ores ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=It%20is%20generally%20considered%20that,and%20alloys%2C%20among%20others%2C%20are)).  Allied nations run only ~5–6 indium‐recovery facilities (Teck, Nyrstar, Korea Zinc, etc.), producing on the order of 100–200 t/yr combined, versus global demand approaching ~3,500 t/yr by 2030.  Building new indium capacity means installing multi-$100M zinc smelters with indium circuits (or dedicated indium extraction plants), which takes 10+ years, or greatly expanding electronics/ITO recycling infrastructure (currently largely absent outside Japan/Korea).  Absent those investments, the Western shortfall of ~1,000+ t/yr will persist, making imports (mostly from China) unavoidable through 2030 ([pulse.mk.co.kr](https://pulse.mk.co.kr/news/all/11252637#:~:text=The%20company%20operates%20the%20world%E2%80%99s,indium%20imports)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/11/1282#:~:text=It%20is%20generally%20considered%20that,and%20alloys%2C%20among%20others%2C%20are)).
