## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Refining/smelting infrastructure; roasting furnaces; reduction technology; vacuum distillation*  

The main technological bottleneck is **refining and smelting infrastructure**.  The U.S. and its allies have identified significant antimony ore resources (e.g., Idaho’s Stibnite deposit) but lack modern domestic plants to process antimony concentrates into metal.  For example, antimony processing currently relies on technologies (e.g. high-temperature fluidized roasters and carbon or iron reduction furnaces) that are predominantly located in China ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/#:~:text=China%20is%20set%20to%20implement,use)).  In August 2024, China announced export controls on antimony products and specifically barred the export of gold-antimony smelting technology ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/#:~:text=China%20is%20set%20to%20implement,use)), underscoring the strategic nature of these processes.  In practice, even if a new mine comes online, converting stibnite concentrate to saleable antimony metal requires roasting to Sb₂O₃ followed by carbothermic or iron-based reduction – equipment that few Western facilities have.  U.S. developers such as Perpetua Resources (Stibnite project) are already seeking foreign partners (e.g. Glencore, Trafigura) to install refining capacity after mining ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perpetua-resources-talks-with-glencore-others-us-antimony-processing-2025-09-26/#:~:text=mineral%20essential%20for%20producing%20bullets%2C,148%20million%20pounds%20of%20antimony)).  In short, the lack of integrated smelting/refining complexes outside China – and China’s tight control of that know-how – means that allied miners will likely have to ship concentrates abroad or build new high-temperature plants from scratch to obtain metal.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: 0 tons/year primary production across all allied nations*  

- **United States:** ~0 t (no active primary antimony mines).  The Stibnite Gold Project (Idaho) would be the first U.S. antimony mine; to date the U.S. has *no domestic production* and relies entirely on imports (and recycling) for antimony supply ([investor.wedbush.com](https://investor.wedbush.com/wedbush/article/newsdirect-2025-1-14-critical-metals-showdown-the-race-to-secure-domestic-antimony-supplies#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSecure%20sourcing%20of%20critical%20minerals,currently%20has%20no%20domestic%20production)). (The Biden administration is expediting permits for Stibnite given its strategic importance ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Perpetua%20Resources%20announced%20that%20the,applications%20and%20electric%20vehicle%20battery)).)  
- **Canada:** ~0 t.  Canada similarly has no dedicated antimony mine; any domestic output is only as a minor byproduct of base-metal production or from reclaimed lead-acid batteries.  Canada meets demand through imports.  (No official Canadian mine production reported.)  
- **Australia:** ~0 t.  Australia has no primary antimony mine.  Instead, Trafigura’s Nyrstar Port Pirie lead smelter (South Australia) is being modified to recover antimony (and bismuth) from imported lead concentrates.  In 2025 the Australian government pledged A$135 million to sustain the Port Pirie operations, which include studies to produce antimony byproduct ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/australia-pledges-87m-to-rescue-trafiguras-nyrstar-smelters-in-critical-minerals-push/#:~:text=Australia%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20that,critical%20minerals%20to%20Western%20allies)) ([www.businesstimes.com.sg](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/energy-commodities/australia-provide-135-million-bailout-trafigura-lead-zinc-smelters#:~:text=Under%20the%20funding%20package%2C%20Nyrstar,Australian%20government%20announced%20on%20Tuesday)).  (An antimony pilot plant has been fast-tracked at Port Pirie ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/australia-pledges-87m-to-rescue-trafiguras-nyrstar-smelters-in-critical-minerals-push/#:~:text=The%20support%20package%20will%20now,and%20bismuth%20in%20Port%20Pirie)), but dedicated output remains nascent.)  
- **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** ~0 t.  No active antimony mines exist in the EU, Norway or Iceland.  These economies rely entirely on imports of antimony metal or concentrate.  In 2023 the Netherlands – typically the largest EU importer – brought in about 3,012 tonnes of Chinese antimony; with China’s export controls beginning September 2024, imports to the EU have essentially ceased ([energynews.oedigital.com](https://energynews.oedigital.com/mining/2025/03/20/china-export-controls-have-frozen-antimony-shipments-into-the-eu-since-october#:~:text=The%20Netherlands%20was%20the%20largest,no%20shipments%20made%20since%20October)).  Thus domestic production is effectively zero.  
- **Japan:** ~0 t.  Japan has no antimony mining and meets its demand entirely through imports (primarily from Asia).  (No domestic output.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 40,000–60,000 tons/year total allied demand by 2030*  

- **Flame retardants:** Antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃) is the dominant antimony compound for flame retardancy (USGS reports it as the primary use of Sb₂O₃) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/antimony-statistics-and-information#:~:text=of%20antimony%20are%20found%20in,aircraft%20and%20automobile%20seat%20covers)), and account for roughly half of global antimony consumption.  Western markets (electronics, plastics, building materials) are expected to consume on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes annually by 2030 as fire-safety regulations tighten.  (For context, global antimony use in flame retardants is often cited at ~50%, implying Western demand in the 20–30 kt/yr range under current growth projections.)  
- **Lead-acid batteries:** Antimony is a key hardening additive in lead-acid battery grids ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/antimony-statistics-and-information#:~:text=of%20antimony%20are%20found%20in,aircraft%20and%20automobile%20seat%20covers)).  Despite a shift toward lithium-ion vehicles, stationary and backup lead-acid batteries remain significant.  Allied battery producers (e.g. Clarios (US), Hoppecke (Germany), GS Yuasa (Japan)) currently consume on the order of 10–15 kt Sb/yr, and some analysts project this could rise to ~15–20 kt/yr by 2030 under heavy EV/grid storage growth and continued legacy battery use.  (Ongoing shortages in antimony supply are already noted by the battery sector.)  
- **Photovoltaic glass (solar):** Antimony oxide is used in the manufacture of PV-quality glass.  The rapid build-out of solar panels globally is driving antimony demand in this sector.  Last year Argus Media reported that antimony demand for PV sodium antimonate exceeded 30,000 t/yr (2021–22) and could reach ~47,000 t by 2025 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/ja/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2403774-viewpoint-antimony-use-likely-in-new-technologies#:~:text=Demand%20for%20antimony%20for%20sodium,industry%2C%20according%20to%20market%20participants)).  Allied solar targets (e.g. ~400 GW US PV by 2030) imply antimony consumption in glass on the order of several thousand tonnes per year in the US+EU.  
- **Military/defense applications:** Antimony compounds are used in tracer bullets, primers, and specialty munitions, and in some military alloys.  U.S. defense planners have emphasized antimony as a critical material.  (The U.S. National Defense Stockpile already holds some antimony trisulfide, but officials have noted “no domestic production” and stress strategic stockpiling ([investor.wedbush.com](https://investor.wedbush.com/wedbush/article/newsdirect-2025-1-14-critical-metals-showdown-the-race-to-secure-domestic-antimony-supplies#:~:text=%E2%80%9CSecure%20sourcing%20of%20critical%20minerals,currently%20has%20no%20domestic%20production)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/#:~:text=China%2C%20the%20largest%20producer%20of,to%20the%20new%20export%20restrictions)).)  Allied government consumption is relatively modest today (a few thousand t/yr combined), but is considered critical; accelerated stockpiling could add thousands of tonnes to demand by 2030.  Press reports underscore tight supply in cooling chains and rising global prices for defense-use antimony ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/#:~:text=China%2C%20the%20largest%20producer%20of,to%20the%20new%20export%20restrictions)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 6,000–13,500 tons/year projected allied production by 2030*  

- **United States (planned):** On the order of 5,000–10,000 t/yr.  The Stibnite Gold Project would be the first U.S. antimony mine.  Its reserves are reported at ~148 million pounds of Sb (≈67,000 tonnes) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Perpetua%20Resources%20announced%20that%20the,applications%20and%20electric%20vehicle%20battery)); if mined at roughly 6–8 kt/yr this would supply a large fraction of U.S. needs.  Permitting (December 2024 ROD; conditional Notice-to-Proceed in 2025) puts first output in the late 2020s.  Even with Stibnite online, imports would still be needed.  Separately, the United States Antimony Corporation (USAC) in Montana is expanding its lone antimony smelter.  USAC plans to increase capacity from ~50 t/month to ~300–500 t/month (i.e. ~3,600–6,000 t/yr) by ~2025 ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/united-states-antimony-smelter-expansion-2025/#:~:text=The%20expansion%20project%20will%20increase,end%202025)), boosting domestic supply.  (USAC also has a U.S. Defense Logistics Agency contract for Sb metal supply ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perpetua-resources-talks-with-glencore-others-us-antimony-processing-2025-09-26/#:~:text=and%206%20million%20ounces%20of,million%20for%20antimony%20metal%20supply)).)  
- **Canada:** ~0–500 t/yr.  No large antimony mine is under development.  Any supply would come from byproduct streams (e.g. zinc, silver, or gold mines) or recycling – likely under 1,000 t/yr.  (Canada’s known Sb deposits are not yet proven for production.)  
- **Australia:** ~500–2,000 t/yr.  No primary antimony mines exist.  Production hinges on the Port Pirie byproduct project.  If Nyrstar/Trafigura successfully modifies Port Pirie to extract Sb (with A$135M support) there could be several hundred to a few thousand tons/year of Sb metal by the early 2030s ([www.businesstimes.com.sg](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/energy-commodities/australia-provide-135-million-bailout-trafigura-lead-zinc-smelters#:~:text=Under%20the%20funding%20package%2C%20Nyrstar,Australian%20government%20announced%20on%20Tuesday)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/australia-pledges-87m-to-rescue-trafiguras-nyrstar-smelters-in-critical-minerals-push/#:~:text=The%20support%20package%20will%20now,and%20bismuth%20in%20Port%20Pirie)).  Otherwise imports will remain necessary.  
- **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** ~0–1,000 t/yr.  No antimony mines currently operate.  Some research is identifying low-grade Sb veins (e.g. in Italy or Sweden), but none are ready to produce.  The EU is funding exploration and recovery projects (e.g. from recycled lead batteries) which could yield only a few hundred tonnes per year by 2030.  In practice, Western Europe will depend on imports.  
- **Japan:** ~0–500 t/yr.  Japan has no mined Sb.  Mitsubishi Materials and other firms process imported concentrates, but industrial output is minimal.  Japan will continue to import refined Sb or concentrate and may only supply small amounts (e.g. a few hundred t/yr) through adjustments in existing battery/refinery operations.

Record Sb prices (exceeding $20,000–30,000/ton) and stockpiling by Western buyers were triggered by China’s restrictions ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/#:~:text=China%2C%20the%20largest%20producer%20of,to%20the%20new%20export%20restrictions)) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/web/australia-pledges-87m-to-rescue-trafiguras-nyrstar-smelters-in-critical-minerals-push/#:~:text=Australia%20said%20on%20Tuesday%20that,critical%20minerals%20to%20Western%20allies)).

These, if successful, would provide the first significant non-Chinese Sb outputs for the U.S. and allies.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Geochemical mapping; IP/resistivity surveys; hyperspectral imaging; stream sediment analysis*  

Explorers combine classic field geology with modern remote and geophysical methods to locate Sb deposits.  Geochemical surveys (soil, stream-sediment, rock-chip sampling) are essential for detecting antimony anomalies; stibnite veins often carry pathfinders (As, Tl, Au) that help vector exploration.  Induced-polarization (IP) and resistivity surveys are particularly effective for sulfide targets: massive sulfide mineralization (e.g. stibnite-rich veins) produces strong chargeability highs and low resistivity zones ([www.scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=104088#:~:text=massive%20sulfides%20deposits%20are%20indicated,Ja%2C%20Oo%2C%20%26%20Arce%2C%202014)).  Airborne magnetics/radiometrics can map alteration zones and structures hosting Sb.  Satellite and airborne hyperspectral/multispectral imagery allow detection of hydrothermal alteration minerals (e.g. kaolinite, sericite, carbonates) over wide areas ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1366727/full#:~:text=Remote%20sensing%20technology%20is%20characterized,can%20be%20acquired%20at%20multiple)), which can highlight buried antimony mineralization.  High-resolution LiDAR and drone photogrammetry help trace vein exposures in rugged terrain.  New AI and data-integration tools (GIS/gridded geochemistry combined with structural models) are being tested to “smartly” target antimony systems, following successful methods applied in base-metal exploration.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Underground mining; flotation concentration; gravity separation; roasting*  

- **Mining Methods:**  Stibnite-type Sb deposits are typically mined via underground or open-pit methods, depending on depth and geometry.  For example, the Stibnite orebody would likely use both open-pit (for supergene zones) and cut-and-fill underground (for high-grade veins).  Standard underground methods (declines, stoping) are applied where Sb-bearing quartz-carbonate veins occur.  
- **Ore Preconcentration:**  Ore is crushed and ground, then concentrated by gravity and flotation.  Stibnite (Sb₂S₃) has a high specific gravity (~4.6) and is amenable to gravity separation (e.g. jigs or spirals) for coarse pre-concentration.  Flotation using xanthate (or similar) collectors is widely used to produce an antimony concentrate (typically 30–50% Sb) ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/antimony-ore-processed-flotation#:~:text=The%20problem%20discussed%20in%20this,of%20the%20final%20antimony%20concentrate)).  (For example, a concentrator design on stibnite involved grinding to fine size then flotation to recover stibnite from quartz+talc gangue ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/antimony-ore-processed-flotation#:~:text=The%20problem%20discussed%20in%20this,of%20the%20final%20antimony%20concentrate)).)  Modern plants may employ staged gravity prior to flotation to improve recovery.  
- **Roasting:**  The principal extraction step for Sb is oxidative roasting of concentrate to antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃).  In a fluidized-bed or rotary kiln roaster, Sb₂S₃ + O₂ is converted to Sb₂O₃ (gas) plus SO₂.  The volatile Sb₂O₃ is collected downstream with >95% recovery ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=roasting%20of%20stibnite%20,1000%20%C2%B0C%20%5B4)).  This roasting step drives off sulfur (as SO₂, which is scrubbed) and yields Sb₂O₃ suitable for sale (flame-retardant grade) or further reduction.  Temperature and residence time are controlled to optimize Sb recovery while avoiding sintering.  
- **Hydrometallurgical (autoclave) options:**  In some newer projects, pressure leaching of concentrate is being evaluated.  For example, autoclave sulfuric-acid and chloride leaching can dissolve Sb (co-dissolving any Au present in “stibnite” ores) allowing separation in solution.  This route can be attractive for low-grade or high-arsenic concentrates.  However, all major current Sb projects still rely on pyrometallurgy for bulk recovery.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Oxidative roasting; carbothermic reduction; “fire refining”; vacuum distillation*  

- **Oxidative Roasting:**  As above, Sb₂S₃ concentrate is oxidized to Sb₂O₃ in a controlled-roast step (550–650°C).  The roasted product (Sb₂O₃ powder) is the usual intermediate.  This roasting vaporizes antimony as trioxide (as mostly Sb₄O₆) and leaves oxidic residues.  Typical roast processes achieve >95% Sb conversion ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=roasting%20of%20stibnite%20,1000%20%C2%B0C%20%5B4)).  Impurities like arsenic oxide may volatilize more easily, aiding downstream removal.  
- **Carbothermic Reduction:**  Sb₂O₃ is then reduced to metal in a furnace.  Conventional methods include reverberatory or blast furnaces where carbon (coke or charcoal) or iron serves as reductant.  For example, Sb₂O₃ + 3C → 2Sb + 3CO.  The most common modern technique is a blast-furnace smelt: Sb₂O₃ and charcoal (often with flux like silica) are charged to a reverberatory/regenerator furnace, yielding metallic antimony (60–90% Sb alloy) and slag.  The blast-furnace approach is “adaptable to different feeds” and gives very high recovery (≈95–98%) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=been%20practiced%20for%20the%20treatment,scales.%20For)).  (China’s Xikuangshan smelters use counter-current flash-roasting kilns feeding reverberatory furnaces to produce >6,000 t/yr each.)  
- **Fire refining / slag treatment:**  The crude antimony metal is further refined by re-melting and oxidation/slagging steps.  For example, iron or soda-lime flux can refine out lead and precious metals, leaving antimony-rich alloy.  Slag from lead smelting (e.g. from Pb-Sb bullions) is re-smelted to recover residual Sb, typically adding carbon (and sometimes Fe) to reduce SbO_x.  
- **Vacuum Distillation:**  High-purity Sb (≥99.95%) is usually obtained by vacuum distillation of metallic antimony.  In a series of vacuum retorts, molten Sb is evaporated at ~900–1000°C under low pressure (<0.1 Torr).  Due to Sb’s high vapor pressure, most impurities (Bi, Pb, As, etc.) remain in the residue.  Pioneered by Chinese refiners, vacuum distillation can produce ultrahigh-purity Sb (antimony with 99.99% purity has been reported after vacuum refining) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=Vacuum%20distillation%20was%2C%20therefore%2C%20successfully,purity%20%5B86%5D.%20By)).  
- **Electrolytic Refining (niche):**  A few plants use electrolysis to purify Sb.  Impure Sb anodes are dissolved in chloride or fluoride melts and high-purity Sb is plated out at the cathode, similar to copper refining.  This removes trace metals but is energy-intensive and not common globally.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Pressure leaching; zone refining; vacuum distillation; electrolytic purification*  

- **Hydrometallurgical Refining:**  Research has explored dissolving roasted or crude Sb in hot acid or chloride solution to separate it from other metals (e.g. gold).  For instance, pressure leaching in chloride media can extract Sb from calcine, then precipitate Sb by pH control ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=processes.%20More%20recently%2C%20bio,grade%20ores%20%28%3C5%25%20Sb)).  Such methods (e.g. FeCl₃ leaching of Sb₂O₃) have been demonstrated at pilot scale, but have not replaced pyrometallurgy for primary refining.  
- **Zone Refining:**  For ultra-high-purity Sb (specialty electronics grade), multiple passes of zone melting can be applied.  An ingot of crude Sb is passed slowly through a heated zone; more-volatile impurities remain in the melt zone and move along the bar, increasing purity.  Zone refining can reach impurity levels of only parts per million, suitable for semiconductor materials.  
- **Vacuum Distillation (purifying metal):**  As above, vacuum distillation is also a final purification step.  By distilling metallic antimony under vacuum (often in two stages to separate Cu/Fe from Pb), refineries can achieve >99.90% Sb with very low arsenic/lead ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=Vacuum%20distillation%20was%2C%20therefore%2C%20successfully,purity%20%5B86%5D.%20By)).  For example, Al additions are sometimes used to remove arsenic during vacuum refine ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=Vacuum%20distillation%20was%2C%20therefore%2C%20successfully,purity%20%5B86%5D.%20By)).  
- **Electrolytic Purification:**  Some facilities use electrolysis (SbCl₃ electrolyte) to achieve battery grade Sb.  This method selectively deposits Sb metal and leaves impurities as anode sludge.  It is relatively rare due to complexity, but can produce uniformly high-purity Sb suitable for sensitive alloys.  
- **Slag/Secondary Processing:**  All refining plants generate slags or residues.  These often still contain 5–10% Sb.  Additional charcoal reduction of slags or acid leaching of residues can recover this Sb.  Such secondary recovery is standard industry practice (e.g. treating lead-acid battery recycling slags) and can boost overall Sb yield.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: Lime neutralization; constructed wetlands; iron-based adsorbents; phytostabilization*  

- **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Treatment:**  Sb and associated As in mine drainage are managed by pH control.  Alkaline reagents (e.g. lime/Ca(OH)₂) are added to AMD to raise pH to ~8–10, precipitating Fe and Sb as hydroxides/oxyhydroxides ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/8/1590#:~:text=processes.%20More%20recently%2C%20bio,grade%20ores%20%28%3C5%25%20Sb)).  The resulting sludge (iron-rich precipitates) strongly adsorbs Sb and As, which are removed by settlement or filtration.  Bench- and pilot-scale work shows Sb can be removed to ppb levels by this lime treatment.  
- **Constructed Wetlands/Bioreactors:**  Engineered wetlands combining plants, organic substrates and microbial processes are used for low-volume Sb-contaminated waters.  Iron-oxidizing bacteria can enhance Fe(III) precipitates (e.g. ferrihydrite) that co-precipitate Sb.  For example, wetlands with Fe(II)-fed bioreactors create iron oxides in situ that trap Sb; these passive systems have been successfully trialed at Sb and As mine sites.  
- **Adsorption Media:**  Granular adsorbents (e.g. granular ferric hydroxide, iron-coated sands, biochars) are used in water treatment filters to polish Sb.  Laboratory studies and pilot projects demonstrate that ferric-based adsorbents can bind both Sb(III) and Sb(V) efficiently, removals often >90% at pH 5–8 ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/10/794#:~:text=match%20at%20L177%20initial%20concentration%2C,theoretical%20and%20technical%20support%20for)).  In practice, water treatment trains often include adsorption columns to lower dissolved Sb to <10 ppb.  
- **Erosion Control and Phytostabilization:**  Sb-bearing tailings and dumps are capped and vegetated to prevent erosion.  Metal-tolerant plants (e.g. certain grasses, willows, poplars) are used for phytostabilization: these species limit Sb mobility by root uptake and soil cover, without accumulating it in biomass.  Such measures help contain residual Sb in mine waste.

Permitting of the Stibnite project confirms the ore is typical stibnite requiring roasting to oxide and reduction to metal ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Perpetua%20Resources%20announced%20that%20the,applications%20and%20electric%20vehicle%20battery)).  
• **Concentrate production:** Known Sb ore grades (often 1–2% Sb) indicate milling yields ~30–50% Sb concentrates.  Experimental recoveries in stibnite flotation (e.g. 150 tpd mills) achieve concentrates with ~30–40% Sb ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/antimony-ore-processed-flotation#:~:text=The%20problem%20discussed%20in%20this,of%20the%20final%20antimony%20concentrate)).  Recent market reports of record Sb oxide prices (due to solar/battery demand) are motivating fresh exploration and even recycling of obsolete Sb materials.

These efforts reflect recognition that Western mining alone is insufficient without new processing.  The reviewed metallurgical literature validates that roasting, reduction, and distillation are the necessary steps once concentrates are shipped to refining.  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
Allied Sb production is constrained by **downstream processing capacity**.  No Western country currently has an integrated antimony processing complex like China’s.  Chinese dominance (controlling ~90% of the Sb supply chain ([www.engineeringnews.co.za](https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/perpetua-promotes-stibnite-project-amid-china-antimony-export-ban-2024-08-15#:~:text=supply%20currently%20exists.%C2%A0China%2C%C2%A0Russia%C2%A0and%C2%A0Tajikistan%20control%2090,the%20global%20antimony%20supply%20chain))) and export controls on technology mean U.S. and allied miners cannot easily access core know-how.  Thus, even with new mines (Idaho, etc.), the lack of domestic refining facilities (roasters, reduction furnaces, distillation units) means raw stibnite ore would likely have to be shipped abroad for refining – unless major investments or joint ventures are made to build such plants in the West.
