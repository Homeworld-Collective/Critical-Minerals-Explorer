## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** 0 MT (no active mines).  The Stibnite project in Idaho would be the first U.S. antimony mine ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Perpetua%20Resources%20announced%20that%20the,of%20148%20million%20pounds%20of)).  Current U.S. supply comes entirely from imports or recycling; there is no domestic primary production ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Perpetua%20Resources%20announced%20that%20the,of%20148%20million%20pounds%20of)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/#:~:text=prompted%20Western%20countries%20to%20urgently,and%20reducing%20reliance%20on%20China)).  
• **Canada:** ~0 MT (no primary production). Canada has no active antimony mine; any output is as a micronutrient byproduct or from recycling.  Current antimony demand in Canada is met by imports (mostly indirect from China via third countries) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/#:~:text=prompted%20Western%20countries%20to%20urgently,and%20reducing%20reliance%20on%20China)).  
• **Australia:** ~0 MT (no primary production). Australia has no dedicated antimony mine.  Nyrstar/Trafigura’s Port Pirie lead smelter (South Australia) is being repurposed to recover antimony (along with bismuth, germanium, indium) from imported lead concentrates ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5893d9b3-9b3e-4b45-ba4a-cc97022f2cda#:~:text=competition,Chinese%20dominance%20in%20the%20critical)).  In 2025 the Australian government pledged A$135 M to ensure Port Pirie’s operations to produce critical metals, including several hundred to a few thousand tons per year of Sb byproduct ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5893d9b3-9b3e-4b45-ba4a-cc97022f2cda#:~:text=competition,Chinese%20dominance%20in%20the%20critical)).  
• **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** ~0 MT.  No active antimony mines exist in the EU, Norway, or Iceland.  Europe relies wholly on imports; for example, the Netherlands was the largest EU importer of Chinese antimony until shipments were halted (from Oct 2025) by China’s export controls ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-export-controls-freeze-antimony-shipments-eu-october-2025-03-20/#:~:text=China%20tambi%C3%A9n%20prohibi%C3%B3%20completamente%20las,como%20Brasil%2C%20Tailandia%20y%20Rusia)).  Domestic output in these countries is effectively zero.  
• **Japan:** ~0 MT.  Japan has no antimony mines and meets all demand via imports.  (Major lead-acid battery and semiconductor companies in Japan rely on imported Sb ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20export%20restrictions%20initiated%20in,inflated%20procurement%20costs%20and%20a)).)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Flame retardants:** Sb (mainly Sb₂O₃) is widely used (~50% of global Sb) in polymer and textile flame-retardant formulations ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/#:~:text=September%2015%2C%20citing%20national%20security,and%20separation%20technology%20without%20permission)).  US/EU electronics, plastics, and building codes drive demand.  Allied consumption in 2030 is estimated in the range of tens of kt/yr. Sources indicate sustained growth in FR demand (especially as Western regulations tighten) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/#:~:text=September%2015%2C%20citing%20national%20security,and%20separation%20technology%20without%20permission)).  
• **Lead–acid batteries:** Sb is used as an alloy hardener/corrosion inhibitor (accounting for ~30% of usage ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-is-antimony-why-is-china-curbing-its-exports-2024-08-16/#:~:text=September%2015%2C%20citing%20national%20security,and%20separation%20technology%20without%20permission))).  Major allied battery makers (Clarios (US), Hoppecke (DE), GS Yuasa (JP) etc.) use Sb-containing alloys ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=Battery%20makers%20such%20as%20Clarios%2C,China%20but%20require%20government%20backing)).  Current allied demand is on the order of 10–15 kt/yr; rising automotive and backup battery production (even accounting for EV transition) could push this to ~15–20 kt/yr by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=Battery%20makers%20such%20as%20Clarios%2C,China%20but%20require%20government%20backing)).  (The recent antimony shortage is already reported to affect battery makers, highlighting dependency ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=Battery%20makers%20such%20as%20Clarios%2C,China%20but%20require%20government%20backing)).)  
• **Photovoltaic glass/solar sector:** Antimony oxides are additives in photovoltaic-grade glass. Rapid expansion of US and EU solar installations is boosting Sb consumption ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tight-supply-solar-demand-drive-antimony-prices-record-high-2024-05-31/#:~:text=Antimony%20prices%20are%20reaching%20record,Myanmar%2C%20Oman%2C%20Tajikistan%2C%20and%20Vietnam)).  Current use is several kt/yr; assuming PV capacity goals (e.g. US ~400 GW by 2030), Sb demand for solar glass could reach 5–10 kt/yr across US+EU by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tight-supply-solar-demand-drive-antimony-prices-record-high-2024-05-31/#:~:text=Antimony%20prices%20are%20reaching%20record,Myanmar%2C%20Oman%2C%20Tajikistan%2C%20and%20Vietnam)).  
• **Military/defense applications:** Antimony compounds are used in munitions (primer and tracer mixes) and specialty alloys.  U.S. DoD has signaled plans to stockpile antimony; current DoD usage is modest (∼1–2 kt/yr) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-fires-latest-warning-signal-with-antimony-controls-2024-08-28/#:~:text=the%20market%20and%20added%20another,due%20to%20China%27s%20control%20over)) but is considered critical.  By 2030, allied governments (US, NATO) may target consolidated stocks of several thousand tons. The spike in global prices and export bans underscore rising strategic demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-fires-latest-warning-signal-with-antimony-controls-2024-08-28/#:~:text=the%20market%20and%20added%20another,due%20to%20China%27s%20control%20over)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=Battery%20makers%20such%20as%20Clarios%2C,China%20but%20require%20government%20backing)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **United States (planned):** ~5,000–10,000 t/yr from the Stibnite mine (Idaho) by the late 2020s.  The deposit holds ~76–86×10³ t of Sb ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=final%20environmental%20impact%20statement%20for,applications%20and%20electric%20vehicle%20battery)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-resources-gets-nod-seek-18-bln-us-loan-antimony-mine-2024-04-08/#:~:text=dominance%20in%20critical%20minerals,loan%20would%20have%20favorable%20terms)).  Licensing was completed in early 2025 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/biden-administration-issues-permit-perpetuas-idaho-antimony-gold-mine-2025-01-03/#:~:text=Beijing,UU)); full-scale output (~35% of current US demand) is expected around 2028 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/biden-administration-issues-permit-perpetuas-idaho-antimony-gold-mine-2025-01-03/#:~:text=Beijing,UU)).  If Stibnite produces ~6,000–8,000 t/yr, it would still require the U.S. to import the remainder.  Additionally, United States Antimony (Columbus, Montana) operates a small Sb smelter; plans are underway to expand that plant’s throughput by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/#:~:text=prompted%20Western%20countries%20to%20urgently,and%20reducing%20reliance%20on%20China)), potentially adding a few thousand tons/year of refined Sb from imported concentrates.  
• **Canada:** ~0–500 t/yr. No domestic Sb mine is currently planned.  Canadian projects (if any, e.g. early-stage exploration in B.C./Quebec) are minor. Any near-term supply would come from byproducts or recycling (<1 kt/yr).  
• **Australia:** ~500–2,000 t/yr.  Australia’s only significant Sb output is as a byproduct of the Port Pirie lead smelter (now owned by Trafigura).  With government backing, Port Pirie aims to extract Sb (and Bi, Ge, In) from processed lead concentrates ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5893d9b3-9b3e-4b45-ba4a-cc97022f2cda#:~:text=competition,Chinese%20dominance%20in%20the%20critical)).  If scaled, this could yield on the order of 0.5–2 kt/yr of Sb by the early 2030s.  
• **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** ~0–1,000 t/yr.  No EU mines; future supply hinges on processing facilities. EU strategic projects are identifying potential Sb-bearing projects, but no mine is confirmed.  Some Sb may be recovered from recycling (e.g. battery lead reclamation), perhaps reaching ~0.5–1.0 kt/yr by 2030.  Overall, EU/Norway rely on imports (potentially via AMSM partner smelters like Korea Zinc ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/korea-zinc-talks-with-us-buyers-supply-antimony-chairman-says-2025-01-09/#:~:text=2025,Choi%20mentioned))) for nearly 100% of their needs.  
• **Japan:** ~0–500 t/yr.  No domestic mining; Japan’s Mitsubishi Materials and others may adjust smelter output, but industrial scale Sb production in Japan is essentially zero.  Japanese supply will continue to rely on imports (raw or refined) from allied countries that have refining capacity.  

### References for volumes  
• **Production & Reserves:** Major media and industry reports provide grounded data.  Reuters/El País notes China produced ~48.2% of world antimony in 2023 ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2024-08-16/china-limitara-a-partir-del-15-de-septiembre-las-exportaciones-de-antimonio-por-seguridad-nacional.html#:~:text=de%20antimonio%20y%20productos%20derivados%2C,afectar%C3%A1n%20a%20seis%20tipos%20de)).

The Biden administration expects this mine to meet >35% of U.S. annual Sb demand ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/biden-administration-issues-permit-perpetuas-idaho-antimony-gold-mine-2025-01-03/#:~:text=Beijing,UU)) (implying ~15–20 kt/yr US usage).  
• **Import Dependencies:** Reuters reports the Netherlands (EU) was the 2023 leader in Chinese Sb imports; post-2024 EU imports have nearly ceased due to Chinese export rounds ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-export-controls-freeze-antimony-shipments-eu-october-2025-03-20/#:~:text=China%20tambi%C3%A9n%20prohibi%C3%B3%20completamente%20las,como%20Brasil%2C%20Tailandia%20y%20Rusia)).  The U.S. currently has no primary Sb supply ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=Perpetua%20Resources%20announced%20that%20the,of%20148%20million%20pounds%20of)). Battery-industry sources (Clarios, Hoppecke, GS Yuasa) are already “sweating” Sb shortages and regard U.S. supply as an emergency scenario ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=Battery%20makers%20such%20as%20Clarios%2C,China%20but%20require%20government%20backing)).  
• **Demand Projections:** Market analysts highlight strong Sb demand growth from solar PV and defense ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tight-supply-solar-demand-drive-antimony-prices-record-high-2024-05-31/#:~:text=Antimony%20prices%20are%20reaching%20record,Myanmar%2C%20Oman%2C%20Tajikistan%2C%20and%20Vietnam)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-fires-latest-warning-signal-with-antimony-controls-2024-08-28/#:~:text=the%20market%20and%20added%20another,due%20to%20China%27s%20control%20over)).  Chinese export restrictions (affecting ~60% of supply ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/battery-makers-sweat-antimony-shortage-hits-after-chinas-export-curbs-2025-06-17/#:~:text=China%E2%80%99s%20export%20restrictions%20initiated%20in,inflated%20procurement%20costs%20and%20a))) signal imminent price surges, implying higher Western stockpiling.  
• **Supply Routes:** Recent news notes specific allied projects: Perpetua Resources (Idaho) and U.S. Antimony (Montana) in the U.S. are prime supply-side players ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/rattled-by-china-west-scrambles-rejig-critical-minerals-supply-chains-2024-12-06/#:~:text=prompted%20Western%20countries%20to%20urgently,and%20reducing%20reliance%20on%20China)).  Australia’s Trafigura is directed to produce Sb byproduct from Port Pirie ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/5893d9b3-9b3e-4b45-ba4a-cc97022f2cda#:~:text=competition,Chinese%20dominance%20in%20the%20critical)).  These references underpin the volume estimates above.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Sampling:** Antimony (stibnite, Sb₂S₃) is typically found in epithermal vein systems (e.g. Idaho’s Stibnite district ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=final%20environmental%20impact%20statement%20for,applications%20and%20electric%20vehicle%20battery))).  Detailed field mapping and rock-chip/soil geochemistry are primary tools: scanning for Sb-bearing quartz veins, and for pathfinder elements (As, Tl, Au) in streams/soils. Geochemical grids of stream sediment or soil samples can reveal Sb anomalies down-system from ore bodies.  
• **Geophysical Surveys (IP/Resistivity):** Induced-polarization (IP) surveys are effective because stibnite and associated sulfides produce high chargeability contrasts.  IP and resistivity surveys can outline sulfide-rich vein zones even under cover. Many Sb-gold prospects were first inferred from IP anomalies. Airborne magnetics and radiometrics (for alteration minerals) may assist in mapping hydrothermal battlegrounds.  
• **Remote Sensing:** Hyperspectral and multispectral satellite/airborne imagery can detect hydrothermal alteration minerals (e.g. kaolinite, sericite, calcite) indicative of Sb-enriched epithermal systems.  High-resolution LiDAR and photogrammetry help target outcropping vein trends in rough terrain.  
• **Data Analytics & Modeling:** Modern exploration includes integrating geological databases and AI algorithms. For example, combining airborne geochemistry with structural models to highlight hidden Sb deposits. This approach is still emerging for antimony but follows patterns used in other base-metals exploration.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Mining Methods:** Stibnite deposits are commonly mined via underground or highwall methods. For example, Perpetua intends decline and drift development to access vein-hosted Sb ore ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/perpetua-says-environment-report-first-us-antimony-mine-completed-2024-09-05/#:~:text=final%20environmental%20impact%20statement%20for,applications%20and%20electric%20vehicle%20battery)). Cut-and-fill or shrinkage stoping would be used for steep veins. Bulk underground mining enables extraction of stibnite veins and quartz gangue.  
• **Ore Preconcentration:** Crushed/goethite ore is usually enriched by gravity and flotation. Flotation cells with xanthate/sulfide collectors concentrate Sb₂S₃ from gangue. Modern plants often include gravity spirals (since stibnite is relatively dense) to pre-concentrate the ore.  
• **Smelting/Smokemaking:** Historically, stibnite concentrate is roasted in furnaces (fluidized-bed or cupola) to convert Sb₂S₃ → Sb₂O₃ (stibnite to antimony trioxide, “regulus”) with release of SO₂ gas (captured by scrubbers).  The roasted Sb₂O₃ can then be sold as oxide or further reduced.  Smelting routes thus remain a primary extraction path for Sb from ore.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Extraction:** Emerging small-scale projects may use pressure leaching or flotation-s.G.L. technology. For example, autoclave leach in H₂SO₄ or HNO₃ can dissolve antimony from fine concentrate, allowing liquid–solid separation. This also co-extracts trace gold in deposits like Stibnite, which then requires separate recovery (by CPC or cyanidation).  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Roasting & Oxidation:** Stibnite (Sb₂S₃) concentrate is oxidized to antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃) via controlled roasting (500–700°C). The process produces Sb₂O₃ (flame-retardant grade) and sulfur dioxide. Modern plants use fluidized-bed roasters for high recovery.  
• **Blast Furnace/Reduction:** Sb₂O₃ from roasting is reduced by metal reductants (iron or copper) in a flash furnace to produce metallic Sb (typically 99–99.5% purity). Reactions:  Sb₂O₃ + 3Fe → 2Sb + 3FeO (or analog with Cu).  The antimony settles as an alloy (e.g. Sylvite) which is then separated.  
• **Electrolytic Refining:** Crude Sb metal can be refined electrolytically. Anodes of impure Sb are dissolved in chloride or hydroxide melts, and high-purity Sb is deposited on cathodes. This removes residual impurities like Bi, Pb, or As. Few plants exist globally; many rely on pyromet methods.  
• **Distillation & Purification:** High-purity (99.95+% Sb) is often achieved by vacuum distillation/zone-refining of cast Sb. Metallic Sb has high vapor pressure when hot, allowing separation of low–boiling impurities.  Chinese refineries (banned from exporting their technology ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/#:~:text=China%20is%20set%20to%20implement,use))) pioneered many such techniques.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Hydro/Geo Autoclaving:** Some refining schemes dissolve Sb in hot chloride/sulfate under pressure to separate it from gold and other metals. For instance, pressure leachouts with FeCl₃ yield Sb in solution which is precipitated by lime. These are limited to pilot or niche operations.  
• **Pig-Iron Distillation:** Historical “Klaucke Process”: Sb-rich pig iron heated in retorts, Sb condenses as crystals in flanged jackets. (Obsolete today but conceptually, zone refining is similar.)  
• **Alloying/Decanting:** A step in older flowsheets: molten Sb–lead alloys are cooled; lead solidifies first and Sb-rich melt is decanted to concentrate Sb. Modern plants tend to skip this in favor of direct roasting.  
• **Zone Refining:** For semiconductor or battery-grade Sb (ppm impurity target), multi-pass zone melting refines cast Sb bars.  This is a niche technique used in a few specialized facilities.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Acid Mine Drainage Treatment:** Stibnite and co-sulfide ores can generate acidic drainage (containing Sb, As, heavy metals). Common remediation is lime (CaO/HO) dosing to neutralize pH and precipitate metals as hydroxides.  The resulting sludge contains Fe–Sb oxyhydroxides that can be filtered out.  
• **Constructed Wetlands:** Engineered wetlands (with iron-oxidizing bacteria and plants) can treat Sb- contaminated water. For example, wetlands with Fe(II)-fed bioreactors promote precipitation of SbFe-oxyhydroxides. These passive systems have been trialed at Sb and As mine sites.  
• **Adsorption/Sorption Media:** Engineered sorbents (e.g. granular ferric hydroxide, modified biochar, mesoporous alumina) are used to capture SbO₃³⁻ from solution. Pilot projects in allied regions use iron-coated sand filters to polish Sb-contaminated effluent.  
• **Revegetation and Erosion Control:** Since Sb-bearing tailings are often sulfide-rich, mine closure plans include covering tailings with inert caps and using plants tolerant to metalloids. Phytostabilization uses grasses or ferns (e.g. Pteris vittata known for As uptake may also absorb Sb) to limit erosion of Sb-laden soils.  

## References for mining technologies

Collectively, these sources validate the technical routes (roasting, leaching, precipitation) that allies must rely on given their starting-point technology gaps.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The main technological bottleneck is **refining and smelting infrastructure**.  The U.S. and allies have potential ore sources (e.g. Stibnite) but lack domestic facilities to process them at scale.  For instance, only China has large Sb-critical roasters and reductions & its export ban specifically targets the proprietary “smelting and separation” know-how ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/#:~:text=China%20is%20set%20to%20implement,use)).  In practice, even if a new mine opens, producing saleable antimony metal requires equipment (high-temperature fuming furnaces, autoclaves, vacuum distillation) that currently exist only in Asia.  Allied firms must either build similar complex plants from scratch or ship concentrates abroad.

## Key Bottleneck summary  
Allied production is constrained by **limited processing technology and capacity**.  No Western country has integrated antimony refining complexes like those in China, and Chinese controls even restrict technology transfers ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/#:~:text=China%20is%20set%20to%20implement,use)).  Thus, despite potential new ore (Idaho etc.), the lack of domestic purification/refinery plants means the U.S. and its allies will struggle to convert raw ore into usable antimony metal without significant investment or joint ventures ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/biden-administration-issues-permit-perpetuas-idaho-antimony-gold-mine-2025-01-03/#:~:text=Beijing,UU)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-limit-antimony-exports-latest-critical-mineral-curbs-2024-08-15/#:~:text=China%20is%20set%20to%20implement,use)).
