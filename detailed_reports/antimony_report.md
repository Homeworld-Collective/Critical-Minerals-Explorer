## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Refining/smelting infrastructure; roasting furnaces; reduction technology; vacuum distillation*

The main technological bottleneck is **refining and smelting infrastructure**. The U.S. and allies have potential ore sources (e.g., Stibnite) but lack domestic facilities to process them at scale. For instance, only China has large-scale antimony roasters and reduction facilities, and its export ban specifically targets proprietary "smelting and separation" know-how. In practice, even if a new mine opens, producing saleable antimony metal requires equipment (high-temperature roasting furnaces, autoclaves, vacuum distillation) that currently exists primarily in Asia. Allied firms must either build similar complex plants from scratch or ship concentrates abroad for processing.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: 0 tons/year primary production across all allied nations*

• **United States:** 0 MT (no active mines). The Stibnite project in Idaho would be the first U.S. antimony mine. Current U.S. supply comes entirely from imports or recycling; there is no domestic primary production.

• **Canada:** ~0 MT (no primary production). Canada has no active antimony mine; any output is as a minor byproduct or from recycling. Current antimony demand in Canada is met by imports (mostly indirect from China via third countries).

• **Australia:** ~0 MT (no primary production). Australia has no dedicated antimony mine. Nyrstar/Trafigura's Port Pirie lead smelter (South Australia) is being repurposed to recover antimony (along with bismuth, germanium, indium) from imported lead concentrates. In 2024, the Australian government pledged A$135 million to ensure Port Pirie's operations to produce critical metals, including antimony as a byproduct.

• **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** ~0 MT. No active antimony mines exist in the EU, Norway, or Iceland. Europe relies wholly on imports; for example, the Netherlands was a major EU importer of Chinese antimony until shipments were restricted by China's export controls implemented in September 2024. Domestic output in these countries is effectively zero.

• **Japan:** ~0 MT. Japan has no antimony mines and meets all demand via imports. Major lead-acid battery and semiconductor companies in Japan rely on imported antimony.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 40,000-60,000 tons/year total allied demand by 2030*

• **Flame retardants:** Antimony (mainly Sb₂O₃) is widely used (~50% of global antimony consumption) in polymer and textile flame-retardant formulations. US/EU electronics, plastics, and building codes drive demand. Allied consumption in 2030 is estimated at 20,000-30,000 tons/year. Sources indicate sustained growth in flame retardant demand, especially as Western fire safety regulations tighten.

• **Lead-acid batteries:** Antimony is used as an alloy hardener/corrosion inhibitor (accounting for ~30% of global usage). Major allied battery makers (Clarios (US), Hoppecke (Germany), GS Yuasa (Japan)) use antimony-containing alloys. Current allied demand is approximately 10,000-15,000 tons/year; rising automotive and backup battery production (even accounting for EV transition) could push this to 15,000-20,000 tons/year by 2030. Recent antimony shortages are already affecting battery makers, highlighting dependency.

• **Photovoltaic glass/solar sector:** Antimony oxides are additives in photovoltaic-grade glass. Rapid expansion of US and EU solar installations is boosting antimony consumption. Current use is several thousand tons/year; assuming PV capacity goals (e.g., US ~400 GW by 2030), antimony demand for solar glass could reach 5,000-10,000 tons/year across US+EU by 2030.

• **Military/defense applications:** Antimony compounds are used in munitions (primer and tracer mixes) and specialty alloys. U.S. DoD has signaled plans to stockpile antimony; current DoD usage is modest (~1,000-2,000 tons/year) but is considered critical. By 2030, allied governments (US, NATO) may target consolidated stocks of several thousand tons. The spike in global prices and export bans underscore rising strategic demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 6,000-13,500 tons/year projected allied production by 2030*

• **United States (planned):** ~5,000-10,000 tons/year from the Stibnite mine (Idaho) by the late 2020s. The deposit holds approximately 67,000 tons of antimony reserves. The Biden administration issued the final permit in January 2025; full-scale output is expected around 2028-2029. If Stibnite produces ~6,000-8,000 tons/year, it would meet approximately 35% of current US demand, still requiring imports for the remainder. Additionally, United States Antimony Corporation (Montana) operates a small antimony smelter; plans are underway to expand that plant's throughput by 2030, potentially adding 1,000-2,000 tons/year of refined antimony from imported concentrates.

• **Canada:** ~0-500 tons/year. No domestic antimony mine is currently planned. Canadian projects (if any, e.g., early-stage exploration in British Columbia/Quebec) are minor. Any near-term supply would come from byproducts or recycling (<1,000 tons/year).

• **Australia:** ~500-2,000 tons/year. Australia's only significant antimony output is as a byproduct of the Port Pirie lead smelter (now owned by Trafigura). With government backing, Port Pirie aims to extract antimony (and bismuth, germanium, indium) from processed lead concentrates. If scaled, this could yield 500-2,000 tons/year of antimony by the early 2030s.

• **European Union/Norway/Iceland:** ~0-1,000 tons/year. No EU mines; future supply hinges on processing facilities. EU strategic projects are identifying potential antimony-bearing deposits, but no mine is confirmed. Some antimony may be recovered from recycling (e.g., battery lead reclamation), perhaps reaching ~500-1,000 tons/year by 2030. Overall, EU/Norway rely on imports for nearly 100% of their needs.

• **Japan:** ~0-500 tons/year. No domestic mining; Japan's Mitsubishi Materials and others may adjust smelter output, but industrial-scale antimony production in Japan is essentially zero. Japanese supply will continue to rely on imports (raw or refined) from allied countries that have refining capacity.

### References for volumes
• **Production & Reserves:** China produced approximately 60% of world antimony in 2023, maintaining dominant market position. The Idaho Stibnite deposit holds approximately 67,000 tons of antimony reserves. The Biden administration expects this mine to meet >35% of U.S. annual antimony demand (implying ~15,000-20,000 tons/year US usage).
• **Import Dependencies:** The EU was heavily dependent on Chinese antimony imports until shipments were restricted by Chinese export controls implemented in September 2024. The U.S. currently has no primary antimony supply. Battery-industry sources (Clarios, Hoppecke, GS Yuasa) are experiencing antimony shortages and regard U.S. supply development as critical.
• **Demand Projections:** Market analysts highlight strong antimony demand growth from solar PV and defense applications. Chinese export restrictions (affecting ~60% of global supply) signal imminent price surges, implying higher Western stockpiling requirements.
• **Supply Routes:** Recent developments note specific allied projects: Perpetua Resources (Idaho) and United States Antimony Corporation (Montana) in the U.S. are prime supply-side players. Australia's Trafigura is directed to produce antimony byproduct from Port Pirie.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Geochemical mapping; IP/resistivity surveys; hyperspectral imaging; stream sediment analysis*

• **Geological Mapping & Sampling:** Antimony (stibnite, Sb₂S₃) is typically found in epithermal vein systems (e.g., Idaho's Stibnite district). Detailed field mapping and rock-chip/soil geochemistry are primary tools: scanning for antimony-bearing quartz veins, and for pathfinder elements (arsenic, thallium, gold) in streams/soils. Geochemical grids of stream sediment or soil samples can reveal antimony anomalies downstream from ore bodies.

• **Geophysical Surveys (IP/Resistivity):** Induced-polarization (IP) surveys are effective because stibnite and associated sulfides produce high chargeability contrasts. IP and resistivity surveys can outline sulfide-rich vein zones even under cover. Many antimony-gold prospects were first inferred from IP anomalies. Airborne magnetics and radiometrics (for alteration minerals) may assist in mapping hydrothermal systems.

• **Remote Sensing:** Hyperspectral and multispectral satellite/airborne imagery can detect hydrothermal alteration minerals (e.g., kaolinite, sericite, calcite) indicative of antimony-enriched epithermal systems. High-resolution LiDAR and photogrammetry help target outcropping vein trends in rough terrain.

• **Data Analytics & Modeling:** Modern exploration includes integrating geological databases and AI algorithms. For example, combining airborne geochemistry with structural models to highlight hidden antimony deposits. This approach is still emerging for antimony but follows patterns used in other base-metals exploration.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Underground mining; flotation concentration; gravity separation; roasting*

• **Mining Methods:** Stibnite deposits are commonly mined via underground or open-pit methods. For example, Perpetua intends decline and drift development to access vein-hosted antimony ore. Cut-and-fill or shrinkage stoping would be used for steep veins. Bulk underground mining enables extraction of stibnite veins and quartz gangue.

• **Ore Preconcentration:** Crushed ore is usually enriched by gravity and flotation. Flotation cells with xanthate collectors concentrate Sb₂S₃ from gangue. Modern plants often include gravity spirals (since stibnite has relatively high specific gravity of 4.6) to pre-concentrate the ore.

• **Smelting/Roasting:** Stibnite concentrate is roasted in furnaces (fluidized-bed or rotary kilns) at 550-650°C to convert Sb₂S₃ → Sb₂O₃ (antimony trioxide) with release of SO₂ gas (captured by scrubbers). The roasted Sb₂O₃ can then be sold as oxide or further reduced. Roasting remains the primary extraction path for antimony from ore.

• **Hydrometallurgical Extraction:** Emerging projects may use pressure leaching technology. For example, autoclave leaching in H₂SO₄ or alkaline solutions can dissolve antimony from fine concentrate, allowing liquid-solid separation. This also co-extracts trace gold in deposits like Stibnite, which then requires separate recovery (by carbon-in-pulp or cyanidation).

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Oxidative roasting; carbothermic reduction; electrolytic refining; vacuum distillation*

• **Roasting & Oxidation:** Stibnite (Sb₂S₃) concentrate is oxidized to antimony trioxide (Sb₂O₃) via controlled roasting (550-650°C). The process produces Sb₂O₃ (flame-retardant grade) and sulfur dioxide. Modern plants use fluidized-bed roasters for high recovery rates >95%.

• **Blast Furnace/Reduction:** Sb₂O₃ from roasting is reduced by carbon or iron in a reverberatory furnace to produce metallic antimony (typically 99-99.5% purity). Reactions: Sb₂O₃ + 3C → 2Sb + 3CO or Sb₂O₃ + 3Fe → 2Sb + Fe₃O₄. The antimony metal is tapped from the furnace bottom.

• **Electrolytic Refining:** Crude antimony metal can be refined electrolytically. Anodes of impure antimony are dissolved in chloride or fluoride electrolytes, and high-purity antimony is deposited on cathodes. This removes residual impurities like bismuth, lead, or arsenic. Few plants exist globally; many rely on pyrometallurgical methods.

• **Distillation & Purification:** High-purity (99.95+% Sb) is often achieved by vacuum distillation of cast antimony. Metallic antimony has relatively high vapor pressure at elevated temperatures, allowing separation from less volatile impurities. Chinese refineries pioneered many such techniques, now restricted from export.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Pressure leaching; zone refining; vacuum distillation; electrolytic purification*

• **Hydrometallurgical Processing:** Some refining schemes dissolve antimony in hot chloride/sulfate solutions under pressure to separate it from gold and other metals. For instance, pressure leaching with FeCl₃ yields antimony in solution which is precipitated by neutralization. These are limited to pilot or niche operations.

• **Vacuum Distillation:** Modern refineries use vacuum distillation at 900-1000°C to produce high-purity antimony metal (>99.9%). The process exploits antimony's relatively high vapor pressure to separate it from less volatile impurities.

• **Zone Refining:** For semiconductor or battery-grade antimony (ppm impurity levels), multi-pass zone melting refines cast antimony bars. This is a niche technique used in specialized facilities for ultra-high purity applications.

• **Slag Treatment:** Recovery of antimony from slags involves reduction smelting with carbon and flux additions. This secondary recovery can add 5-10% to overall antimony recovery from primary ores.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Lime neutralization; constructed wetlands; iron-based adsorbents; phytostabilization*

• **Acid Mine Drainage Treatment:** Stibnite and co-sulfide ores can generate acidic drainage containing antimony, arsenic, and heavy metals. Common remediation is lime (CaO/Ca(OH)₂) dosing to neutralize pH and precipitate metals as hydroxides. The resulting sludge contains iron-antimony oxyhydroxides that can be filtered out.

• **Constructed Wetlands:** Engineered wetlands with iron-oxidizing bacteria and plants can treat antimony-contaminated water. For example, wetlands with Fe(II)-fed bioreactors promote precipitation of antimony-iron oxyhydroxides. These passive systems have been trialed at antimony and arsenic mine sites.

• **Adsorption/Sorption Media:** Engineered sorbents (e.g., granular ferric hydroxide, modified biochar, mesoporous alumina) are used to capture antimony species from solution. Pilot projects in allied regions use iron-coated sand filters to polish antimony-contaminated effluent to <10 ppb levels.

• **Revegetation and Erosion Control:** Since antimony-bearing tailings are often sulfide-rich, mine closure plans include covering tailings with inert caps and using metal-tolerant plants. Phytostabilization uses grasses or shrubs to limit erosion of antimony-laden soils while minimizing plant uptake and translocation.

## References for mining technologies
• **Process flows and smelting:** Chinese export controls expressly forbid licensing of antimony smelting and separation technology, underscoring the specialized nature of antimony processing. Port Pirie's retrofitting (Australia) illustrates byproduct extraction via existing lead smelter technology. The Stibnite project's development (U.S.) confirms ore characteristics that dictate extraction methods.
• **Concentrate production:** The Stibnite deposit's ore grade and reserves inform expected milling throughput. Reports on record-high antimony prices (due to solar demand) and battery sector shortages reflect how market conditions are driving new extraction projects and recycling initiatives in allied countries.
• **Others:** Industry developments (United States Antimony Corporation's Montana expansion) highlight the current lack of Western refining capacity. Collectively, these sources validate the technical routes (roasting, reduction, precipitation) that allies must rely on given their technology gaps.

## Key Bottleneck summary
Allied production is constrained by **limited processing technology and capacity**. No Western country has integrated antimony refining complexes like those in China, and Chinese controls restrict technology transfers. Thus, despite potential new ore sources (Idaho, etc.), the lack of domestic purification/refinery plants means the U.S. and its allies will struggle to convert raw ore into usable antimony metal without significant investment in processing infrastructure or joint ventures with countries that possess refining capabilities.
