## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States – Mountain Pass (CA):** MP Materials’ reopened mine produced a record 45,000 metric tons of rare-earth oxide (REO) concentrate in 2024 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  Cerium comprises roughly half of this concentrate (≈50.2 % by mass ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=match%20at%20L2502%20Cerium%20,))), implying on the order of ~22,500 t of CeO₂ content.  This makes Mountain Pass by far the sole domestic REE source of scale.  
• **Australia – Mount Weld (WA):** Lynas Rare Earths mined ~10,908 t of REO (FY2024) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=1117%20%20,Total%20NdPr%20production)).  The Mt. Weld nepheline syenite ore is rich in light REEs (La/Ce), so a large fraction of this (estimated ~3–4 kt) is Ce content.  Lynas then ships this concentrate to its Malaysian processing plant.  
• **Canada:** Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (N.W.T.) – first shipments of high-grade bastnäsite concentrate began in 2021 ([www.miningmagazine.com](https://www.miningmagazine.com/management/news-articles/1432766/report-nechalacho-begins-rare-earths-deliveries#:~:text=Production%20at%20Nechalacho%20began%20in,China%2C%20the%20Canadian%20Press%20said)).  Vital plans to ramp to ~25,000 t/yr REO concentrate by 2025 ([www.miningmagazine.com](https://www.miningmagazine.com/management/news-articles/1432766/report-nechalacho-begins-rare-earths-deliveries#:~:text=Production%20at%20Nechalacho%20began%20in,China%2C%20the%20Canadian%20Press%20said)).  At ~50% Ce, this could correspond to ~12,500 t Ce.  (Separately, Energy Fuels (US) cracks monazite in Utah, selling mixed rare-earth carbonate to Neo in Estonia for separation ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2378454-canada-s-rare-earth-processing-hub-prepares-to-ramp-up#:~:text=The%20only%20other%20monazite%20producer,Estonia%20for%20sale%20to%20customers)), effectively outsourcing Ce content to allied processing.)  
• **European Union (and Norway/Iceland):** No primary Ce mining is yet in production.  Current “domestic” supply comes via processing of imported concentrates (e.g. Canadian/US feedstocks refined by Neo Performance, or recycles).  The EU imported ∼5.4 Mt cerium compounds (5,412.9 t) in 2022 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2022/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/284610#:~:text=France%20%20%20,Kg)) (mostly for materials manufacturing).  Any allied domestic Ce output (e.g. proposed Finnish or Greenland mines) is still exploration-stage.  
• **Japan:** Zero domestic mining.  Japan imported ∼7,593 t of cerium compounds in 2022 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2022/tradeflow/Imports/partner/WLD/product/284610#:~:text=,Kg)) (for glass, catalysts, electronics).  (Iceland and Norway have no REE mines; they rely on EU/Japan/RoW sources.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Allied demand for cerium (Ce) is driven chiefly by automotive catalysts, glass polishing, and certain oxides in electronics.  In 2022 the US, EU, and Japan together imported on the order of 22,000 t of Ce compounds ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2022/tradeflow/Imports/partner/WLD/product/284610#:~:text=,Kg)) (US ~2,964 t, EU ~11,835 t, Japan ~7,593 t).  Even with rapid EV adoption (which increases NdFeB magnet use but actually reduces need for automotive catalysts), Ce demand is expected to grow only moderately.  For instance, catalytic converter loadings and glass polishing needs could each rise a few percent per year, suggesting 2030 allied demand perhaps in the 30–40 kt/yr range.  (Industry analysts note that Ce – like La – is often “overproduced” relative to demand ([www.adamasintel.com](https://www.adamasintel.com/unfathomable-rare-earth-demand-growth/#:~:text=magnet%20rare%20earth%20demand%20growth%2C,such%20as%20cerium%20and%20lanthanum)), implying that growth in traditional uses will not match magnet-REE growth.)  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Assuming planned projects succeed, allied Ce-containing output by 2030 could reach the order of 50–80 kt/year.  Key components: 
- **US –** Mountain Pass: maintained ~45 kt REO (2024) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) (~22 kt Ce).  Expanded Stage II (to 6 kt NdPr) implies roughly 20–25 kt REO/year for other LREE by mid-2020s ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=individual%20rare%20earth%20products%20at,material%20adverse%20effect%20on%20our)).  Ce output may approach 25–30 kt/yr by 2030 as full-stage mining continues.  
- **Australia –** Lynas: ~10.9 kt REO (FY24) ([www.marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LYNAS-RARE-EARTHS-LIMITED-6492543/news/Lynas-Rare-Earths-Annual-Report-FY2024-48046884/#:~:text=1117%20%20,Total%20NdPr%20production)).  Lynas is not expanding production beyond Mt Weld in near term, so similar 11 kt is assumed, ~3–4 kt Ce.  
- **Canada –** Vital Metals: 25 kt REO by 2025 ([www.miningmagazine.com](https://www.miningmagazine.com/management/news-articles/1432766/report-nechalacho-begins-rare-earths-deliveries#:~:text=Production%20at%20Nechalacho%20began%20in,China%2C%20the%20Canadian%20Press%20said)) (~12 kt Ce).  Continued development (e.g. Tardiff deposit) could sustain 25 kt+ beyond 2025.  
- **EU –** Potential new producers (e.g. Greenland’s Kvanefjeld project, Finnish K60) might not be online by 2030.  Some processing (e.g., Estonia’s plant) is geared to NdPr (virtually Ce removed before sale).  Without domestic mines, EU “supply” will remain imports.  
- **Japan/Norway/Iceland –** No change (no mines).  Japan will continue to import tens of thousands of tons per year, chiefly from allied miners (Lynas, Vital, etc.).  

Combined, by 2030 US+Canada+Australia could supply on the order of ~80–100 kt REO/year (of which Ce ~45–50 kt) if all targets are met.  (Reference volumes above.)

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne or ground gamma-ray spectrometry detects Th/U anomalies often associated with REE-bearing minerals (monazite, bastnäsite).  Many carbonatite/monazite districts (e.g. Mt. Weld, Abitibi placer sands) were first identified via U/Th exploration or gamma mapping.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Field mapping highlights alkaline-igneous (carbonatite/pegmatite) or sediment-host environments.  Systematic sampling (stream sediments, soils, rocks) for REE geochemical anomalies pinpoints targets.  For example, USGS studies in the Southeast U.S. used paired geophysical and geochemical mapping to reveal heavy-mineral placer belts ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-and-geochemical-approaches-evaluating-rare-earth-element-ree#:~:text=studies%20have%20indicated%20the%20presence,field%20studies%20at%20specific%20sites)).  
• **Airborne Geophysics:** Magnetics and gravity surveys can outline carbonatite cores (often magnetic).  Radiometric (gamma) surveys complement by flagging REE-mineralized zones (via Th/K ratios).  Modern hyperspectral imaging (satellite or drone) may detect alteration minerals or vegetation stress signals indicative of REE-rich lithologies.  
• **Stream & Soil Sampling:** In tropical/subtropical climates, fine-clay regolith or stream sediments can concentrate weathered REEs (e.g. ion-adsorption clays).  Tiered geochem (XRF/ICP) of regolith profiles and drainage sediments helps find concealed REE.  
• **Drilling (Ground Truthing):** Diamond or rotary drilling of identified targets (spas, carbonatite dikes, placer deposits) is essential to quantify grades and tonnages once prospects are defined by above methods.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Froth Flotation:** Concentrates REE minerals (bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime) from ore by differential flotation (e.g. separating fluorocarbonates from calcite/quartz).  Produces high-grade RE feed for hydrometallurgy.  
• **Caustic (Alkali) Roast + Acid Leach:** Finely ground bastnäsite is roasted with NaOH (or with air) at high temperature to break down the carbonate matrix.  The calcine is then leached with sulfuric or hydrochloric acid.  For example, oxidative roasting (~500–1,000 °C) followed by HCl dissolves REE chlorides while leaving CeO₂ “high side” ([trea.com](https://trea.com/information/process-of-rare-earth-recovery-from-ores-containing-bastnaesite/patentapplication/7a263fe6-9539-416a-a302-86f6c9fee7b5#:~:text=Oxidation%20roasting%2FHCl%20leach%20process%3A%20This,for%201)).  Acid baking can extract ~80–85% of REEs ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/12/7/1133?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=study,%C2%B0C%20in%20oxidizing%20medium%2C%20and)).  
• **Direct Acid Leaching:** Some ores (oxysalts, monazite) can be roasted with concentrated H₂SO₄ (or HCl) to form soluble REE sulphates/chlorides.  Controlled acid baking (e.g. 90 °C, high acid) yields ~80+% REE recovery ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/12/7/1133?type=check_update&version=1#:~:text=study,%C2%B0C%20in%20oxidizing%20medium%2C%20and)).  Monazite often requires HF addition or a H₂SO₄ fusion step (to handle phosphate).  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX) and Precipitation:** After leach, REEs are in solution.  Common industry practice is to precipitate a mixed REE carbonate/oxide as an intermediate, or directly scrub with SX solvents (e.g. acidic organophosphorus extractants) to purify REEs into separate element streams.  In roasting/H₂SO₄ flowsheets, REEs can be precipitated as oxalates or carbonates and calcined to oxides.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Oxidative Precipitation:** Techniques exploit Ce’s ability to oxidize from Ce³⁺ to Ce⁴⁺.  In alkaline solution with oxidant, Ce(OH)₄ precipitates while other lanthanides remain soluble as Ln(OH)₃ ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312541521_Separation_of_ceriumIII_from_lanthanumIII_neodymiumIII_and_praseodymiumIII_by_oxidation_and_liquid-liquid_extraction_using_ionic_liquids#:~:text=Ce%203%2B%20to%20Ce%204%2B,aqueous%20lanthanoid%20salt%20mixture%20formed)).  (For example, treating a La–Ce–Nd–Pr solution with O₂ under basic conditions yields Ce(OH)₄ precipitate ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312541521_Separation_of_ceriumIII_from_lanthanumIII_neodymiumIII_and_praseodymiumIII_by_oxidation_and_liquid-liquid_extraction_using_ionic_liquids#:~:text=Ce%203%2B%20to%20Ce%204%2B,aqueous%20lanthanoid%20salt%20mixture%20formed)).)  At Mountain Pass, Ce is similarly oxidized to insoluble CeO₂ early, removing it from processing ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=mixed%20rare%20earth%20concentrate%20to,for%20up%20to%20a%2040)).  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** Liquid-liquid extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, P204, ionic liquid systems) can fractionate light REEs.  Ce is often selectively removed in early SX stages by adjusting pH or using chloride media (e.g. Ce remains as insoluble CeO₂ in HCl leach ([trea.com](https://trea.com/information/process-of-rare-earth-recovery-from-ores-containing-bastnaesite/patentapplication/7a263fe6-9539-416a-a302-86f6c9fee7b5#:~:text=Oxidation%20roasting%2FHCl%20leach%20process%3A%20This,for%201))).  Sophisticated SX schemes or ionic-liquid extraction tools allow separation of Ce from La/Nd.  
• **Ion-Exchange / Chromatography:** Continuous (simulated-moving-bed) ion-exchange columns can separate Ce by exploiting slight differences in resin affinities.  These methods can achieve high-purity Ce products when combined with controlled pH and complexing agents.  
• **Precipitation/Crystallization:** After SX or ion-exchange, Ce can be crystallized as Ce oxalate or carbonate by chemical addition (e.g. oxalic acid or (NH₄)₂CO₃) and then calcined to CeO₂.  Adjusting redox or pH allows selective crystallization of Ce.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Re-precipitation & Calcination:** Impure Ce compounds (hydroxide/carbonate) are redissolved and re-precipitated (e.g. via pH control or oxalate) to remove impurities, then calcined.  The result is high-purity cerium oxide (CeO₂), the feedstock for most Ce products (polishing powders, glass additives).  
• **Chlorination & Molten-Salt Electrolysis:** For metal, CeO₂ or Ce₂(CO₃)₃ is converted to cerium chloride (CeCl₃) by chlorination.  Anhydrous CeCl₃ is then electrolyzed in a molten chloride bath (e.g. NaCl–KCl eutectic) to produce Ce metal ([inis.iaea.org](https://inis.iaea.org/records/n70hb-92w10#:~:text=0,the%20process%20conducted%20at%20720oC)).  Industrial studies show Ce metal can be extracted from CeCl₃ at ~650–720 °C with ~50–60% yield by fused-salt electrolysis ([inis.iaea.org](https://inis.iaea.org/records/n70hb-92w10#:~:text=0,the%20process%20conducted%20at%20720oC)).  
• **Calciothermic Reduction:** Alternatively, CeF₃ or CeCl₃ can be thermally reduced with calcium metal (analogous to Kroll/Magnéli processes) to yield metallic Ce.  This requires stringent oxygen/water exclusion.  Refined Ce metal can be zone-refined or remelted to achieve desired purity.  
• **Distillation / Solid-State Purification:** Ce metal (b.p. ~3425 °C) can be purified via vacuum distillation or zone melting to remove lower-boiling tramp elements.  These methods are more common at lab/multi-kilo scale than mass production.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Chemical Precipitation:** Waste streams containing Ce³⁺ (from leachate or effluent) can be neutralized with alkaline reagents (e.g. NaOH, Ca(OH)₂) to precipitate Ce(OH)₄.  Added sulfide (Na₂S) or phosphate (H₃PO₄) can co-precipitate Ce as insoluble CeS or CePO₄. Resultant solids are filtered out.  
• **Adsorption / Ion Exchange:** Engineered sorbents (e.g. chelating resins, ion-imprinted polymers) can selectively bind Ce³⁺ from solution.  For example, magnetic mesoporous carbons with Ce-specific binding sites can recover Ce from dilute streams.  Likewise, strong acid cation-exchange columns (e.g. sulfonated polystyrene) can mop up Ce, which is later eluted.  
• **Membrane & Filtration:** Nanofiltration or reverse-osmosis membranes can concentrate Ce from process water, after which precipitative removal is easier.  Ceramic adsorption filters (e.g. metal-oxide ceramics) can also capture REEs.  
• **Bioremediation:** Certain microorganisms (fungi, bacteria) and plants (e.g. *Broussonetia papyrifera*, *Scenedesmus*) bioaccumulate Ce.  Bioreactors or constructed wetlands with these organisms can extract Ce from wastewater.  The biomass is then harvested and processed.  
• **Solidification/Stabilization:** Mining and process residues containing Ce (and any radioactive Th) can be mixed with cement or geopolymers to lock in contaminants, reducing leachability.  In tailings ponds, pH and redox are controlled to prevent Ce mobilization.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The main bottleneck is handling cerium’s large byproduct volume.  Ce typically constitutes ~50% of bastnäsite ore, but allied downstream industries (magnets, etc.) have limited use for it.  This forces producers to implement high-capacity Ce removal early in processing – for example, oxidative roasting and HCl leaching to precipitate CeO₂ ([trea.com](https://trea.com/information/process-of-rare-earth-recovery-from-ores-containing-bastnaesite/patentapplication/7a263fe6-9539-416a-a302-86f6c9fee7b5#:~:text=Oxidation%20roasting%2FHCl%20leach%20process%3A%20This,for%201)). In practice, the infrastructure to separate, refine or stockpile tens of kilotons of Ce is underdeveloped.  Put simply, the shortage of demand and finishing capacity for bulk Ce (oxide or metal) makes its separation and refinement the rate-limiting step in allied REE production ([www.adamasintel.com](https://www.adamasintel.com/unfathomable-rare-earth-demand-growth/#:~:text=magnet%20rare%20earth%20demand%20growth%2C,such%20as%20cerium%20and%20lanthanum)) ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=mixed%20rare%20earth%20concentrate%20to,for%20up%20to%20a%2040)).  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Cerium presents a root challenge: it is plentiful in Western ores but lacking a strong domestic market, so Allied producers must continuously strip it out as a “sacrificial” byproduct ([www.adamasintel.com](https://www.adamasintel.com/unfathomable-rare-earth-demand-growth/#:~:text=magnet%20rare%20earth%20demand%20growth%2C,such%20as%20cerium%20and%20lanthanum)).  Technologically, this means scaling up Ce-specific separation (oxidation/precipitation) and purification steps to cope with the volume – processes not needed for Nd/Pr alone.  Until refined Ce uses or recycling paths grow, Ce removal (and provisioning of CeO₂ stockpiles) will remain the chokepoint of the Allied rare-earth supply chain ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136822000010/mp-20211231.htm#:~:text=mixed%20rare%20earth%20concentrate%20to,for%20up%20to%20a%2040)) ([www.adamasintel.com](https://www.adamasintel.com/unfathomable-rare-earth-demand-growth/#:~:text=magnet%20rare%20earth%20demand%20growth%2C,such%20as%20cerium%20and%20lanthanum)).
