## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** 0 t (no active tin mines; last production was in 1993 ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/data/tin-deposits-united-states#:~:text=alloys%2C%20chemicals%2C%20and%20solder%2C%20amongst,a%20net%20import%20reliance%20as))). US tin supply is entirely import/recycled.  
• **Canada:** ≈0 t (no primary cassiterite mines; any tin is byproduct of other mining).  
• **Australia:** ~9,532 t (2023) from the Renison underground mine in Tasmania ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/metals-x-reports-increase-in-renison-annual-production-and-new-off-take-agreement-with-yunnan-tin/#:~:text=Contained%20tin%20production%20from%20Rension,from%208%2C404%20in%202022)) (jointly operated by Metals X/Yunnan Tin).  
• **EU (incl. Norway/Iceland):** ~0 t (no primary tin mines; reliant on scrap recovery and imports).  
• **Japan:** 0 t (all tin is imported or recycled).  
• **Allies total:** essentially all rely on imports – e.g. US net import reliance ~75% ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/data/tin-deposits-united-states#:~:text=alloys%2C%20chemicals%2C%20and%20solder%2C%20amongst,States%2C%20tin%20most%20commonly%20occurs)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **United States:** ~130,000 t (assuming ~4–5% p.a. growth on ~92,200 t in 2022 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/16/2629015/0/en/Global-Tin-Market-to-Reach-481-9-Thousand-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=The%20U,forecast%20to%20reach%20a%20projected))). Tin is critical in solder for electronics/EVs (≈50% of use ([investingnews.com](https://investingnews.com/top-tin-producing-countries/#:~:text=Tin%20remains%20essential%20for%20renewable,mobile%20phones%2C%20and%20electric%20cars))).  
• **EU+Norway/Iceland:** ~60,000 t (EU consumes ≈13% of global tin ([www.raiffeisenresearch.com](https://www.raiffeisenresearch.com/servlet/NoAuthLibraryServlet?action=viewDocument&encrypt=147bc777-862f-4000-a6e0-2078daf1ea57&id=replaceme%40bluematrix.com&mime=HTML#:~:text=China%20remains%20the%20largest%20consumer,and%20the%20USA%20%2811)); projected ~13% of a ~482,000 t global market by 2030 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/16/2629015/0/en/Global-Tin-Market-to-Reach-481-9-Thousand-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=In%20the%20changed%20post%20COVID,While%20China%20is%20Forecast%20to))).  
• **Japan:** ~8,000 t (small market; forecast ~3.4% CAGR ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/16/2629015/0/en/Global-Tin-Market-to-Reach-481-9-Thousand-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=China%2C%20the%20world,CAGR))).  
• **Canada:** ~5,000 t (forecast ~4% CAGR ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2023/03/16/2629015/0/en/Global-Tin-Market-to-Reach-481-9-Thousand-Tons-by-2030.html#:~:text=China%2C%20the%20world,CAGR))).  
• **Australia:** Domestic demand minor (most tin is exported – production ≈9,500 t ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/metals-x-reports-increase-in-renison-annual-production-and-new-off-take-agreement-with-yunnan-tin/#:~:text=Contained%20tin%20production%20from%20Rension,from%208%2C404%20in%202022))).  
• **Allies total:** On the order of ~~200–210,000 t by 2030 (sum of above).   

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Recycling:** Scrap/recycled tin will supply ~25–35% of demand. 2023 ITA survey shows ~34% of global tin demand met by recycled content ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/ita-study-tin-use-in-recovery-cycle/?v=7885444af42e#:~:text=forms%20totalled%20433%2C000%20tonnes%20in,in%202024)). In the US this was ~25% in 2017 ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/data/tin-deposits-united-states#:~:text=alloys%2C%20chemicals%2C%20and%20solder%2C%20amongst,States%2C%20tin%20most%20commonly%20occurs)) (≈25–35 kt for 2030). Allies likely achieve at least 20–30% from recycling (EU has strong electronics-recycling).  
• **Australia:** ~9,500 t/yr (Renison production ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/metals-x-reports-increase-in-renison-annual-production-and-new-off-take-agreement-with-yunnan-tin/#:~:text=Contained%20tin%20production%20from%20Rension,from%208%2C404%20in%202022))) into 2030 – the only significant allied mine output.  
• **North America / EU:** No new primary supply; only scrap/byproduct sources (e.g. tin in Cu-Zn tailings) if developed.  
• **Imports:** The balance of supply must be imported from friendly producers (e.g. Peru’s Minsur, DRC, Myanmar, Indonesia). Allies have no domestic source to meet rising demand.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Field mapping targets granitic/granophyric intrusions (greisens, pegmatites, skarn veins) that host cassiterite. Surface geochemical surveys (stream/soil sampling) detect tin pathfinders (As, W, Mo) – e.g. Sn–Mo–Bi anomalies identified in Brazilian greisen tin fields ([www.scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/remi/a/yPGPnJTDQ6LVPm3xyQHDW8d/#:~:text=accompanied%20by%20pyrite%2C%20arsenopyrite%20and,models%20in%20greisens%20filonean%20bodies)). Remote sensing (multispectral/hyperspectral) can search for alteration minerals (muscovite, tourmaline) associated with tin.  
• **Geophysical Methods:** Airborne radiometrics (gamma) are generally ineffective by themselves (cassiterite is non-radioactive), but induced-polarization (IP) and resistivity surveys can locate sulfide halos around tin veins. For example, a Brazilian study used IP tomography to outline a 36 m-long high-chargeability zone (5.0+ mV/V) coincident with cassiterite-bearing greisen ([www.scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/remi/a/yPGPnJTDQ6LVPm3xyQHDW8d/#:~:text=that%20the%20mineralized%20zone%20apparently,high%20polarizability%20of%20the%20sulfides)). Gravity surveys (dense cassiterite) and magnetics (mapping magnetite-rich granites) can also hint at concealed tin lodes.  
• **Drilling & Sampling:** High-precision drilling (core/RC) with portable assay/XRF is crucial to test targets. Modern 3D geological modeling integrates drill data with geophysics. Novel methods like tin isotope fingerprinting (Sn isotopes in cassiterite) are emerging to tie deposits to source models, but surface discovery still relies on classic field and airborne survey work ([www.scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/remi/a/yPGPnJTDQ6LVPm3xyQHDW8d/#:~:text=accompanied%20by%20pyrite%2C%20arsenopyrite%20and,models%20in%20greisens%20filonean%20bodies)) ([www.scielo.br](https://www.scielo.br/j/remi/a/yPGPnJTDQ6LVPm3xyQHDW8d/#:~:text=that%20the%20mineralized%20zone%20apparently,high%20polarizability%20of%20the%20sulfides)).  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Underground Mining:** Tin ore (cassiterite) is almost exclusively mined underground in hard rock deposits. At sites like Tasmania’s Renison, mechanized drill-and-blast stoping (with declines and ramps) is used ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/metals-x-reports-increase-in-renison-annual-production-and-new-off-take-agreement-with-yunnan-tin/#:~:text=Contained%20tin%20production%20from%20Rension,from%208%2C404%20in%202022)). Continuous dewatering, ventilation and ore handling systems keep deep tin mines operational (Renison drilled >13,000 m in 2023 ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/metals-x-reports-increase-in-renison-annual-production-and-new-off-take-agreement-with-yunnan-tin/#:~:text=dewatering%20at%20the%20North%20Renison,Area%205%20among%20other%20stopes))).  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Old tin mine tailings often contain recoverable tin. The “Rentails” project at Renison, for example, is re-processing tailings using a fluidized-bed furnace to extract tin concentrate ([www.internationaltin.org](https://www.internationaltin.org/metals-x-reports-increase-in-renison-annual-production-and-new-off-take-agreement-with-yunnan-tin/#:~:text=Providing%20an%20update%20on%20the,management%20of%20the%20tailings%20dams)). Such technologies (gravity recirculation, wet high-intensity magnetic separation) can add production by mining legacy waste.  
• **Alluvial Dredging (Historical):** In Asia, floating dredges sift tin sands; no allied examples currently. (All current allied projects are hard-rock.)  
• **Emergency Extraction:** Innovations like robotic or trackless mining vehicles, and adaptive cut-and-fill methods, improve safety/efficiency at depth. However, with no US/EU tin mines, extraction tech is exercised mainly by Australian and Latin producers.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Gravity Concentration:** Cassiterite’s high density is exploited by spirals, jigs and shaking tables. Coarse ore is pulped and gravity-separated to recover the bulk of tin. Recent reviews note advances in gravity separation equipment (e.g. spiral design, centrifugal concentrators) to handle ultra-fine cassiterite ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11771-023-5245-4#:~:text=natural%20resources%20and%20secondary%20resources,in%20recent%20years%2C%20which%20will)).  
• **Flotation:** Fine cassiterite (<0.1–0.15 mm) is floated using specialty anionic collectors (e.g. sulfosuccinates, hydroxamates). Innovations such as carrier flotation and bio-based collectors improve recovery of ultrafine tin ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11771-023-5245-4#:~:text=natural%20resources%20and%20secondary%20resources,in%20recent%20years%2C%20which%20will)). Typical plant flowsheets combine gravity roughing with cleaner flotation to produce a high-grade Sn concentrate.  
• **Dense Media & Electrostatic Separation:** For coarse pre-concentration, dense-media separation (suspensions of magnetite or glass beads) separates heavy cassiterite from gangue. Electrostatic (high-voltage) separators exploit cassiterite’s high electrical resistivity to capture fine SnO₂ particles on charged surfaces. (These are used in some Chinese and Southeast Asian processing plants.)  
• **Magnetic Separation:** Weak magnetic separators remove magnetite/iron from concentrates. While cassiterite itself is non-magnetic, magnetic separation is often used downstream to clean tin concentrates (e.g., removing tramp magnetite or ilmenite).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Pyrometallurgy (Smelting):** Tin concentrate is smelted in reverberatory or rotary furnaces with reductants (carbon), producing crude tin metal (up to ~90–95% Sn). Fluxes (NaOH, KCN) and slag-formers (carbonate minerals) capture impurities (Fe, As, Zn). The crude metal (“hard tin”) is then further refined.  
• **Vacuum Distillation:** Multi-stage vacuum furnaces are used to separate tin from lead and other volatile contaminants. For example, vacuum distillation of a tin–lead alloy yields >99% tin (Sn) and ~98% Pb ([www.metalcess.com](https://www.metalcess.com/knowhow/metal_vacuum_distillation/Soldering_Tin_Purification_108_show.html#:~:text=The%20tin%20%26%20lead%20alloy%2C,for%20tin%20%26%20lead%20separation)). Companies like Metalcess achieve ~97–99.8% tin recovery by staged vacuum distillation to purify solder-grade tin ([www.metalcess.com](https://www.metalcess.com/knowhow/metal_vacuum_distillation/Soldering_Tin_Purification_108_show.html#:~:text=The%20tin%20%26%20lead%20alloy%2C,for%20tin%20%26%20lead%20separation)).  
• **Electrowinning/Electrorefining:** Crude tin can be refined electrolytically. An impure tin anode is dissolved in a suitable electrolyte and deposited as high-purity tin cathode (often >99.95% Sn) for semiconductor/lead-free alloys. (Japan’s JX Nippon and others deploy such processes to meet 4N–5N purity requirements.)  
• **Chemical Purification:** Hydro- or pyrometallurgical purification (e.g. sulfuric acid leaching of oxide from smelter anodes, followed by electrowinning) is used on byproduct tin (e.g. refining residue). Garbage acidic fumes (Cl₂, etc.) are scrubbed, and lead/bismuth are removed via distillation or alkali roast before final electrolysis.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Solidification/Stabilization (S/S):** Binders (cement, fly ash, lime) are mixed with arsenic-laden tin tailings to immobilize contaminants. Ca(OH)₂ and aluminates from cement hydration form insoluble arsenates (ettringite, calcium-arsenate) and calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) gels, binding As/Sn in a stable matrix ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9517127/#:~:text=a%20series%20of%20characterization%20tests%2C,treatment%20of%20TT%20and%20its)). This rapidly drops arsenic leachate below regulatory limits (e.g. <0.1 mg/L) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9517127/#:~:text=a%20series%20of%20characterization%20tests%2C,treatment%20of%20TT%20and%20its)). Blended cements (e.g. low-alkali, slag-based) can lower costs and CO₂.  
• **Phytoremediation & Bioremediation:** Certain plants (fern *Pteris vittata*, *Scirpus* spp.) hyperaccumulate arsenic and tin from soils. Microbial consortia (iron- or sulfate-reducers) can precipitate metals from effluents. These biological approaches are being tested in mine closure: e.g. *P. vittata* has shown up to ~100% As uptake in tailings cover layers, reducing mobility.  
• **Soil Washing/Chemical Extraction:** Acidic or chelant (e.g. EDTA) washes of contaminated soils/tailings dissolve metal(loid)s for capture. For example, treatment with Fe(II) salts co-precipitates As from groundwater. Alkaline flushing (limestone or dolomite) can neutralize acid mine drainage. These physico-chemical treatments recover tin/As into a smaller waste stream.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
Allied tin output is fundamentally bottlenecked by **resource availability**, not machinery. The USGS notes the U.S. has *no active tin mining* ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/data/tin-deposits-united-states#:~:text=alloys%2C%20chemicals%2C%20and%20solder%2C%20amongst,a%20net%20import%20reliance%20as)), so allied production hinges on small, unconventional sources. The critical “technology gap” is therefore in raw feed – advanced recycling or novel ores. For instance, vacuum-distillation and electrowinning can purify tin ([www.metalcess.com](https://www.metalcess.com/knowhow/metal_vacuum_distillation/Soldering_Tin_Purification_108_show.html#:~:text=The%20tin%20%26%20lead%20alloy%2C,for%20tin%20%26%20lead%20separation)) but cannot create tin from nothing. In practice, even perfect extraction/purification tech cannot overcome the lack of domestic cassiterite. Thus, allied countries rely on imports and recycling; discovery of new viable tin deposits (e.g. in Alaska, Greenland, Scandinavia) is the true limiting factor. 

## Key Bottleneck summary (2–4 sentences)  
In summary, US and allied tin production is starved of ore – there is essentially no domestic cassiterite to mine ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/data/tin-deposits-united-states#:~:text=alloys%2C%20chemicals%2C%20and%20solder%2C%20amongst,a%20net%20import%20reliance%20as)). All proposed tech (recycling, tailings retreatment, vacuum refining ([www.metalcess.com](https://www.metalcess.com/knowhow/metal_vacuum_distillation/Soldering_Tin_Purification_108_show.html#:~:text=The%20tin%20%26%20lead%20alloy%2C,for%20tin%20%26%20lead%20separation)), etc.) addresses secondary supply, but without a major new deposit these efforts only partially offset import dependence. The narrowest bottleneck is thus feedstock: without high-grade domestic sources, tin output cannot rise meaningfully, leaving allies reliant on friendly foreign suppliers.
