## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States** – Only one active REE mine (MP Materials’ Mountain Pass, CA). In 2023 MP reported ~10,766 t of rare-earth concentrate produced through Q3 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2023-results#:~:text=Stage%20I%20REO%20sales%20and,and%2010%2C766%20metric%20tons%2C%20respectively)) (projected ~13–14 kt REO/yr). Terbium constitutes a small fraction (<1%) of this output ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense)). The US has ~13.7 kt/yr total rare-earth output (mostly light REEs) at Mountain Pass. China still controls >90% of Tb supply ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=predominantly%20extracted%20as%20a%20byproduct,Australia)), so US production covers only a few hundred tonnes of Tb annually.  
• **Australia** – Lynas Rare Earths’ Mt. Weld (WA) dominates allied output. Lynas achieved ~19,737 t total REO in 2019 (incl. 5,898 t NdPr) ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20plant%20reached%20its%20highest,NdPr%29%2C%20in%202019)). In Q1 2024 Lynas produced ~2,722 t REO ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australias-lynas-rare-earths-first-quarter-revenue-falls-nearly-6-2024-10-29/#:~:text=Australia%27s%20Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%20reported,output%20also%20decreased%20to%202%2C722)). Tb is present in minor amounts; Lynas is expanding to increase output (LAMP Stage 2 expansion, new Kalgoorlie leach plant). Northern Minerals (Browns Range, WA) is under development: final DFS in 2024, first heavy-REE (Dy/Tb) concentrate targeted Q4 2027 ([northernminerals.com.au](https://northernminerals.com.au/browns-range-project/#:~:text=Stage%20%20,grid%20renewable%20power%20solutions)).  
• **Canada** – No commercial Tb mine. The Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) has deployed a rare-earth smelter: producing NdPr metal (0.5 μm grain) at 10 t/month (120 t/yr) and scaling to 40 t/month (480 t/yr) by end 2024 ([www.saskatchewan.ca](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2024/september/18/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-to-produce-rare-earth-metals-in-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)). This facility separates NdPr metals but does **not** currently produce Tb. Canada’s Tb supply remains negligible, pending new projects.  
• **Europe (EU/UK/Norway)** – Essentially no domestic Tb production yet. A major carbonatite at Fen, Norway has been drilled (largest REE deposit in continental Europe) ([rareearthsnorway.com](https://rareearthsnorway.com/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-elements-discovered-at-fen-norway#:~:text=The%20Maiden%20Mineral%20Resource%20Estimate,for%20REN%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Europe)), but no mine exists. The EU is pursuing processing capacity (e.g. Solvay La Rochelle, Lynas Kalgoorlie plants) but today relies on imports. Slovakia/Finland/Sweden have applications or small resources (e.g. Norra Kärr, Kaustinen), yet no Tb output.  
• **Iceland/Greenland** – Large REE-oxide deposit (Kvanefjeld, Greenland) containing Tb was approved for development but effectively halted by local referendum; currently zero production.  
• **Japan** – No Tb mining or heavy-REE processing plants. Japan (and allied Asia) is entirely import-dependent, sourcing oxides from China or Lynas.  

Globally, China dominates Tb supply (≈90% of output ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=predominantly%20extracted%20as%20a%20byproduct,Australia))), with US/Australia producing the remaining minor share. Thus US/allied domestic production is on the order of tens of tons of Tb per year (since Tb is <1% of REO output ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense))).

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Permanent Magnets (EVs, Wind, Motors):** Tb is added to NdFeB magnets for high-temperature stability. A modern 3 MW wind turbine may contain ≈2 kg Tb, and a typical electric-vehicle motor ≈0.5–1 kg ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=and%20magnetic%20coercivity,is%20both%20high%20and%20structurally)). With global EV sales projected ~45 million by 2030 ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=and%20magnetic%20coercivity,is%20both%20high%20and%20structurally)) (US/allied portion ~20–30 M), magnet-related Tb demand could easily reach tens of thousands of tonnes annually. For example, 20 M EVs × 0.5 kg ≈10,000 t. Allied wind/EV build rates (EU target 100 GW wind, US ~50 GW, JP ~10 GW) similarly drive Tb needs.  Overall, EV and renewable-energy targets imply Tb demand growth of ~10%/yr through 2030.  
• **Electronics & Lighting (Phosphors/Displays):** Tb-doped phosphors (green phosphors CeMgAl₁₁O₁₉:Tb³⁺) are used in lamps and high-end displays (LCD/OLED). The display/lighting sector consumed ≈40 t of Tb in 2022 ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=%2A%2AElectronics%20and%20Displays%2A%2A%20Terbium,term%20stability%20hinges%20on%20the)) (global). With trends towards high-color-rendering medical/lab lighting and large-area displays, allied demand is estimated at ~10–20 t/yr by 2030 (roughly half of global demand). Extending LED/phosphor lifetime and new phosphor tech are offset by growing device counts.  
• **Defense & Aerospace:** Tb is critical in specialized magnets and alloys for precision-guided munitions, submarines, aircraft actuators, and sensors.  The US Department of Defense highlights Tb’s role in NdFeB magnets (albeit <1% of rare-earth content) ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense)).  Defense demand is “inelastic”: the Pentagon is funding domestic Tb production (e.g. Rare Earth Salts project) to ensure supply ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense)).  Although overall tonnage is modest (~1–5 t/yr), it is strategic.  
• **Other High-Tech Uses:** Emerging green-energy fields (solid-oxide fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysis) use Tb-stabilized ceramics. Japan’s hydrogen strategy (10 Mt H₂/yr by 2030) will modestly increase Tb use ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=Another%20key%20driver%20is%20the,terbium%20demand%20for%20SOFC%20components)). Research applications (quantum computing, medical imaging) add minor demand. In total, US/allied Tb demand in 2030 is forecast on the order of **tens to possibly 100+ tonnes** per year, dominated by magnet and phosphor applications ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=and%20magnetic%20coercivity,is%20both%20high%20and%20structurally)) ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=%2A%2AElectronics%20and%20Displays%2A%2A%20Terbium,term%20stability%20hinges%20on%20the)).

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **MP Materials (USA)** – “Upstream 60K” expansion aims to raise Mountain Pass output to ~60,000 t/yr REO by 2027 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/articles/mp-materials-reports-third-quarter-2023-results#:~:text=Mountain%20Pass)).  At ~0.5% Tb content, this implies ~300 t Tb/yr **potential** (if fully processed).  However, to date only light REOs (Nd/Pr) have been separated on site; heavy-REE (Tb/Dy) are still mostly sent to Asia for separation.  By 2030 MP expects integrated separations and magnet production.  
• **Lynas Rare Earths (Australia/US)** – Lynas is doubling its processing. The Lynas NEXT program funds (with US DPA) a new cracking/leach plant in Kalgoorlie (WA) and a processing facility in Texas ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-track-establish-domestic-rare-earths-supply-chain-defence-official-says-2024-05-22/#:~:text=Laura%20Taylor,Despite%20increased%20production)).  These expansions will increase total REO output.  While Lynas’s current Mt Weld ore is largely LREE, the expanded throughput will proportionally raise byproduct HREE (Tb) recovery. A rough estimate: doubling from ~20 kt to ~40 kt REO would yield ~80–100 t Tb if 0.5% content.  
• **Northern Minerals (Browns Range, Australia)** – Final investment decision (Q1 2025) to mine and process an ion-adsorption clay rich in Dy and Tb. First production (target Q4 2027) will deliver a thick-media concentrate (~25% TREO ([northernminerals.com.au](https://northernminerals.com.au/browns-range-project/#:~:text=targeted%20Q1%202025%20First%20production,8%2B%20years))) enriched in heavy REE (Dy/Tb).  By 2030, Browns Range may contribute a few tonnes of Tb per year (pre-concentrate).  
• **Canada (Saskatchewan)** – SRC’s processing facility (see above) can toll-process REO to metal. By 2030, if feedstocks (e.g. Molycorp backlog) arrive, North America might refine mainland Nd/Pr internally. However, Tb output depends on future heavy-REE mines; none are active.  Canada also plans demonstration projects (e.g. Avalon Rare Earths Muskwa, 2020s drilling, but no production yet).  
• **Other Allied Projects** – Several pilot and planned projects may start by 2030: e.g. USA Rare Earth (Round Top, TX) aims to put low-grade RE clay into production mid-2020s (though limited Tb yield); Critical Minerals Colorado (CeRock) advancing a GE-based RE; nor yet Tb output. Recycling projects like Rare Earth Salts (NE Nebraska) will convert scrap to Tb oxide (first-year scale ~tons). Overall allied supply in 2030 is constrained by processing capacity. Even optimistic build-out (MP 60 kt + Lynas 40 kt + others) yields only ~100 kt total REO, so Tb (~0.5%) ~500 t spread among allies. Realistically, domestic supply by 2030 will likely be on the order of **hundreds of tonnes per year** at most, covering a fraction of demand.

No commercial Tb mine exists.  
• **Norway (Fen deposit)** – Rare Earths Norway reported the Fen carbonatite hosts the largest REE resource in continental Europe ([rareearthsnorway.com](https://rareearthsnorway.com/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-elements-discovered-at-fen-norway#:~:text=The%20Maiden%20Mineral%20Resource%20Estimate,for%20REN%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Europe)) (hypothetical Tb amount unmined).

China supplies ≈90% of this ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=predominantly%20extracted%20as%20a%20byproduct,Australia)), underscoring the small volume from US/allies.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Airborne Radiometric Surveys:**  Detect natural γ-emissions from U/Th-bearing minerals often associated with REE.  For example, eudialyte and other HREE-hosts contain Th/U and were successfully delineated by airborne radiometrics at the Jemi (Mexico) HREE prospect ([monumental.energy](https://monumental.energy/2022/05/monumental-minerals-corp-airborne-geophysical-survey-defines-8-km-prospective-radiometric-trend-and-conducts-site-visit-at-jemi-heavy-rare-earth-project-mexico/#:~:text=mineralization%20commonly%20contain%20trace%20Th,2014%2C%20Shives%202015)). Such surveys pinpoint anomalous γ-rays, flagging carbonatites or alkaline intrusives for follow-up.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:**  Traditional prospecting for carbonatites, alkaline complexes, or weathered REE-bearing bedrock. Detailed geological mapping (e.g. identifying calciocarbonatite outcrops or syenites) coupled with stream/soil geochemical sampling of Ce, La, Y, etc., reveals REE anomalies. This approach underpins discovery of deposits like Fen (Norway) or the Powderhorn (USA) REE-carbonatite.  
• **Airborne Hyperspectral & Multispectral Imaging:**  Modern sensors (e.g. AVIRIS) can detect REE-indicator minerals via characteristic spectral signatures.  Hyperspectral surveys identify minerals like bastnäsite, monazite, or fenite alteration.  For instance, NASA’s HyMap data have been used to map REE-rich clay and feldspathic zones (very advanced, emerging).  
• **Airborne Magnetics/Gravity:**  Many REE carbonatites have magnetic or density contrasts. Magnetometer surveys can outline carbonatite intrusions beneath cover (e.g. Peculiar Knob in Australia). Gravity surveys likewise detect dense carbonatites. These methods effectively narrow target areas.  
• **Ground Geophysics (DEM, MT, IP):**  EM and induced-polarization (IP) deep-look systems can sense clay-hosted REE zones or structural controls (e.g. faults controlling mineralization).  DC resistivity can delineate palaeo-placer layers (e.g. Browns Range ion-adsorption clays). These are applied in late-stage exploration.  
• **Drilling & Core Logging:**  Ultimately, diamond drilling confirms Tb ore. New techniques like downhole hyperspectral scanners and XRF cores expedite REE assay analysis. Cutting-edge approaches (machine learning on drill logs, detailed petrography) improve discrimination of REE-rich zones.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Mining & Beneficiation:**  Conventional open-pit or (rarely) underground mining. Ores are crushed, milled and concentrated.  For example, Northern Minerals’ Browns Range project will use heavy-media separation to upgrade ore to ~25% TREO ([northernminerals.com.au](https://northernminerals.com.au/browns-range-project/#:~:text=targeted%20Q1%202025%20First%20production,8%2B%20years)).  Mt. Weld’s processing uses ball milling and froth flotation to produce a REO-rich concentrate ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20ore%20at%20the%20concentration,where%20the%20concentrate%20is%20processed)) (serving as “bastnäsite concentrate” feedstock).  
• **Thermal Cracking (Sulfation):**  Many bastnäsite/cerium fluorocarbonates are thermally “cracked” with sulfuric acid or NaOH.  At Lynas (Malaysia), the shipped concentrate undergoes a sulfuric roasting (weak acid “crack”) step, converting fluorocarbonates into water-soluble sulfates ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20ore%20at%20the%20concentration,where%20the%20concentrate%20is%20processed)). This makes the REEs accessible to leaching.  
• **Acid Leaching:**  The cracked or raw ore is leached with acids (commonly H₂SO₄ or HCl) to dissolve REEs.  Lynas’ process uses relatively mild H₂SO₄ leach, while Mountain Pass historically used HCl leach. After leaching, the pulp is neutralized (e.g. with MgO/CaCO₃) to remove gangue elements, yielding a clear REE “pregnant liquor” ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20ore%20at%20the%20concentration,where%20the%20concentrate%20is%20processed)).  
• **Alkaline (Caustic) Leaching:**  Some ores (e.g. refractory ores or apatite-rich materials) undergo NaOH caustic roast. This converts REE to insoluble hydroxides which are then leached with water.  Australia’s Olympic Dam (a Cu–Au–REE deposit) uses such alkaline processing. In-situ leaching of clay deposits with weak acids (or alkali) is also practiced in China.  
• **Physical Separation (Magnetic/Gravity):**  In some cases, high-intensity magnetic separators or gravity concentrators remove iron/titanium gangue from REE ores.  For example, xenotime-bearing sands can be pre-concentrated magnetically. Such steps enhance downstream recovery, though are secondary to chemical extraction.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):**  The cornerstone of REE separation. Multistage counter-current liquid-liquid extraction (using organophosphorus, amine, or acidic extractants) separates the REEs from each other.  E.g., Lynas/Mt. Weld processes use SX trains to isolate Nd-Pr, Ce-La, Sm-Gd, and HREE (including Tb) fractions ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20concentrate%20undergoes%20cracking%20where,liquid%20extraction%20method)). SX achieves high purity but requires hundreds of stages and precise pH control.  
• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:**  Column chromatography with cation-exchange resins (e.g. sulfonated polystyrene) can fractionate lighter from heavier REEs, especially HREEs like Tb and Dy. This was used industrially in the former Soviet SOP (ternary) process. Experimental continuous columns or batch recycling can achieve separations with less organic waste than SX.  
• **Liquid Membranes & Novel Resins:**  Emerging technologies use polymer inclusion membranes or ionic-liquid impregnated membranes to selectively shuttle specific REEs.  These have been trialed in labs for Tb/Dy separation but are not yet commercial at scale.  
• **Mixed-Media & Hybrid Systems:**  Combining SX with solids (e.g. resin-in-pulp, REE precipitation) can increase recovery. For example, selective precipitation of cerium or phosphate removal prior to SX is sometimes employed.  
• **Crystallization/Precipitation:**  After SX, purified REE solutions can be crystallized or precipitated to separate very similar ions (e.g. Pr from Nd using slight differences in solubility) and to produce final oxides (via double sulfate or hydroxide precipitation).  These steps “polish” the product after bulk separation.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Precipitation & Calcination:**  Purified REE solutions are often precipitated (e.g. as oxalates or carbonates) and calcinated to form high-purity REE oxides.  Subsequent chemical conversions (e.g. oxide to fluoride or chloride) prepare material for metal production.  
• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:**  Analogous to aluminum smelting, deep-ultraviolet electrolysis of molten REE chlorides (often mixed with alkali chlorides) can produce metallic Tb directly.  This method is at pilot scale (e.g. MIT TRUMP process). It yields high-purity metal but is energy-intensive.  
• **Metallothermic Reduction:**  Solid-state reduction of Tb₂O₃ with calcium or aluminum (in a sealed vessel) can produce Tb metal or alloy.  The residue (e.g. CaO slag) is then leached away. This Kroll-like process was used at Idaho’s Experimental Station (and in Chinese hydrometallurgy for Sm–Dy metals).  
• **Hydrogen Decrepitation & Sintering:**  For NdFeB magnet production from Tb-containing alloys, H₂ can be used to refine and sitten metals (not for Tb metal itself).  
• **Vacuum Distillation/Zone-Refining:**  To achieve ultra-high-purity Tb, vacuum distillation (leveraging Tb’s vapor pressure) can remove volatile impurities.  Zone refining of Tb bars (melting a small zone along the metal bar) can further eliminate residual contaminants, yielding 99.99+% Tb metal. These are niche methods (used for extremely high-purity materials).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Lime/Alkali Neutralization:**  Acidic mine waters and tailings (often with dissolved REE) are neutralized by adding caustic agents (lime, NaOH, or alkaline ash). This raises pH, precipitating REE hydroxides (and Fe/Mn oxyhydroxides). The metal-laden precipitate can be settled out or back-extracted for REEs. Controlled pH raises ensure co-precipitation of Th/U if present.  
• **Constructed Wetlands & Bioreactors:**  Engineered wetlands use plants (e.g. Phragmites, algae) and microbial mats to gradually remove metals and acidity. For example, wetlands with sulfate-reducing bacteria can precipitate REEs as phosphates or sulfides. These passive systems treat diffuse drainage long-term with low operational cost, albeit more slowly.  
• **Sequential Precipitation & Recovery:**  Advanced schemes recover REEs from effluents. One example: raising pH with NaOH to precipitate Fe/Al, then adding oxalic acid to precipitate REE oxalates ([onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wer.1178#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20elements%20were%20recovered,process%20and%20the%20concentration%20of)). Such staged precipitation can isolate Tb and other REEs, yielding ~94% pure RE carbonate solids ([onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wer.1178#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20elements%20were%20recovered,process%20and%20the%20concentration%20of)). The concentrated solid can then be processed like an ore.  
• **Tailings Reprocessing & Solidification:**  Old REE tailings may still contain recoverable Tb. Re-milling and re-leaching tailings can capture remaining REEs, while remediating the waste. Alternatively, tailings can be stabilized (cemented or phosphated) to immobilize residual toxins.  Dry-stack and lined storage with capping minimize leachate.  
• **Ion Exchange/Adsorption:**  Reactive FGD gypsum or synthetic ion-exchangers (e.g. layered double hydroxides) have been tested to capture dissolved REEs from water, either in passive beds or flow-through columns. These adsorbents concentrate REEs which are later eluted by acid for recovery.  
• **High-Pressure Oxidation:**  Ozone or oxygen-enriched treatment can degrade organic contaminants and oxidize metals in effluent, facilitating subsequent pH adjustment and precipitation. This ensures any liberated Tb is caught as a solid.  

## References for mining technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:**  REE minerals (especially HREE-bearing eudialyte or xenotime) often contain trace Th/U.  Airborne radiometric surveys pick up γ-ray anomalies over such rocks ([monumental.energy](https://monumental.energy/2022/05/monumental-minerals-corp-airborne-geophysical-survey-defines-8-km-prospective-radiometric-trend-and-conducts-site-visit-at-jemi-heavy-rare-earth-project-mexico/#:~:text=mineralization%20commonly%20contain%20trace%20Th,2014%2C%20Shives%202015)), making them a proven tool (used successfully at the Jemi HREE project).  
• **Conventional Beneficiation:**  Crushing, grinding and flotation produce high-REE concentrates.  For instance, Browns Range ore is upgraded to ~25% TREO concentrate by gravity/float ([northernminerals.com.au](https://northernminerals.com.au/browns-range-project/#:~:text=targeted%20Q1%202025%20First%20production,8%2B%20years)); Mt. Weld produces similar bastnäsite concentrates via ball milling/flotation ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20ore%20at%20the%20concentration,where%20the%20concentrate%20is%20processed)).  
• **Cracking & Leaching:**  Sulfation (roasting with H₂SO₄) and acid leaching dissolve RE into solution.  Lynas’s plant “cracks” bastnäsite concentrate and leaches with weak acid ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20ore%20at%20the%20concentration,where%20the%20concentrate%20is%20processed)). Neutralization with MgO/CaCO₃ follows to remove impurities, yielding a REE feed solution for SX.  
• **Solvent Extraction:**  Multi-stage solvent extraction separates bulk RE groups.  Organic extractants are contacted with the leach solution to selectively transfer Nd-Pr, Sm-Gd, Dy-Tb, etc ([www.nsenergybusiness.com](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/mt-weld-rare-earths-mine/#:~:text=The%20concentrate%20undergoes%20cracking%20where,liquid%20extraction%20method)). This technique purifies REEs to >99% oxides in each group.  
• **Precipitation Methods:**  Advanced precipitation schemes have been demonstrated.  For example, treating acid mine drainage sequentially with NaOH (to precipitate Fe/Al) and then oxalic acid (to precipitate REEs) yields >94% pure REE solid ([onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wer.1178#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20elements%20were%20recovered,process%20and%20the%20concentration%20of)). Such methods can be integrated into AMD treatment to recover Tb and allied REEs.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Heavy-REE Separation:**  The lack of dedicated heavy-REE refining in the West is a critical bottleneck. Currently only a few facilities outside China (e.g. Estonia’s Silmet, Japan’s Niihama, Malaysia’s LAMP) can separate HREEs; none operate at full commercial scale for Tb ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20factors%20amplify%20risks,at%20commercial%20scale%20for%20terbium)). This means even if ore is mined, isolating Tb oxide domestically is difficult.  
• **Ore Grade & Recovery:**  Terbium’s natural abundance is extremely low (typically <1% of TREO ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense))). Recovering meaningful Tb quantities requires processing enormous ore/solution volumes. Existing processing equipment (designed for LREEs) may not efficiently capture such minor components, reducing economic yield.  
• **Refinement to Metal:**  Even if Tb₂O₇ oxide is secured, further reduction to metal is non-trivial.  The absence of domestic molten-salt electrolysis or Ca-reduction plants for Tb means reliance on Chinese refining or nascent US pilot facilities. Lack of Tb refiners limits the “allies” from producing end-product Tb metal or magnets.  
• **Recycling & Secondary Sources:**  Current recycling technology for Tb is rudimentary (<3% recovery ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=Terbium%20prices%20fluctuated%20between%20%241%2C800%2Fkg,terbium%20supply%20deficit%20by%202030))). Developing economically viable urban mining (e.g. from old magnets, lamps) is a bottleneck. Without efficient secondary sourcing, new mining must supply nearly all Tb demand.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The predominant bottleneck is **heavy rare-earth processing**: US/allies lack large-scale solvent-extraction/refinery facilities for Tb, which is currently a by-product available mostly in China ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20factors%20amplify%20risks,at%20commercial%20scale%20for%20terbium)).  Combined with Tb’s very low ore concentration (<1% of REO ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense))), this means domestic output stays small.  In practice, even ramped-up mining (MP, Lynas, Browns) yields mostly LREEs, and the technological gap in separating and reducing Tb remains the critical constraint on allied supply.  Improving or building Western heavy-REE separation and metalization technology is essential to close the U.S./allied Tb deficit ([pmarketresearch.com](https://pmarketresearch.com/chemi/terbium-metal-market/#:~:text=Geopolitical%20factors%20amplify%20risks,at%20commercial%20scale%20for%20terbium)) ([www.defense.gov](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3898948/department-of-defense-awards-422-million-to-increase-production-of-terbium-and/#:~:text=Terbium%20adds%20temperature%20resiliency%20to,in%20commercial%20industry%20and%20defense)).
