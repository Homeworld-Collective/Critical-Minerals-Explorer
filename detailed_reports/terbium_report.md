## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Heavy-REE separation capacity; metallurgical refinement; low ore grades*

The predominant bottleneck is **heavy rare-earth separation and refining capacity**: US/allies lack large-scale solvent-extraction facilities specifically designed for separating heavy rare earths like terbium, which currently requires hundreds of extraction stages and is performed almost exclusively in China. Combined with terbium's extremely low concentration in ore (typically 0.01-0.05% of total rare earth content, or <0.01% of raw ore), this means even expanded mining operations yield minimal terbium. The technological gap in both separating terbium from other heavy rare earths (particularly dysprosium) and reducing terbium oxide to metal remains the critical constraint. Additionally, the absence of domestic metallurgical facilities for producing high-purity terbium metal (via molten salt electrolysis or metallothermic reduction) forces reliance on Chinese processing. Without building Western heavy-REE separation plants with 200+ stage solvent extraction circuits and metal refineries, the US/allied terbium deficit will persist regardless of mining expansion.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: <5 tons Tb/year actual production*

• **United States** – MP Materials operates the only active REE mine at Mountain Pass, California. In 2023, MP produced approximately 43,000 tons of rare earth concentrate (containing ~15,000 tons REO equivalent). However, Mountain Pass ore contains primarily light rare earths with minimal terbium content (<0.01% of total REE). While MP ships concentrate for processing, actual separated terbium production is effectively zero domestically, as the US lacks heavy-REE separation facilities. The Department of Defense has funded initiatives to develop domestic terbium production capacity, but commercial-scale output remains absent.

• **Australia** – Lynas Rare Earths operates the Mt. Weld mine in Western Australia, producing approximately 23,000 tons of REO annually (2023 data). Mt. Weld ore is predominantly light rare earth elements (La, Ce, Nd, Pr) with terbium representing <0.02% of total REE content. Lynas processes ore at its Malaysian plant (LAMP) where some heavy-REE separation occurs, yielding an estimated 1-3 tons of terbium oxide annually. Northern Minerals' Browns Range project remains in development, with pilot plant operations producing small quantities of dysprosium-terbium concentrate but no commercial terbium separation.

• **Canada** – No commercial terbium production exists. The Saskatchewan Research Council operates a rare earth processing facility producing neodymium-praseodymium metals (10 tons/month scaling to 40 tons/month) but does not separate heavy rare earths including terbium. Several exploration projects exist but none are producing.

• **Europe (EU/UK/Norway)** – Zero domestic terbium production. While significant rare earth deposits exist (e.g., Fen carbonatite in Norway, Norra Kärr in Sweden), none are in production. The EU relies entirely on imports, primarily from China, for terbium supply. Some processing capacity exists (e.g., Solvay's La Rochelle plant) but handles imported materials only.

• **Japan** – No domestic terbium mining or primary production. Japan maintains some separation capacity for imported rare earth materials but produces no primary terbium.

Current global terbium oxide production is estimated at 200-300 tons annually, with China controlling approximately 95% of separated terbium production. US and allied production combined represents less than 5 tons of separated terbium oxide per year.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 150-200 tons Tb oxide/year by 2030*

• **Permanent Magnets (EVs, Wind, Motors):** Terbium is added to neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets at 0.5-2% by weight to improve high-temperature coercivity. A typical EV traction motor contains 1-2 kg of NdFeB magnets with 10-20 grams of terbium. Wind turbine generators (3 MW direct-drive) use 600-800 kg of NdFeB magnets containing 6-12 kg of terbium. With projected US/allied EV production of 15-20 million vehicles by 2030 and 150 GW of new wind capacity, terbium demand from magnets alone could reach 100-150 tons annually.

• **Electronics & Lighting (Phosphors/Displays):** Terbium-activated phosphors produce green emission in fluorescent lamps, LEDs, and displays. While LED adoption reduces per-unit terbium use, growing display sizes and specialty lighting applications maintain demand. Allied demand estimated at 20-30 tons annually by 2030.

• **Defense & Aerospace:** Terbium is critical for military applications including sonar systems, precision-guided munitions, and naval propulsion systems. While tonnage is modest (5-10 tons annually), this demand is strategically critical and inelastic. The US Department of Defense has identified terbium as a critical material for national security.

• **Other High-Tech Uses:** Emerging applications in solid oxide fuel cells, magnetostrictive devices (Terfenol-D alloys), and specialized sensors add 5-10 tons annual demand. Total US/allied terbium demand by 2030 is projected at 150-200 tons of terbium oxide annually, representing a 10-15% annual growth rate from current consumption levels.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 20-40 tons Tb oxide/year projected*

• **MP Materials (USA)** – The "Upstream 60K" expansion aims to achieve 60,000 tons/year REO production by 2027-2028. Given Mountain Pass ore composition (terbium <0.01% of REE content), maximum theoretical terbium content would be 6 tons annually if fully separated domestically. However, MP's planned separation facility focuses on light rare earths (Nd/Pr), with heavy-REE separation remaining uncertain. Realistic terbium production: 0-2 tons by 2030.

• **Lynas Rare Earths (Australia/Malaysia/US)** – Expansion plans target 40,000 tons REO annually by 2030 through Mt. Weld production increases and new processing facilities in Australia (Kalgoorlie) and Texas. With terbium at ~0.02% of Mt. Weld REE content, theoretical maximum is 8 tons terbium oxide annually. Actual separated production likely 3-5 tons given processing constraints.

• **Northern Minerals (Browns Range, Australia)** – Targeting commercial production by 2028-2029, Browns Range contains higher heavy-REE content including terbium (0.1-0.2% of TREO). Initial production target of 3,000 tons TREO annually could yield 3-6 tons terbium oxide if separation capacity exists.

• **Canada** – No terbium production expected by 2030. While several projects are in exploration/development, none target heavy rare earths as primary products.

• **Other Allied Projects** – USA Rare Earth (Round Top, Texas) and other development projects may contribute minimal amounts, but lack of heavy-REE separation infrastructure limits actual terbium recovery. Combined contribution: <5 tons.

Total realistic allied terbium oxide supply by 2030: 20-40 tons annually, covering only 10-25% of projected demand.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
The critical bottleneck for US/allied terbium production is the absence of commercial-scale heavy rare-earth separation facilities capable of isolating terbium from other heavy REEs, requiring 200+ solvent extraction stages with specialized extractants. This is compounded by terbium's extremely low concentration in ore (<0.02% of total REE content), necessitating massive throughput for meaningful production. Additionally, the lack of domestic metallurgical capacity for converting terbium oxide to high-purity metal creates complete dependence on Chinese processing. Building integrated heavy-REE separation plants with metallurgical refineries represents a multi-billion dollar investment with 5-7 year development timelines.
