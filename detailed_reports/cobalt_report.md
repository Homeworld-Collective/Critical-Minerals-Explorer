## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Refining capacity; economic viability; permitting delays*

• **Refining/Processing Capacity**: The dominant bottleneck is lack of indigenous cobalt refining. Even if mines produce ore, allied nations lack facilities to convert Co into battery-grade chemicals. China currently dominates cobalt refining (processing ~70% of global cobalt into chemicals). The U.S. has essentially no primary refining plants, forcing raw Co to be shipped abroad. This creates vulnerability: the U.S. has considered but not acted on stockpiling cobalt due to China's stranglehold on processing. Without significant new refinery investment (hydrometallurgy or recycling plants), domestic/ally supply cannot scale.

• **Economic Competitiveness (Market Pricing)**: Low cobalt prices (from DRC/Indonesia oversupply and increasing LFP battery adoption) have stalled new mines. Jervois' Idaho project was suspended in 2023 when cobalt prices fell below $15/lb. Allied mining technology is ready (Idaho mine constructed, HPAL proven), but market viability and financing remain bottlenecks. This is a techno-economic issue: extraction and processing equipment exists, but capital flows depend on prices and policy support. Cheap imports have "hindered development of independent Western cobalt supply chains."

• **Permitting and Infrastructure**: Developing new cobalt sources is slowed by lengthy permitting and lack of infrastructure. Advanced mining and processing projects require 10-15 years to move from discovery to production in Western jurisdictions. This delay represents a regulatory and infrastructure bottleneck. For example, even with identified Co resources (like in Finland or Alaska), it takes many years for feasibility studies, environmental impact assessments, and construction to implement extraction.

**Key Bottleneck Summary**: The critical bottleneck for US/allied cobalt supply is downstream processing capacity and economics. China's dominance of cobalt refining means allied mines have limited domestic processing options, forcing reliance on external processors. Coupled with depressed metal prices and long development timelines, this has kept new projects offline. The technology to extract cobalt exists, but lack of in-country refining capacity and challenging market conditions hamper sovereign supply chain development.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~8,100 tons/year (Canada 4,500; Australia 3,600; Finland ~1,100; US, Japan, Norway near zero)*

• **United States**: ~0 t/yr currently. The Idaho Cobalt Operations (Jervois Global) is the only primary cobalt project in the U.S., with planned capacity of ~2,000 t/yr cobalt in concentrate. However, operations were suspended in March 2023 due to low cobalt prices and remain on care and maintenance. No other active cobalt mines exist in the U.S., aside from negligible byproducts from copper operations. Jervois is seeking to resume Idaho production when market conditions improve.

• **Canada**: ~4,500 t/yr (2024). Canada's cobalt is recovered as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, and Newfoundland/Labrador (e.g., Sudbury, Voisey's Bay, Thompson operations). Key companies include Vale (Sudbury), Glencore (Raglan, Sudbury), and Sherritt International (which processes Cuban laterite ore at its Fort Saskatchewan refinery in Alberta).

• **Australia**: ~3,600 t/yr (2024), down from ~4,600 t/yr (2023). Cobalt is mainly obtained as a byproduct of Western Australian nickel mining (e.g., Glencore's Murrin Murrin, BHP's former Mount Keith, IGO's Nova operations). The 2023 peak came from increased nickel sulfide operations, but recent nickel market oversupply and mine closures pushed cobalt output down in 2024. Australia holds ~1.7 Mt Co reserves and continues exploration.

• **European Union (Finland)**: ~1,100 t/yr (2021-2022 average). Finland hosts the only significant cobalt production in Europe – Boliden's Kevitsa Ni-Cu mine and Terrafame's Sotkamo Ni-Zn-Co mine (both producing Co as a byproduct). These operations combined for approximately 1,100 t in recent years. Other EU countries have no significant Co mining, making Finland's output the entirety of EU production. Finland's known Co resources are the largest in Europe, but current output remains limited relative to demand.

• **Norway & Iceland**: Essentially zero currently. Norway has historic cobalt occurrences but no modern cobalt extraction from domestic sources. Norway's role in cobalt supply comes from refining imported materials (particularly at Glencore's Nikkelverk refinery). Iceland has no cobalt mining or production.

• **Japan**: 0 t/yr (no mines). Japan has no domestic cobalt resources and is 100% import-dependent. It hosts refining plants (e.g., Sumitomo Metal Mining) and recovers some Co from scrap, but its entire primary cobalt needs are met by imports.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 80,000-120,000 tons/year estimated*

• **EV batteries**: By 2030, cobalt demand will be dominated by lithium-ion EV batteries. EVs are expected to account for ~57% of global cobalt use by 2030. With global demand projected at ~400,000 t by the early 2030s, roughly 228,000 t would be for batteries globally. U.S. and allied EV adoption targets suggest 40,000-70,000 t could be consumed by 2030 (assuming the US, EU, Japan, and other allies collectively produce 8-10 million EVs annually, at 5-8 kg Co per vehicle average, accounting for increasing low-cobalt and cobalt-free chemistries). The EU's Critical Raw Materials Act and the US Inflation Reduction Act are both driving EV growth with domestic content requirements.

• **Aerospace & Defense (superalloys)**: A significant portion of cobalt is used in high-temperature superalloys for aircraft engines, gas turbines, and military hardware. Historically, ~20% of Western cobalt consumption has gone into superalloys. The U.S. Department of Defense and aerospace industry (e.g., Pratt & Whitney, GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce) require high-purity Co. By 2030, continued aircraft production and military modernization could demand 15,000-20,000 t of cobalt in this sector among US/allies.

• **Other battery/industrial uses**: Beyond EVs, cobalt remains important in consumer electronics batteries, energy storage systems, and traditional applications. Cobalt catalysts (petroleum refining, chemical synthesis), magnetic alloys, and chemical compounds (pigments, driers) consume additional supply. These other uses might add another 15,000-25,000 t/yr by 2030 across US/allies.

• **Total estimated demand**: Summing sectors above: approximately 80,000-120,000 t/yr by 2030 for US and allies combined. Europe and Japan are already heavily import-dependent; domestic recycling and scrap currently cover only 5-10% of demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 25,000-35,000 tons/year projected*

• **Mining output**: Even with proposed new projects, allied mining will supply only a small fraction of 2030 demand. The Idaho mine may restart at ~2,000 t/yr if prices recover. Canada has several planned projects (e.g., NICO deposit, additional Voisey's Bay development) that might add 2,000-3,000 tonnes by late 2020s. Australia's production could stabilize at ~4,000-5,000 t/yr if nickel demand improves. The EU aims to mine 10% of its cobalt needs by 2030 under the Critical Raw Materials Act, though no new mines are currently under construction. In practice, allied mining supply will likely remain approximately 15,000-20,000 t/yr by 2030.

• **Processing/refining capacity**: Supply also depends on refining capacity. Europe is investing in new processing: France's planned refinery in Bordeaux aims to process ~1,500 t/yr of cobalt starting ~2028. The EU's Critical Raw Materials Act targets processing 40% of its critical materials by 2030. In the U.S., there is currently no primary cobalt refining, though Electra Battery Materials is developing a refinery in Ontario, Canada that could serve North American markets. Japan and Norway maintain some refining of imported cobalt, but domestic processing in allied countries remains limited.

• **Recycling and waste recovery**: By 2030, allied recycling could provide modest relief. Europe projects battery recycling capacity that could recover 3,000-5,000 tonnes of Co annually. The U.S. and Japan are also ramping battery recycling (companies like Redwood Materials, Li-Cycle), potentially adding another 3,000-5,000 t/yr combined. However, true circularity remains limited by collection rates and technical challenges.

• **Overall supply vs. demand gap**: Summing the above, U.S./allied mines, refineries, and recycling might supply 25,000-35,000 t/yr by 2030, whereas demand could exceed 100,000 t. This implies a structural shortfall of 65,000-75,000 tons annually, necessitating large imports from the DRC, Indonesia, or Chinese-controlled supply chains.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Geophysical surveys (magnetic/EM); geochemical sampling; radiometric surveys; machine learning integration; 3D drilling/imaging*

• **Geophysical Surveys (Magnetic/EM)**: Cobalt is often hosted in nickel-copper-cobalt sulfide deposits. Ground and airborne magnetic and electromagnetic surveys can map these sulfide zones. For instance, geophysics campaigns at Idaho's Iron Creek deposit have identified new cobalt-copper targets. Geophysical methods (ground EM, induced polarization, magnetics) are effective for uncovering buried sulfide bodies.

• **Geochemical Sampling & Mapping**: Stream-sediment and soil geochemistry targeting cobalt and pathfinders (Ni, Cu, As) is fundamental. Mapping alteration zones (e.g., ultramafic/mafic intrusions or skarns) helps narrow search areas. Projects in Canada and Australia routinely sample regolith for Co anomalies near known Ni deposits. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can detect specific alteration minerals (serpentine, chlorite) associated with cobaltiferous orebodies.

• **Radiometric Surveys**: Cobalt deposits can sometimes correlate with uranium/thorium anomalies. Airborne radiometric surveys (measuring gamma rays) may highlight mineralized zones. In some cases, deposits containing cobalt minerals (cobaltite, skutterudite) also show elevated U/Th. Integrating radiometric data with geology can flag prospective zones.

• **Machine Learning & Data Integration**: Modern AI/ML techniques integrate geological, geochemical, remote sensing and drilling datasets to predict hidden cobalt deposits. Spatial analytics identify subtle patterns across mining regions. These advanced analytics complement traditional prospecting by prioritizing targets for follow-up. Pattern recognition has been used in the Canadian Shield to highlight Ni-Co belt anomalies.

• **Drilling & 3D Imaging**: Core drilling confirms Co-rich ore. New techniques include downhole geophysics and 3D geological modeling from drill data to refine orebody geometries. These drilling results feed into resource models to estimate Co tonnage and grade distribution.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Sulfide flotation; pressure acid leaching (HPAL); ammoniacal leaching; bio-oxidation (R&D); roasting/calcination*

• **Sulfide Ore Processing (Flotation)**: Most primary cobalt from sulfide ores is recovered by flotation of copper-nickel sulfide ores. After crushing and milling, flotation produces a copper-nickel-cobalt concentrate (e.g., at Canada's Raglan or Finland's Kevitsa). Similar methods apply to any sulfide Ni-Cu-Co orebodies.

• **Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL)**: Cobalt-bearing laterite ores are processed by high-pressure, high-temperature sulfuric acid leach. This HPAL method dissolves nickel and cobalt into solution. Indonesia's HPAL plants collectively process nickel laterite to produce mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) containing Co. While allied nations lack domestic HPAL plants for laterites, this technology is critical globally for Co extraction.

• **Ammoniacal or Alkaline Leaching**: Some projects use ammonia-based leaches on oxide ores or mixed sulfide-oxide ores. For low-grade Co tailings or refractory ores, alkaline solutions can preferentially dissolve cobalt and nickel. This method offers lower temperature operation than HPAL.

• **Bio-oxidation / Heap Leaching (R&D)**: Certain bacteria can oxidize nickel sulfide tailings, freeing cobalt. Pilot studies have tested bio-leaching of low-grade Ni-Co ores, but this remains experimental. Heap leaching of cobaltiferous waste using weak acid is under investigation for tailings reprocessing.

• **Roasting / Calcination**: Cobalt concentrates or intermediate hydroxides undergo thermal treatment. Roasting Ni-Co hydroxide precipitate at 400-600°C drives off water and converts hydroxides to oxides. This oxide is then used in subsequent refinement steps.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction (SX); ion exchange; precipitation/crystallization; electrowinning*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX)**: Widely used to separate Co from Ni, Cu, and Fe in leach solutions. Common extractants (e.g., Cyanex 272, D2EHPA) selectively bind Co²⁺ at controlled pH. After HPAL of laterite, cobalt is extracted and stripped to produce purified Co sulfate solution. SX is employed at hydrometallurgical plants to purify nickel liquor and recover cobalt chemicals.

• **Ion Exchange (IX) / Adsorption**: Ion-exchange resins (chelating resins or activated carbon) selectively capture Co²⁺ from solution. Battery recycling facilities use IX columns to remove cobalt and nickel from leachates before electrowinning. Fixed-bed ion exchangers are used for solution polishing in refineries.

• **Precipitation and Crystallization**: Cobalt can be precipitated from solution as hydroxide or carbonate by pH adjustment. Cobalt sulfate (CoSO₄·7H₂O) can be crystallized by concentrating sulfate solutions through evaporation. These solid products are intermediate steps requiring further refining to battery-grade purity.

• **Electrowinning / Electro-refining**: Cobalt is recovered by electrowinning from purified sulfate solutions, yielding cobalt metal cathodes. Alternatively, cobalt sulfate solutions may be purified and sold directly for battery precursor production. Electrowinning typically operates at current densities of 200-400 A/m².

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Chemical purification to battery-grade; electrowinning to metal; battery-salt synthesis; electrochemical recycling*

• **Chemical Purification of Cobalt Sulfate**: After SX/IX, cobalt is refined to battery-grade chemicals (>99.5% purity). Processes use multiple stages of solvent extraction and crystallization. Precise pH and redox control ensures removal of trace impurities (Fe, Ni, Cu, Mn, Zn) to meet battery specifications (<10 ppm each impurity).

• **Metal Production (Electrowinning/Reduction)**: Cobalt metal is produced by electrolytic reduction or thermal reduction of oxides. Purified Co sulfate solution is electrolyzed to plate metallic cobalt cathodes (99.8% purity). Alternatively, cobalt oxide is reduced with hydrogen or carbon to produce metal powder for superalloys.

• **Battery-Salt Synthesis**: For EV markets, cobalt is delivered as cobalt sulfate heptahydrate (CoSO₄·7H₂O) or hydroxide. Modern refiners ensure correct hydration state and purity for Li-ion cathode production. Technologies include crystallizers, centrifuges, and fluid-bed dryers to achieve consistent product quality.

• **Electrochemical Recovery (Recycling)**: Advanced recycling processes spent Li-ion cathodes via hydrometallurgy then purifies back to cobalt salts. Direct recycling methods aim to recover cathode materials without breaking down to elements. Electrochemical cells and membrane separation are being developed for selective Co recovery with minimal reagents.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Neutralization/precipitation; phytoremediation; adsorption/filtration; tailings containment*

• **Neutralization and Precipitation**: Mining wastewater is treated by neutralizing acidity with lime or limestone, causing heavy metals including Co²⁺ to precipitate as hydroxides or carbonates. Passive systems (constructed wetlands, limestone drains) remove Co from acid mine drainage. Lime neutralization is standard at nickel mines to capture cobalt in treatment sludge.

• **Phytoremediation and Bioaccumulation**: Metal-tolerant plants (nickel hyperaccumulators) can uptake trace cobalt from contaminated soils or tailings. Field trials use species like *Alyssum murale* or *Berkheya coddii* to remediate metal-contaminated sites. Harvested biomass can be processed to recover accumulated metals.

• **Adsorption/Filtration Solutions**: Activated carbon, zeolites, or ion-exchange media scrub cobalt from process waters. Engineered adsorbents trap Co²⁺ with high selectivity. Such systems treat wastewater streams from refining plants, allowing Co recovery from spent media through regeneration.

• **Tailings Capping and Containment**: Modern cobalt projects employ engineered tailings storage facilities with composite liners and covers to prevent leaching. Cover systems (clay, geomembranes, vegetation) limit oxygen ingress and acid generation. Monitoring wells and water treatment plants are standard. Dry-stacking or paste tailings reduce water contact and environmental risk.
