## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States**: ~10,400 t/yr (metal content). The only U.S. primary cobalt mine is the Idaho Cobalt Project (Jervois Global) ([jervoisglobal.com](https://jervoisglobal.com/projects/idaho-cobalt-operations/#:~:text=ICO%20is%20the%20only%20primary,to%20the%20low%20carbon%20economy)), which has been completed but is currently suspended due to low cobalt prices ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-cobalt-miner-trump-use-tariffs-scalpel-not-sledgehammer-2024-12-11/#:~:text=markets%20with%20cheap%20cobalt%2C%20often,for%20electric%20vehicle%20batteries%20and)). Historically, this single deposit (Salmon, Idaho) would have supplied the bulk of U.S. cobalt. No other active cobalt mines exist in the U.S., aside from negligible byproducts. (Jervois is seeking to resume Idaho production when market conditions improve ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-cobalt-miner-trump-use-tariffs-scalpel-not-sledgehammer-2024-12-11/#:~:text=markets%20with%20cheap%20cobalt%2C%20often,for%20electric%20vehicle%20batteries%20and)) ([jervoisglobal.com](https://jervoisglobal.com/projects/idaho-cobalt-operations/#:~:text=ICO%20is%20the%20only%20primary,to%20the%20low%20carbon%20economy)).)  
• **Canada**: ~4,500 t/yr (2024) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-cobalt-producers-country-updated-2024#:~:text=Canada%20produced%204%2C500%20MT%20of,230%2C000%20MT%20of%20cobalt%20reserves)).  Canada’s cobalt is recovered as a byproduct from nickel and copper mining in Ontario, Québec, Manitoba, and Newfoundland/Labrador (e.g. Sudbury, Voisey’s Bay, Thompson, and Cobalt Camp). Key companies include Glencore in Sudbury/Nickel Rim South and Sherritt in Cuba (with Canadian headquarter) – all feeding into refined Co output. Natural Resources Canada reports 4.5 kt of mine-supply in 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-cobalt-producers-country-updated-2024#:~:text=Canada%20produced%204%2C500%20MT%20of,230%2C000%20MT%20of%20cobalt%20reserves)) (plus additional secondary from recycling).  
• **Australia**: ~4,600 t/yr (2023) ([elements.visualcapitalist.com](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-cobalt-production-by-country-in-2023/#:~:text=Country%20%20,9.00)) (down to ~3,600 t in 2024) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-cobalt-producers-country-updated-2024#:~:text=Australia%E2%80%99s%20annual%20cobalt%20production%20fell,7%20million%20MT)). Cobalt is mainly obtained as a byproduct of Western Australian nickel mining (e.g. Glencore’s Murrin Murrin, BHP’s Mount Keith, IGO’s Leinster operations).  The 2023 figure (4,600 t) came largely from increased nickel sulfide operations ([elements.visualcapitalist.com](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-cobalt-production-by-country-in-2023/#:~:text=Country%20%20,9.00)), although recent oversupply pushed cobalt output down to ~3,600 t in 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-cobalt-producers-country-updated-2024#:~:text=Australia%E2%80%99s%20annual%20cobalt%20production%20fell,7%20million%20MT)).  Australia holds ~1.7 Mt Co reserves ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-cobalt-producers-country-updated-2024#:~:text=Australia%E2%80%99s%20annual%20cobalt%20production%20fell,7%20million%20MT)) and continues exploration (e.g. the Cobalt Blue nickel–cobalt deposit in NSW).  
• **European Union (Finland)**: ~1,100 t/yr (2021) ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=two%20mines%20are%20extracting%20cobalt,of%20the%20known%20global%20cobalt)).  Finland hosts the only primary cobalt mines in Europe – Boliden’s Kevitsa Ni–Cu mine and Terrafame’s Sotkamo Ni–Zn mine (both producing Co as a byproduct). These two operations combined for about 1,084 t in 2021 (Kevitsa ~592 t) ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=two%20mines%20are%20extracting%20cobalt,of%20the%20known%20global%20cobalt)). Other EU countries (and allies Norway/Iceland) have no significant Co mining today, so the rest of EU’s production is effectively zero to negligible. Finland’s known Co resources are the largest in Europe ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=Finland%20has%20a%20significant%20role,of%20the%20country%27s%20demand%2C%20as)), but irrational development means current output is orders of magnitude below demand.  
• **Norway & Iceland**: Essentially zero currently. Norway has historic cobalt occurrences (e.g. Koitelainen, Skuterud) but no modern cobalt extraction. Norwegian supply comes mostly from recycled material and byproduct (e.g. No nickel-cobalt projects are in production), though Norway’s cobalt compounds (from bauxite or Ni refining) have been significant for exports. Iceland has no cobalt mining or production. Notably, Norway and Japan were identified as “top U.S. suppliers” of cobalt in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cobalt-produced-by-chinas-lygend-indonesia-skirts-trump-tariffs-2025-03-17/#:~:text=Congo%27s%20temporary%20suspension%20of%20cobalt,suppliers%20last%20year)), reflecting their roles as refining/re-export centers (rather than new mining).  
• **Japan**: 0 t/yr (no mines). Japan has no domestic cobalt resources and is 100% import-dependent.  It hosts refining plants (e.g. Toho Zinc) and recovers some Co from scrap, but today its entire cobalt needs (for electronics, NiMH batteries, etc.) are met by imports (often from allied producers like Canada or Norway) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/cobalt-produced-by-chinas-lygend-indonesia-skirts-trump-tariffs-2025-03-17/#:~:text=Congo%27s%20temporary%20suspension%20of%20cobalt,suppliers%20last%20year)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **EV batteries**:  By 2030, cobalt demand will be dominated by lithium-ion EV batteries.  EVs are expected to account for ~57% of global cobalt use by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-cobalt-market-seen-swinging-deficit-surplus-early-2030s-2025-05-14/#:~:text=from%20the%20electric%20vehicle%20,to%20222%2C000%20tons%20in%202024)).  With global demand projected ~400,000 t by the early 2030s ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-cobalt-market-seen-swinging-deficit-surplus-early-2030s-2025-05-14/#:~:text=from%20the%20electric%20vehicle%20,to%20222%2C000%20tons%20in%202024)), roughly 228,000 t would be for batteries.  U.S. and allied EV adoption targets suggest on the order of 50,000–150,000 t could be consumed by 2030 (for example, if the US and EU each build millions of EVs annually, at 8–15 kg Co per vehicle). (This depends on battery chemistry; shifts to LiFePO₄ or high-Ni/low-Co cells would reduce this, but many projected cells for 2030 still use NMC/NCA cathodes.)  For context, the EU’s new CRMA and the US IRA are both driving strong EV growth (and domestic content rules) that imply heavy cobalt usage in those markets.  
• **Aerospace & Defense (superalloys)**:  A significant portion of cobalt is used in high-temperature superalloys for aircraft engines, gas turbines, and military hardware.  Historically, ~50% of U.S. cobalt has gone into superalloys ([elements.visualcapitalist.com](https://elements.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-cobalt-production-by-country-in-2023/#:~:text=In%20the%20U.S.%2C%2050,in%20aircraft%20gas%20turbine%20engines)), and allied nations have similar needs for cobalt in jet engines and military communications (which use Co-containing specialty steel and hard-facing alloys). The U.S. Department of Defense and aerospace industry (e.g. Pratt & Whitney, GE Aviation) require hundreds to a few thousand tonnes annually of high-purity Co. By 2030, continued aircraft production and military modernization could demand on the order of 10,000–20,000 t of cobalt in this sector among US/allies.  
• **Other battery/industrial uses**:  Beyond EVs, cobalt remains important in consumer electronics batteries, stationary backup batteries, and NiCd/NiMH batteries (still significant in Japan). Cobalt catalysts, magnetic alloys, and chemical compounds (pigments, drying paints) also consume a few percent of supply.  These “other” uses (combined maybe 10–20% of demand) might add another ~20–30 ktyr by 2030 across US/allies. (For instance, cobalt catalysts in petroleum and chemical industries are used for high-temperature syngas and Fischer–Tropsch processes.)  
• **Imports and stockpiles**: US/allies have minimal domestic margin, so most demand must be met by imports. No precise public forecast for “US+allies demand (t)” exists, but summing sectors above: on the order of 80–150 kt/yr by 2030.  Note that Europe (and Japan) are already heavily import-dependent ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=Finland%20has%20a%20significant%20role,of%20the%20country%27s%20demand%2C%20as)); domestic recycling and scrap currently cover only a small fraction of demand. Recent news emphasizes this import gap: e.g. the U.S. defense supply plan points out the U.S. stockpile of cobalt is far below needs ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/#:~:text=The%20U,cobalt%20demand%20is%20also%20attributed)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Mining output**:  Even with proposed new projects, allied mining will supply only a small fraction of 2030 demand.  For example, the Idaho mine may restart at ~10 kt/yr if prices recover ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-cobalt-miner-trump-use-tariffs-scalpel-not-sledgehammer-2024-12-11/#:~:text=markets%20with%20cheap%20cobalt%2C%20often,for%20electric%20vehicle%20batteries%20and)) ([jervoisglobal.com](https://jervoisglobal.com/projects/idaho-cobalt-operations/#:~:text=ICO%20is%20the%20only%20primary,to%20the%20low%20carbon%20economy)), Canada has several planned projects (e.g. Cheetah Resources, First Cobalt) that might add a few thousand tonnes by late 2020s, and Australia’s production could rise toward ~5–6 kt/yr if nickel demand improves.  However, these gains (perhaps +5–10 kt beyond today’s production) would be overshadowed by demand. The EU has no new cobalt mines slated, though it aims to “mine 10%” of its cobalt needs by 2030 under the CRM Act ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-announces-list-47-strategic-metals-projects-2025-03-25/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20has%20announced,processing%2C%20and%20recycling%20of%20metals)).  In practice, allied mining supply will likely remain on the order of ~20–30 kt/yr by 2030.  

• **Processing/refining capacity**:  Supply also depends on refining.  Europe is investing in new processing: France’s EMME project plans to refine ~1,500 t/yr of cobalt (along with Ni) starting ~2028 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/france-backs-nickel-refinery-project-bolster-battery-supply-chain-2024-05-13/#:~:text=la%20soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20suisse%20KL1%2C%20vise,dispose%20d%C3%A9j%C3%A0%20d%27une%20industrie%20mini%C3%A8re)). The EU’s CRM Act further aims to process 40% of its critical materials by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-announces-list-47-strategic-metals-projects-2025-03-25/#:~:text=The%20European%20Commission%20has%20announced,processing%2C%20and%20recycling%20of%20metals)), which for cobalt would translate to only a few thousand tonnes of refined output.  In the U.S., there is currently no primary cobalt refining; raw cobalt would have to be shipped abroad for conversion.  Japan and Norway have some refining of imported cobalt (Norilsk’s Harjavalta plant in Finland produces ~1,000 t/yr of Co chemicals ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=two%20mines%20are%20extracting%20cobalt,of%20the%20known%20global%20cobalt)), and Japanese firms refine ammoniacal leachate from imports), but domestic processing in allied countries as of 2025 is very limited.  

• **Recycling and waste recovery**:  By 2030, allied recycling could give minor relief.  Europe projects recycling battery metals at a scale that could support ~2 million EVs/yr (which implies recovering a few thousand tonnes of Co) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europe-set-miss-potential-battery-material-recycling-2024-12-11/#:~:text=Europe%20has%20the%20potential%20to,The%20European)), but this is far short of annual demand.  The U.S. and Japan are also ramping battery recycling (LFP shift will produce lithium; NMC cells yield some Co), but true circularity is unlikely without major policy boosts.  

• **Overall supply vs. demand gap**:  Summing the above, U.S./allied mines+refineries might supply on the order of 20–35 kt/yr by 2030 (including recycling), whereas demand could be ~100 kt or more.  This implies an enduring shortfall on the order of tens of thousands of tons, necessitating large imports (mostly from the DRC/Indonesia or Chinese intermediates).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geophysical Surveys (Magnetic/EM)**: Cobalt is often hosted in nickel–copper–cobalt sulfide deposits (e.g. Iron Creek, Idaho). Ground and airborne magnetic and electromagnetic surveys can map these sulfide zones. For instance, a 2021 geophysics campaign at Idaho’s Iron Creek deposit identified new cobalt-copper targets ([electrabmc.com](https://electrabmc.com/news/first-cobalt-geophysical-survey-identifies-new-drill-targets-at-idaho-project#:~:text=TORONTO%2C%20ON%20%E2%80%94%20,resumption%20of%20drilling%20to%20expand)). Geophysical methods (ground EM, induced polarization, magnetics) are effective for uncovering buried sulfide bodies.  
• **Geochemical Sampling & Mapping**: Stream-sediment and soil geochemistry targeting cobalt and pathfinders (Ni, Cu, As, etc.) is fundamental. Mapping alteration zones (e.g. ultramafic/mafic intrusions or skarns) helps narrow search areas. For example, projects in Canada and Australia routinely sample regolith for Co anomalies near known Ni deposits. Airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can also detect specific alteration minerals (e.g. serpentine, chlorite) associated with cobaltiferous orebodies.  
• **Radiometric Surveys**: Cobalt deposits can sometimes correlate with uranium/thorium anomalies. Airborne radiometric surveys (measuring gamma rays) may highlight silicified or radioactive core complexes. In some cases, pegmatites or skarns containing cobalt-blue minerals (cobaltite, skutterudite) also contain elevated U/Th. Integrating radiometric data with geology can flag prospective zones (similarly to REE exploration methods).  
• **Machine Learning & Data Integration**: Modern AI/ML techniques are increasingly applied to integrate geological, geochemical, remote sensing and drilling datasets to predict hidden cobalt deposits. Spatial analytics can identify subtle patterns across mining regions. These advanced analytics complement traditional prospecting by prioritizing targets for follow-up. (For example, lithogeochemical pattern recognition has been used in the Canadian Shield to highlight Ni–Co belt anomalies.)  
• **Drilling & 3-D Imaging**: Ultimately, core drilling is used to confirm Co-rich ore. New techniques include downhole geophysics and 3D geological modeling from drill data to refine orebody geometries. These drilling results feed into resource models to estimate Co tonnage (as Jervois did at Idaho ([jervoisglobal.com](https://jervoisglobal.com/projects/idaho-cobalt-operations/#:~:text=ICO%20is%20the%20only%20primary,to%20the%20low%20carbon%20economy))).  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Sulfide Ore Processing (Flotation)**: Most primary cobalt (outside laterite) is recovered by flotation of copper–nickel sulfide ores.  After crushing and milling, flotation produces a copper–nickel–cobalt concentrate (e.g. at Canada’s Raglan or Finland’s Kevitsa). Similar methods apply in the U.S. if any sulfide Ni–Cu–Co orebodies are mined.  
• **Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL)**: Cobalt-bearing laterite ores (mostly in Indonesia/Australia) are processed by high-pressure, high-temperature sulfuric acid leach.  This HPAL method dissolves nickel and cobalt into solution. For example, Indonesia’s new HPAL plants (Morowali, Weda Bay, etc.) collectively process nickel laterite to produce “mixed hydroxide precipitate” (MHP) containing Co ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-cobalt-producers-country-updated-2024#:~:text=Indonesia%20cobalt%20production%20topped%2028%2C000,output%20sat%20at%202%2C700%20MT)). Allied mining lacks domestic HPAL plants, but this technology is critical globally for Co extraction.  
• **Ammoniacal or Alkaline Leaching**: Some projects use ammonia-based leaches on oxide ores. For low-grade Co tailings or refractory ores, alkaline (e.g. ammoniacal) solutions can preferentially dissolve cobalt and nickel. (Historic cobalt operations, like Norway’s Skuterud, used ammonia leach to separate cobalt from arsenides.)  
• **Bio-oxidation / Heap Leaching (R&D)**: In theory, certain bacteria can oxidize nickel sulfide tailings, freeing cobalt. A few pilot studies have tested bio-leaching of low-grade Ni–Co ores, but this remains niche. Similarly, heap leaching of cobaltiferous waste using weak acid is under investigation for tailings reuse.  
• **Roasting / Calcination**: Cobalt concentrates or intermediate hydroxides may be thermally treated. For example, Roasting Ni-Co hydroxide precipitate (from HPAL) at ~500°C drives off water and NH₃, yielding cobalt oxide. This oxide is then used in refinement steps.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX)**: Widely used to separate Co from Ni, Cu, and Fe in leach solutions. Common extractants (e.g. Cyanex 272, LIX reagents) selectively bind Co²⁺ at controlled pH.  For instance, after HPAL of laterite, cobalt is liberated in acid and subsequently extracted and stripped to produce a purified Co sulfate solution. Likewise, SX is employed at hydrometallurgical plants (e.g. Norilsk Nickel’s Harjavalta) to purify nickel cake liquor and recover ~1,000 t/yr of Co chemicals ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=two%20mines%20are%20extracting%20cobalt,of%20the%20known%20global%20cobalt)).  
• **Ion Exchange (IX) / Adsorption**: Ion-exchange resins (e.g. chelating resins or activated carbon) can selectively capture Co²⁺ from solution. Some battery recycling facilities use IX columns to remove cobalt and nickel from leachates before electrowinning. The Ni–Co sulfate circuits at some refineries (e.g. Japanese or Finnish plants) also use fixed-bed ion exchangers for polishing.  
• **Precipitation and Crystallization**: Cobalt can be precipitated directly from solution. Aqueous Co can be precipitated as cobalt hydroxide or carbonate by raising pH (with alkali or ammonium) once nickel has been removed. Cobalt sulfate (CoSO₄) can be crystallized by concentrating sulfate solutions (with evaporators or anti-solvents).  These solid products (Co(OH)₂ or CoSO₄·7H₂O) are intermediate steps that require further refining to high purity.  
• **Electrowinning / Electro-refining**: In some circuits, cobalt is recovered by electrowinning (cathodic electroplating) from purified sulfate solutions, yielding impure cobalt metal. Alternatively, cobalt sulfate solutions may be purified and sold directly (especially for battery precursor salts). (Historical mining like Voisey’s Bay initially shipped Ni–Cu–Co ores for external sulfate production.)  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Chemical Purification of Cobalt Sulfate**: After SX/IX, cobalt is often refined to battery-grade chemicals. For example, Norilsk Nickel’s Harjavalta plant in Finland produced ~1,000 t of high-purity cobalt sulfate annually ([www.lyellcollection.org](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/geoenergy2023-016#:~:text=two%20mines%20are%20extracting%20cobalt,of%20the%20known%20global%20cobalt)). Similar processes (solvent extraction + crystallization) are used by major refiners (Umicore, Sherritt’s ICP in Canada, Sumitomo in Philippines).  Precise pH and redox control ensures removal of trace impurities (Fe, Ni, Cu) to meet battery-grade specs.  
• **Metal Production (Electrowinning/Reduction)**: Cobalt metal is produced industrially either by electrolytic reduction or thermal reduction of oxides. In one route, purified Co sulfate solution is electrolyzed to plate metallic cobalt cathodes. Another route is to roast or reduce cobalt oxide (Co₃O₄ → CoO/Co) and then carbon-reduce it to metal powder. Allied-capable refiners (e.g. a planned EMME facility ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/france-backs-nickel-refinery-project-bolster-battery-supply-chain-2024-05-13/#:~:text=la%20soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20suisse%20KL1%2C%20vise,dispose%20d%C3%A9j%C3%A0%20d%27une%20industrie%20mini%C3%A8re)) or existing Glencore/CRMC plants) can produce cobalt metal or metal alloys for specialty markets.  
• **Battery-Salt Synthesis**: For EV markets, cobalt is usually delivered as cobalt sulfate or hydroxide.  Modern refiners ensure their sulfate is in the correct hydration state and concentration (e.g. CoSO₄·7H₂O at ~200 g/L) for Li-ion cathode production. Technologies include dedicated crystallizers and dryers.  (For example, Sumitomo Metal Mining in Japan operates batch crystallization units to yield CoSO₄·7H₂O suitable for NMC cathodes.)  
• **Electrochemical Recovery (Recycling)**: In advanced recycling, spent Li-ion cathode powders are processed via hydrometallurgy (leach) then purified back to cobalt salts. Electrochemical cells (e.g. flow batteries or electrodialysis) are also being piloted to recover Co from mixed-metal solutions with minimal chemical reagents.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Neutralization and Precipitation**: Mining and milling wastewater is treated by neutralizing acidity (lime or limestone addition), causing heavy metals (including Co²⁺) to precipitate as hydroxides/sulfides. Passive systems (e.g. constructed wetlands or limestone drains) can remove Co from AMD (acid mine drainage) by raising pH. For example, lime neutralization units are standard at nickel mines to capture cobalt in the sludge.  
• **Phytoremediation and Bioaccumulation**: Certain plants (nickel hyperaccumulators or metal-tolerant ferns) can uptake trace cobalt from soils or tailings. Trials in Canada and Europe use species like *Alyssum* or *Pteris vitata* to clean metal-contaminated sites. On a larger scale, biomass harvesting (e.g. Pil ore processing using bacteria) is experimental.  
• **Adsorption/Filtration Solutions**: Activated carbon or ion-exchange media can scrub cobalt from process waters or leachates. Systems using zeolites, clays, or engineered resins trap Co²⁺ effectively. Such media are used in wastewater streams from refining plants to capture residual cobalt before discharge, allowing Co recovery from the spent media.  
• **Tailings Capping and Containment**: Modern cobalt projects (as required by regulators) employ engineered tailings basins with liners or covers to prevent leaching. Cover materials (clay, geomembranes) keep oxygen out, limiting acid generation. Monitoring wells and water treatment plants are standard. Some tailings are dry-stacked or shallow-landfilled to minimize water contact and leaching. These site-specific controls are critical “passive” remediation measures at cobalt mining sites.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Refining/Processing Capacity**: The dominant bottleneck is lack of indigenous cobalt refining.  Even if mines produce ore, allied nations lack facilities to convert Co into battery-grade chemicals.  China currently dominates cobalt refining (cobalt sulfate/mixed hydroxide production) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/#:~:text=The%20U,cobalt%20demand%20is%20also%20attributed)). U.S. (and many allies) have essentially no primary refining plants – forcing raw Co to be shipped abroad. This creates vulnerability: as Reuters notes, the U.S. “considered”(but did not act on) stockpiling cobalt due to China’s stranglehold on processing ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/#:~:text=The%20U,cobalt%20demand%20is%20also%20attributed)). Without significant new refinery investment (hydrometallurgy or recycling plants), domestic/ally supply cannot scale.  
• **Economic Competitiveness (Market Pricing)**: Relatedly, low cobalt prices (from DRC/Indonesia oversupply and LFP battery chemistries) have stalled new mines. Jervois’ Idaho project was suspended when cobalt plunged ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-cobalt-miner-trump-use-tariffs-scalpel-not-sledgehammer-2024-12-11/#:~:text=markets%20with%20cheap%20cobalt%2C%20often,for%20electric%20vehicle%20batteries%20and)). In effect, allied mining technology is ready (Idaho mine built, HPAL proven), but market viability (and financing) is a bottleneck. This is a techno-economic issue: extraction and processing equipment exists, but capital flows depend on prices and policy. As one analyst notes, cheap Chinese cobalt has “hindered development of independent Western cobalt supply chains” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/another-cobalt-bust-this-time-its-different-andy-home-2025-02-06/#:~:text=The%20cobalt%20market%20is%20experiencing,a%20cobalt%20supply%20glut%2C%20the)).  
• **Permitting and Infrastructure**: Developing new cobalt sources is slowed by lengthy permitting and lack of infrastructure.  Advanced mining and processing projects require decades to move from discovery to production (as the U.S. rarely builds mines quickly ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/6a72d0da-ec2e-4235-9adc-1500412614eb#:~:text=2025,with%20each%20shell%20containing%20up))). This delay is a technological bottleneck in the sense of project delivery. For example, even with identified Co resources (like in Finland or Alaska), it takes many years for feasibility studies, waste-water treatment design, and construction to implement extraction.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The critical bottleneck for US/allied cobalt supply is in downstream processing and economics. China’s dominance of cobalt refining means allied mines would have nowhere to process ore domestically ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-explored-adding-more-cobalt-defence-stockpiles-sources-say-2024-03-18/#:~:text=The%20U,cobalt%20demand%20is%20also%20attributed)), forcing reliance on external processors. Coupled with depressed metal prices and long development timelines, this has kept new projects offline ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-cobalt-miner-trump-use-tariffs-scalpel-not-sledgehammer-2024-12-11/#:~:text=markets%20with%20cheap%20cobalt%2C%20often,for%20electric%20vehicle%20batteries%20and)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/another-cobalt-bust-this-time-its-different-andy-home-2025-02-06/#:~:text=The%20cobalt%20market%20is%20experiencing,a%20cobalt%20supply%20glut%2C%20the)). In short, the technology to extract cobalt exists, but the key constraints are lack of in-country refining capacity and uneconomic market conditions, which together hamper growth of a sovereign supply chain.
