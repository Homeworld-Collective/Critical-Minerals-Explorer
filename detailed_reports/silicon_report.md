## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:**  In 2022 the U.S. produced ~265,000 t of silicon (including metallurgical Si and ferrosilicon) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/301515/us-silicon-production/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20the%20United%20States,part%20of%20the%20automotive%20industry)). Major plants include Dow/Elkem (Mt. Meigs, AL), Ferroglobe (Bridgeport, AL; Niagara Falls, NY; Alloy, WV) and Mississippi Silicon (Burnsville, MS) – the latter being the first new U.S. silicon-metal plant in decades and supplying about 10% of U.S. demand ([www.missilicon.com](https://www.missilicon.com/#:~:text=Mississippi%20Silicon%20is%20the%20first,used%20in%20the%20United%20States)).  (Dow/Elkem and Ferroglobe plants output both high-purity silicon metal and FeSi alloys.)  
• **Allied Producers:**  Outside the U.S., silicon metal output is much smaller.  **Australia’s** sole smelter (Simcoa, Portland VIC) produces ~52,000 t/yr of high-purity Si metal ([www.simcoa.com.au](https://www.simcoa.com.au/company#:~:text=match%20at%20L24%2052%2C000%20tonnes,grade%20control%20maintained%20also%20provides)) (with an additional ~13,000 t of silica fume byproduct).  **Norway** (Norsk Hydro/Elkem plants and related facilities) accounts for only ~4% of global Si production ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=Finally%2C%20silicon%20production%20should%20be,in%20Brazilian%20and%20Norwegian%20silicon)); **Brazil** likewise ~5% ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=Finally%2C%20silicon%20production%20should%20be,in%20Brazilian%20and%20Norwegian%20silicon)).  **Canada, EU, Japan,** etc., have minimal silicon-metal mines (production is mainly ferrosilicon for steel).  Combined, US + allied output is well under 10% of world supply (China held ~79% in 2023 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=match%20at%20L255%20of%20transistors,purity%20polysilicon%20needed))).  In practice, North American and European production today is on the order of a few 10^5 t/yr (vs. global ~6.6×10^6 t/yr ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=match%20at%20L255%20of%20transistors,purity%20polysilicon%20needed))).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Solar PV:** Demand for silicon (as SiO_2 feedstock and metallurgical Si) will surge with one estimate showing U.S. solar buildout (∼1 TW by 2030) requiring ~700,000 t/yr of Si metal ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/ira-energy-transition-to-spur-western-silicon-metal-production/#:~:text=Tymko%20calculates%20that%20the%20US,far%20outstripping%20current%20production%20capacity)).  European and Japanese solar targets imply similarly massive need (e.g. EU plans for ∼0.5–0.6 TW solar by 2030 suggests hundreds of kilotons).  This new solar-driven demand would far exceed current Western output.  
• **Semiconductors and Electronics:**  Expansion of CHIPS‐Act fabs and 5G/AI electronics boosts demand for high-purity silicon (poly-Si).  Western wafer fabs (Sumco, Shin-Etsu, Hemlock, etc.) currently require on the order of 50–100 kt/yr of ultra-pure Si.  By 2030, allied chip-buildout could push total Si demand well above present levels.  
• **Automotive/Alloys:**  Lightweighting vehicles increases Si use in Al alloys, and high-performance steels use ferrosilicon.  For example, EVs and wind-turbine steels, which use high-Si electrical steel (up to ~75% Si in FeSi) ([www.elkem.com](https://www.elkem.com/about-elkem/worldwide-presence/iceland/elkem-iceland/production-process/#:~:text=The%20company%20meets%20the%20criteria,of%20about%201700%20%C2%B0C%2C%20is)), add to consumption.  Overall, industrial Si demand in North America is projected to grow ~48% by 2035 ([sinovaglobal.com](https://sinovaglobal.com/about-silicon/the-energy-transition/#:~:text=%2B48)).  In sum, US+allied silicon demand by 2030 could approach or exceed ~1.0 Mt/yr — several times today’s production — driven largely by clean-energy and electronics sectors.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Production Growth:**  Through 2030, U.S. and allied silicon-metal output is expected to grow only modestly without major new plants. U.S. smelters (current ~265 kt/yr) may add capacity from projects like Mississippi Silicon’s planned expansion, but absent breakthroughs domestic supply will likely remain below ~400 kt/yr by 2030.  Industry analysts warn current U.S. silicon capacity “could be outstripped by demand” from solar projects by 2030 ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/ira-energy-transition-to-spur-western-silicon-metal-production/#:~:text=He%20predicted%20that%20domestic%20silicon,new%20solar%20projects%20by%202030)) ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/ira-energy-transition-to-spur-western-silicon-metal-production/#:~:text=Tymko%20calculates%20that%20the%20US,far%20outstripping%20current%20production%20capacity)). Western Europe and Japan have no announced greenfield Si-metal projects of comparable scale; their combined output will likely stay under ~0.1 Mt/yr (mostly from small ferrosilicon lines).  
• **Imports and Trade:**  Even with planned expansions, US/allied supply will fall far short of projected demand. Consequently, the U.S. and partners will continue importing most Si metal and Si feedstock from friendly sources.  Key suppliers would include Norway (ferrosilicon), Brazil (metallurgical Si and FeSi), and possibly Canada if new projects start.  Polysilicon (for chips/solar) is projected to remain dependent on imports or allied polysilicon production.  Recycling (e.g. recovering Si from end-of-life solar panels and electronics) may contribute slightly, but is not yet a major source (current recycling yields <<10 kt/yr in the U.S.).

Mississippi Silicon (Burnsville, MS) operational since 2015 and meeting ~10% of U.S. demand ([www.missilicon.com](https://www.missilicon.com/#:~:text=Mississippi%20Silicon%20is%20the%20first,used%20in%20the%20United%20States)).  Australian data from Simcoa corporate reports (~52,000 t/yr) ([www.simcoa.com.au](https://www.simcoa.com.au/company#:~:text=match%20at%20L24%2052%2C000%20tonnes,grade%20control%20maintained%20also%20provides)).  Forecasts from consultancy and industry: e.g. Fastmarkets analysis (Tymko) predicting ~700,000 t/yr U.S. demand by 2030 ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/ira-energy-transition-to-spur-western-silicon-metal-production/#:~:text=Tymko%20calculates%20that%20the%20US,far%20outstripping%20current%20production%20capacity)), and CSIRO/PwC forecasting ~48% growth in North American silicon metal demand by 2035 ([sinovaglobal.com](https://sinovaglobal.com/about-silicon/the-energy-transition/#:~:text=%2B48)).  Global production shares (China 79%, Norway 4%, Brazil 5%) are from CSIS and Statista ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=match%20at%20L255%20of%20transistors,purity%20polysilicon%20needed)) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=Finally%2C%20silicon%20production%20should%20be,in%20Brazilian%20and%20Norwegian%20silicon)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geologic Mapping & Remote Sensing:** High-purity silica sand and quartzite deposits are located by geologic surveys and satellite/hyperspectral imaging.  Quartz has distinctive short-wave infrared reflectance, so ASTER or Landsat can help identify SiO_2-rich outcrops.  Geologic maps are used to target Proterozoic quartzite ridges or sandstone aquifers known to host >98% SiO_2 ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268981766_Global_Production_Chains_and_Sustainability_The_case_of_high-purity_silicon_and_its_applications_in_IT_and_renewable_energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L1765%20a%20typical,production%20is%3A%20SiO2%20content)).  
• **Geochemical Prospecting:** Systematic sampling of soils, stream sediments or groundwater measures SiO_2 vs. impurities (Al_2O_3, Fe_2O_3, CaO). Anomalously high free silica and low alumina/iron indicate potential feedstock quality. Assays target >98% SiO_2 (typical quartz-metal feed spec ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268981766_Global_Production_Chains_and_Sustainability_The_case_of_high-purity_silicon_and_its_applications_in_IT_and_renewable_energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L1765%20a%20typical,production%20is%3A%20SiO2%20content))).  
• **Airborne Geophysics:** Gravity and electromagnetic surveys help delineate buried quartz sand bodies (low density, low conductivity). Airborne gravimetry can locate thick quartz basins under sediment cover; magnetic surveys check for metallic overburden.  
• **Drilling & Trenching:** Core drilling confirms deposit purity and grain size fraction (10–100 mm chips preferred ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268981766_Global_Production_Chains_and_Sustainability_The_case_of_high-purity_silicon_and_its_applications_in_IT_and_renewable_energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L1765%20a%20typical,production%20is%3A%20SiO2%20content))). Auger or core logs assess cementation and weathering. Drill cores are assayed for SiO_2 content and screened to verify friability.  
• **Soil and Stream Sediment Sampling:** Analytical labs rapidly test silica content and trace contaminants (e.g. phosphorus, boron) to focus exploration. Elevated trace-metal anomalies may flag later refinement needs.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit Quarrying:** Commercial silica mining is typically by open-pit methods ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268981766_Global_Production_Chains_and_Sustainability_The_case_of_high-purity_silicon_and_its_applications_in_IT_and_renewable_energy#:~:text=mined%20from%20open%20pits%20containing,and%20sandstone%2C%20though%20extraction%20is)). Blasting or ripping loosens hard quartzite; loaders and haul trucks remove rock to crushers.  For sand bodies, large shovels and conveyors move material. Blasted rock is crushed in multi-stage crushing (jaw and cone crushers) and screened to produce 10–100 mm quartz feed ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268981766_Global_Production_Chains_and_Sustainability_The_case_of_high-purity_silicon_and_its_applications_in_IT_and_renewable_energy#:~:text=match%20at%20L1765%20a%20typical,production%20is%3A%20SiO2%20content)) ready for smelting.  
• **Dredging:** In some areas (e.g. offshore or river-delta sands), hydraulic dredges (backhoes or cutter-suction pumps) extract high-purity quartz sand from underwater traps or beaches ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268981766_Global_Production_Chains_and_Sustainability_The_case_of_high-purity_silicon_and_its_applications_in_IT_and_renewable_energy#:~:text=mined%20from%20open%20pits%20containing,and%20sandstone%2C%20though%20extraction%20is)). Such dredged quartz is dewatered and graded similarly to quarried stone.  
• **Electric Arc Furnaces:** Industrial silicon metal production uses submerged-arc furnaces (graphite electrodes). Quartz feedstock is mixed with carbon reductants (petroleum coke or charcoal), and – for ferrosilicon – iron ore flux is added.  The mix is heated to ∼1650–1700 °C, reducing SiO_2 to molten silicon (or FeSi alloy) and CO/CO_2 gas ([www.elkem.com](https://www.elkem.com/about-elkem/worldwide-presence/iceland/elkem-iceland/production-process/#:~:text=In%20the%20furnaces%2C%20quartz%20and,of%20about%201700%20%C2%B0C%2C%20is)).  Most U.S./European smelters (Elkem, Ferroatlántica, etc.) use DC or AC arc furnaces powered by grids or dedicated hydroelectric plants (to lower carbon footprint).  
• **Supporting Technologies:** Automated feeder systems meter quartz and coke into the furnace. Off-gas is captured under hopper/smoke hoods.  Temperature and current are computer-controlled to optimize reduction.  Elkem plants, for example, employ semi-closed radiators and continuous tapping to maximize metal yield ([www.elkem.com](https://www.elkem.com/about-elkem/worldwide-presence/iceland/elkem-iceland/production-process/#:~:text=In%20the%20furnaces%2C%20quartz%20and,of%20about%201700%20%C2%B0C%2C%20is)).  
• **Alternate Methods (R&D):** Emerging techniques include submerged-arc with green hydrogen (hydrogen plasma smelting) and concentrated solar reduction (thermochemical). Research prototypes (e.g. solar furnace in Australia) aim to replace carbon reductants with renewable heat, but these are not yet commercial.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Metal–Slag Tapping:** The principal separation is gravity-based: molten silicon (or ferrosilicon) is tapped from the furnace, leaving oxidic slag behind. The metal/pulp layer is removed through a tap hole into ladles. Slag (mostly waste SiO_2 with some catalyst oxides) is dumped separately.  
• **Dust Collection:** Any floating silica or metal droplets in off-gas are removed via cyclones or baghouse filters. Modern plants recycle this captured SiO_2 dust back as furnace feed ([www.elkem.com](https://www.elkem.com/about-elkem/worldwide-presence/iceland/elkem-iceland/production-process/#:~:text=into%20ingots%20or%20cast%20straight,water%20to%20accelerate%20solidification%20and)). For example, Elkem grinds solidified ingots and adds the fines back to the melt ([www.elkem.com](https://www.elkem.com/about-elkem/worldwide-presence/iceland/elkem-iceland/production-process/#:~:text=into%20ingots%20or%20cast%20straight,water%20to%20accelerate%20solidification%20and)).  
• **Pressure Filtration (Solvent Separation):** In advanced alloy purification, molten metal is decanted through filters under gas pressure.  A recent study showed that in Sn–Si refining, applying ∼0.3 MPa Ar pressure through a ceramic filter forced 93.6% of Si to stay in the melt while Sn passed through ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ra/c9ra09077k#:~:text=separation%20contributed%20to%20the%20removal,0%20wt)). This separates solvent (Sn) from purified Si crystals.  
• **Distillation (for Parasitic SiCl_4):** In polysilicon plants, metallurgical Si is converted to SiCl_4 gas, then distilled to separate SiCl_4 from other chlorosilanes. Though more a purification step, it effectively separates Si from metallic impurities.  
• **Magnetic Separation:** If ferrosilicon scrap or mixed alloys are recycled, magnetic separators can pull out the ferromagnetic FeSi alloy, leaving non-magnetic Si/slag aside. This is used mainly in recycling environments.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Siemens CVD Process:** The dominant method for semiconductor/solar-grade Si. Metallurgical Si is reacted with HCl at ~300–350 °C to form trichlorosilane (SiHCl_3). After multiple distillations to purify (≥99.9999% Si, “6N” purity), the gas is decomposed on heated silicon rods at ~1100 °C, yielding high-purity polycrystalline Si.  Major allied producers (Hemlock – USA; Sumitomo, Shin-Etsu – Japan; Wacker, REC – Europe) operate these reactors. (China currently controls ~75% of global polysilicon ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=of%20transistors%20are%20squeezed%20onto,purity%20polysilicon%20needed)).)  
• **Fluidized-Bed Reactors:** A continuous alternative: SiHCl_3 + H_2 react in a fluidized bed of fine Si particles, causing Si to deposit as powder. Companies like Wacker (MinMet facility) use this method. It has lower energy per ton (~50% of Siemens) and inherently high throughput.  
• **Solvent (Metallurgical) Refining:** Impurities can be removed by alloying MG-Si with other molten metals. For example, adding liquid tin and holding at ~250 °C lets impurities segregate into the Sn. Pressurized gas filtration (above) then separates pure Si. In one study this “Sn–Si” refining removed ~95% of boron and 76% of phosphorus in two passes ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2020/ra/c9ra09077k#:~:text=impurity%20content%20in%20the%20secondary,and%20was)), approaching solar-grade levels.  Analogously, Al–Si or Ca–Si solvent systems have been investigated.  
• **Zone/Float-Zone Refining:** Directional solidification of a melted zone along a Si rod pushes impurities to one end. In practice, float-zone furnaces can produce Si ≥8N purity for ultrapure applications. Allied silicon crystal growers (e.g. Japanese fabs) use float-zone for electronic-grade ingots.  
• **Halide Distillation:** Processes like fluidized-bed chlorination use Si powder + Cl_2 to make pure SiCl_4, then hydrolyze to silica or reductively deposit Si.  (The resurging ELKEM/REC process uses an HCl loop to purify MG-Si.)  
• **Electrochemical Methods:** Molten salt electrolysis (e.g. FFC Cam­­bridge process) is experimental: silica is dissolved in CaCl_2 and reduced at a cathode to Si metal, producing O_2 at the anode. This offers a low-carbon route but is not yet commercial.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Baghouse Filtering:** Modern smelters (Elkem, Ferroatlántica, etc.) enclose furnaces with fabric filters. Furnace off-gas (containing SiO_2 dust, CO_2, SO_2) passes through high-efficiency baghouses – silica particulates are >99% captured ([www.elkem.com](https://www.elkem.com/about-elkem/worldwide-presence/iceland/elkem-iceland/production-process/#:~:text=travels%20through%20cooling%20facilities%20and,of%20about%201700%20%C2%B0C%2C%20is)). Collected dust is recycled as furnace feed (minimizing waste).  
• **Wet Scrubbers:** Acid gases (SO_2, HF, HCl) from the furnace are treated via caustic or lime scrubbing. Multi-stage scrubbers neutralize acid and remove water-soluble pollutants before emission. Some operations regenerate scrubbing solutions.  
• **Water Treatment:** Process water and storm runoff from quarries are treated on-site. Suspended silica is removed in settling ponds; pH is neutralized (e.g. limestone filters). Cleaned effluent is reused or safely discharged under EPA mining effluent standards.  
• **Tailings Stabilization:** Silica tailings (sand and rock fines) are generally inert (non-acid-forming). Mines re-contour tailings piles, apply clay or synthetic liners (to prevent erosion), and re-vegetate surfaces to prevent dust. Where feasible, silica fines can be repurposed as construction sand or filled back into exhausted pits.  
• **Dust Suppression:** In open-pit sites, roads and crushing plants use water sprays and surfactants to suppress respirable silica dust (limiting silicosis risk). Enclosed conveyors and covered storage stockpiles are employed.  
• **CO2 Abatement (Emerging):** New projects consider capturing furnace CO_2 (e.g. with amine scrubbing) or using carbon–neutral reductants (biochar, or hydrogen plasma) to reduce the carbon footprint. (Elkem’s Iceland plant, for instance, is researching green hydrogen to replace carbon coke ([www.csiro.au](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/natural-environment/Critical-minerals/Australian-Silicon-Action-Plan#:~:text=Considering%20new%20process%20techniques%2C%20like,and%20in%20creating%20new%20industries)).)

• **Industrial reports:** Fastmarkets and CSIS briefs detail allied capacities and demand projections ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/ira-energy-transition-to-spur-western-silicon-metal-production/#:~:text=Tymko%20calculates%20that%20the%20US,far%20outstripping%20current%20production%20capacity)) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=of%20transistors%20are%20squeezed%20onto,purity%20polysilicon%20needed)), highlighting the lack of Western capacity for high-purity Si.  

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **High-Temperature Smelting:** The submerged-arc reduction furnace itself is the rate-limiting step. These furnaces demand enormous power (~200–250 kWh/t Si) and high-quality electrodes. New 50–100 MVA furnaces take years and hundreds of millions of dollars to build. Without a breakthrough (e.g. hydrogen plasma), this limits how fast domestic output can scale. Economical, carbon-free electric power is also needed for each additional furnace – a constraint in many regions.  
• **Polysilicon Refining Plants:** Converting metallurgical Si to ultrapure polysilicon is a capital- and energy-intensive chokepoint. Currently only three U.S. firms make high-purity polysilicon ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=company%20that%20refines%20high,innovate%20and%20ramp%20up%20production)) (plus a few in EU/JP), so expanding that capacity is slow. The entire Siemens process (chlorination, distillation, deposition) requires specialized equipment and feeds (e.g. ultra-­clean HCl and H2), posing a technology bottleneck for domestic chip-grade Si production.  
• **Quartz Feedstock Quality:** Finding and permitting large quartz deposits of requisite purity (≥98–99% SiO_2) is difficult. Even with good quartz sources, impurity removal (especially boron, phosphorus) requires multiple refinement steps. The tight spec (similar to [58]) means new mines must be carefully evaluated and often treated chemically, slowing new supply start-up.  
• **Supply Chain Dependencies:** Ancillary bottlenecks include dependence on imported raw materials (e.g. carbon electrodes, specialty reductants) and permitting delays for new mines/smelters. Overall, the integrated silicon production chain – from mine to metal to polysilicon – has few “off-the-shelf” solutions that can be quickly scaled in allied countries without major investment.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
The allied silicon supply chain is primarily bottlenecked by the energy- and capital-intensive smelting and refining technologies. In practice, Western producers have limited capacity in both raw silicon metal and semiconductor-grade purification: as noted by industry sources, U.S. silicon output barely meets current demand and “could be outstripped by … solar projects by 2030” ([www.fastmarkets.com](https://www.fastmarkets.com/insights/ira-energy-transition-to-spur-western-silicon-metal-production/#:~:text=He%20predicted%20that%20domestic%20silicon,new%20solar%20projects%20by%202030)), while there are only a handful of polysilicon plants in allied countries ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mine-microchip#:~:text=company%20that%20refines%20high,innovate%20and%20ramp%20up%20production)). Expanding output requires building new multi-hundred-MVA furnaces and Siemens reactors – a slow, expensive process – so without significant innovation (e.g. electric power scale-up or new reduction chemistries) the domestic supply gap is expected to persist.
