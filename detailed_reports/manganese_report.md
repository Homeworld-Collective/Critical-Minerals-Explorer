## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: hydrometallurgical processing; battery-grade purification; domestic refining capacity*

The primary bottleneck is **downstream processing and refining infrastructure** for converting manganese ore into high-purity materials suitable for batteries and specialty applications. While the US and allies could potentially develop new mining capacity, they currently lack the critical midstream facilities needed to produce battery-grade manganese sulfate, electrolytic manganese metal (EMM), or high-purity ferromanganese domestically. Specifically, the bottleneck technologies include: (1) hydrometallurgical plants with solvent extraction circuits capable of achieving >99.95% purity manganese sulfate monohydrate for battery cathodes; (2) electrowinning facilities for producing EMM with <0.1% impurities; and (3) modern electric arc furnaces with controlled-atmosphere capabilities for specialty ferroalloy production. Without these processing capabilities, any domestically mined manganese ore would need to be exported for refining, perpetuating import dependence. The technical complexity and capital intensity of these facilities, combined with environmental permitting challenges and lack of existing expertise in Western nations, represent the most significant barriers to establishing a secure domestic manganese supply chain.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: US: 0 tons/year; Australia: 3-3.5 million tons Mn-content/year; Other allies: negligible*

US domestic manganese ore production is effectively zero, with the country maintaining 100% import reliance according to USGS data. The United States has no active manganese mines and relies entirely on imports for both manganese ore and processed manganese products. While development projects exist (notably Element 25's proposed Emily Project in Minnesota's Cuyuna Range, targeting 18.5% Mn grade ore), no commercial production has commenced. Historical mining districts in Arkansas (Batesville district) and other states remain inactive.

Canada similarly has no active manganese production, though the Woodstock project in New Brunswick holds a significant resource (56.7 Mt at approximately 10% Mn grade) that remains undeveloped. The European Union, Japan, and other allied nations also lack significant manganese mining operations.

Australia dominates allied production with approximately 6-7 million tonnes of manganese ore annually (containing roughly 3-3.5 million tonnes of manganese content, assuming 45-50% grade). The largest operation is GEMCO at Groote Eylandt, Northern Territory, which produced approximately 5.5 million tonnes of ore in 2023. This mine is operated by South32 (60% ownership) with the Anindilyakwa Land Council holding 40%. Additional Australian production comes from operations including Woodie Woodie in Western Australia and smaller mines in the Pilbara region.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 1.2-1.5 million tons Mn-content/year by 2030*

Manganese demand among US and allied nations is driven predominantly by steel production, which accounts for 90-95% of total consumption. The remaining 5-10% serves battery manufacturing, aluminum alloys, and chemical applications, with battery demand growing rapidly.

Steel sector demand can be estimated from production volumes. Combined steel output for the US (~85 Mt/year), EU (~140 Mt/year), Japan (~90 Mt/year), and other allies (~35 Mt/year) totals approximately 350 million tonnes annually. With manganese consumption averaging 7-10 kg per tonne of steel (accounting for various steel grades), this translates to roughly 2.5-3.5 million tonnes of manganese content demand globally, with US and core allies accounting for approximately 1.0-1.2 million tonnes of manganese content.

Battery sector demand is expanding rapidly with electric vehicle adoption. Current lithium-ion battery chemistries, particularly NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) and LMO (lithium manganese oxide), require significant manganese inputs. NMC batteries typically contain 10-20% manganese by cathode weight, translating to approximately 0.1-0.2 kg Mn per kWh of battery capacity. If allied nations achieve 500 GWh of annual battery production by 2030 (a conservative estimate given current growth trajectories), this would require 50,000-100,000 tonnes of high-purity manganese annually.

Total allied manganese demand by 2030 is projected at 1.2-1.5 million tonnes of manganese content, with steel maintaining dominant share but battery applications growing from current 3-5% to potentially 8-10% of total demand.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 3-4 million tons Mn-content/year, primarily from Australia*

By 2030, domestic manganese supply within allied nations will remain heavily concentrated in Australia, with minimal new production elsewhere. Australian output is expected to maintain current levels of 6-7 million tonnes of ore (3-3.5 million tonnes manganese content), though cyclone impacts and ore grade decline at mature mines pose risks.

Potential new production by 2030 includes:
- Element 25's Emily Project (Minnesota): Could produce 50,000-100,000 tonnes of manganese content annually if developed
- Canadian Manganese's Woodstock Project: Potential for 100,000-200,000 tonnes manganese content per year
- Euro Manganese's Chvaletice Project (Czech Republic): Targeting 50,000 tonnes of high-purity manganese products annually

Even under optimistic development scenarios, new projects would add only 200,000-400,000 tonnes of manganese content by 2030. This leaves allied nations with a structural supply deficit, requiring continued imports from South Africa (2+ million tonnes ore/year), Gabon (2+ million tonnes ore/year), and other non-allied sources to meet demand.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: open-pit mining; in-pit crushing; ore sorting; selective mining*

• **Conventional open-pit mining:** Large-scale manganese deposits are extracted using standard drill-blast-load-haul cycles. Modern operations employ 200-400 tonne haul trucks, hydraulic shovels with 30-50 m³ buckets, and rotary drills for 250-310mm blast holes. Pit optimization software maximizes ore recovery while minimizing stripping ratios, typically achieving 3:1 to 8:1 waste:ore ratios.

• **In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC):** Semi-mobile crushing stations positioned in-pit reduce haulage distances and diesel consumption. Conveyor systems transport crushed ore to processing facilities, reducing operating costs by 20-30% compared to truck haulage. This technology is particularly effective for deep pits and long-life operations.

• **Sensor-based ore sorting:** X-ray transmission (XRT), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and near-infrared (NIR) sorting systems separate ore from waste at particle sizes from 10-300mm. These technologies can upgrade run-of-mine ore by 20-40% before entering the processing plant, reducing downstream processing costs.

• **Underground mining methods:** For high-grade or deep deposits, sublevel open stoping, cut-and-fill, or room-and-pillar methods are employed. Modern operations use automated drilling jumbos, remote-controlled loaders, and continuous monitoring systems for safety and efficiency.

• **Solution mining potential:** Experimental in-situ leaching of manganese deposits using acid or bacterial solutions remains in research phase. While technically feasible for certain deposit types, environmental and economic challenges have prevented commercial adoption.

*Summary: gravity concentration; magnetic separation; dense media separation; flotation*

• **Gravity concentration circuits:** Dense manganese oxides (4.5-5.0 g/cm³) separate efficiently from lighter gangue minerals using jigs, spirals, and shaking tables. Modern Kelsey jigs and Falcon concentrators achieve >90% recovery of +1mm manganese particles. Multi-stage gravity circuits can produce concentrates grading 45-50% Mn from feed grades of 20-30%.

• **High-intensity magnetic separation (HIMS):** Wet and dry magnetic separators operating at 10,000-20,000 gauss remove iron oxides and separate weakly magnetic manganese minerals (jacobsite, hausmannite). Modern rare-earth drum separators and SLon vertical ring separators achieve precise separation at particle sizes down to 45 microns.

• **Dense media separation (DMS):** Ferrosilicon or magnetite suspensions with specific gravities of 2.8-3.2 separate manganese ore from waste rock at coarse sizes (6-50mm). Modern DMS cyclones achieve separation efficiencies >95% with Ep values below 0.03, minimizing ore losses.

• **Froth flotation:** For fine particles (<150 microns) and carbonate ores, flotation using fatty acid collectors at pH 9-11 recovers manganese minerals. Reverse flotation removes silica and alumina impurities. Column flotation cells improve grade and recovery compared to mechanical cells, achieving concentrates with <2% SiO₂.

• **Enhanced gravity separation:** Knelson concentrators, Multi-Gravity Separators (MGS), and Mozley tables recover fine manganese particles (10-100 microns) that escape conventional gravity circuits. These technologies can recover >80% of manganese from tailings streams.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: reductive roasting; acid leaching; solvent extraction; electrowinning; crystallization*

• **Pyrometallurgical processing:** Electric arc furnaces (EAF) operating at 1500-1600°C produce ferromanganese alloys by carbothermic reduction of manganese ore. Modern submerged arc furnaces (SAF) with 40-80 MVA capacity achieve >90% manganese recovery. Oxygen-blown converters refine high-carbon ferromanganese to medium and low-carbon grades for specialty steel applications.

• **Hydrometallurgical leaching:** Sulfuric acid leaching at 80-90°C with SO₂ or organic reductants dissolves manganese from oxide ores, achieving >95% extraction. Pressure leaching in autoclaves at 150-200°C reduces processing time from hours to minutes. Bacterial leaching using Thiobacillus species offers lower-cost processing for low-grade ores.

• **Solvent extraction (SX):** Di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) in kerosene selectively extracts manganese from leach solutions at pH 2-4. Modern mixer-settler circuits achieve >99.9% manganese recovery with separation factors >1000 for Mn/Fe. Ionic liquids and novel extractants are being developed for improved selectivity.

• **Electrowinning and electrorefining:** Electrolytic cells operating at 30-35°C with current densities of 200-400 A/m² produce 99.9% pure electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) from purified sulfate solutions. Modern cells use titanium anodes and stainless steel cathodes with automated stripping systems. Energy consumption ranges from 5,500-7,000 kWh per tonne EMM.

• **Crystallization and precipitation:** Controlled crystallization produces battery-grade manganese sulfate monohydrate (>99.95% purity) through cooling, evaporation, or anti-solvent addition.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: passive treatment wetlands; manganese-oxidizing bioreactors; chemical precipitation; membrane filtration*

• **Biological manganese oxidation:** Engineered bioreactors containing manganese-oxidizing bacteria (Leptothrix, Pseudomonas) remove >95% of dissolved manganese from mine water at retention times of 24-48 hours. Biofilm-coated media provides surface area for bacterial growth while facilitating manganese oxide precipitation and collection.

• **Constructed wetlands:** Aerobic wetlands with limestone substrates and manganese-oxidizing plants (Typha, Phragmites) treat flows up to 1,000 m³/day. Multi-stage systems combining aerobic and anaerobic zones achieve <1 mg/L manganese in discharge water. Vertical flow wetlands increase oxygen transfer and reduce footprint by 50% compared to horizontal flow designs.

• **Chemical precipitation systems:** Lime dosing to pH 9.5-10.5 combined with aeration precipitates manganese hydroxides. Oxidants (permanganate, ozone, chlorine dioxide) accelerate manganese oxidation at neutral pH. Modern high-density sludge (HDS) plants produce stable precipitates with >30% solids content.

• **Advanced oxidation processes:** Catalytic oxidation using manganese-coated media (pyrolusite, MnOx-coated sand) removes manganese at pH 6.5-7.5 without chemical addition. Regeneration with permanganate or chlorine restores media capacity. These systems treat drinking water to <0.05 mg/L manganese.

• **Membrane and ion exchange technologies:** Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis remove >98% of dissolved manganese but require pretreatment to prevent fouling. Manganese-specific ion exchange resins achieve <0.01 mg/L in treated water. These technologies suit small flows or polishing applications where high-quality water is required.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
The predominant constraint for establishing US and allied manganese independence is the absence of **domestic hydrometallurgical processing and refining infrastructure** capable of producing battery-grade materials. While manganese ore could potentially be mined domestically, the lack of facilities for high-purity manganese sulfate production, electrolytic manganese metal refining, and specialty ferroalloy manufacturing means any domestic ore would require export for processing. Building these technically complex, capital-intensive facilities with the necessary environmental controls and operational expertise represents a 5-10 year development timeline and billions in investment. Until this processing gap is addressed, the US and allies will remain dependent on Asian processing capacity, particularly China which controls >90% of global manganese chemical production.
