## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: hydrometallurgical processing; battery-grade purification; domestic refining capacity*  

The primary bottleneck is **downstream processing and refining infrastructure**.  The U.S. and allied countries have essentially no facilities to process manganese ore into battery-grade chemicals or high-purity alloys ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=While%20manganese%20ore%20can%20be,S)) ([news.gm.com](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0626-supplychain.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%2C%20GM%20will,kind%20in%20the%20United%20States)).  For example, GM and Element 25 only recently announced plans to build the first US plant to produce battery-grade manganese sulfate (high-purity MnSO₄·H₂O) by 2025 ([news.gm.com](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0626-supplychain.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%2C%20GM%20will,kind%20in%20the%20United%20States)).  Similarly, electrolytic manganese metal (EMM) for batteries requires ultra-pure processing (<0.1% impurities) that currently exists almost entirely outside the West.  Industry sources note that China holds around 90% of global high-purity manganese refining capacity ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=While%20manganese%20ore%20can%20be,S)), effectively controlling the supply of both battery-grade sulfate and electrolytic metal.  On the ferroalloy side, producing specialty low- and medium-carbon ferromanganese alloys also requires modern electric-arc furnaces (EAFs) and refining converters.  In practice, manganese alloys are produced by smelting at ~1500–1600 °C in electric furnaces ([www.eramet.com](https://www.eramet.com/en/activities/manganese/manganese-alloys/#:~:text=Manganese%20alloys%20are%20produced%20by,of%20which%20are%20electric%20furnaces)).  Building such EAF-based alloy plants with controlled atmosphere capabilities requires billions in investment and new expertise.  

These bottleneck facilities are technically complex: hydrometallurgical plants need intensive solvent‐extraction (SX) circuits to achieve >99.95% pure Mn sulfate for cathode use, and high‐capacity electrowinning lines must reliably strip <0.1% impurities.  The combination of high capital cost, specialized chemical handling (e.g. strong acids and extractants), stringent environmental controls, and lack of local engineering experience adds to the challenge.  In short, without new battery‐grade refinery plants and alloy furnaces, any manganese ore mined domestically would still have to be exported for processing.  Addressing this midstream gap involves a long lead time (5–10+ years) and hundreds of millions in approvals and construction ([news.gm.com](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0626-supplychain.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%2C%20GM%20will,kind%20in%20the%20United%20States)) ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=While%20manganese%20ore%20can%20be,S)).  Until then, US/allied production remains tied to imported, refined materials.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: US: 0 tons/year; Australia: 6.5 Mt ore (~3.0 Mt Mn) per year; Other allies: negligible*  

The United States currently produces virtually **no manganese ore** domestically – the last US manganese mine closed decades ago – so production is 0 t/yr and the industry is 100% import‐reliant ([data.usgs.gov](https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/data/USGS%3A65b7d805d34e36a39045b4ea#:~:text=Spatial%20Extent%20of%20Data)).  For example, USGS data show “net import reliance” at 100% for manganese in recent years (no domestic output) ([data.usgs.gov](https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/data/USGS%3A65b7d805d34e36a39045b4ea#:~:text=Spatial%20Extent%20of%20Data)).  Proposed projects exist but none are yet in production; e.g. Electric Metals’ (formerly Element 25) Emily Project in Minnesota is in exploration stage (drill results show high-grade intercepts up to ~49% Mn) ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/2981-tsx-venture/eml/143961-electric-metals-announces-high-grade-intercepts-up-to-48-5-mn-62-6-mno-1-in-first-drill-results-from-the-emily-manganese-project-minnesota-usa.html#:~:text=Drilling%20highlights%20from%20the%20first,2)), but no mining or processing capacity has been built.  Likewise, Canada has no active manganese mines.  The Woodstock (Plymouth) deposit in New Brunswick is a large resource (tens of Mt at ~10% Mn ([canadianmanganese.com](https://canadianmanganese.com/article/canadian-manganese-announces-updated-mineral-resources-estimate-for-plymouth-deposit-at-woodstock-including-mi-resource-of-56700000-tonnes-grading-10-07-manganese/#:~:text=,and%20expansion%20of%20deposit%E2%80%99s%20economic))) but remains undeveloped; there are no manganese ores being mined in North America today aside from exploration.  Other allied regions (EU, Japan, etc.) similarly lack significant manganese mining – their requirements come entirely from imports or toll-processing foreign ores.  

By contrast, **Australia** is the dominant manganese producer among US-aligned nations.  In 2023 Australian mines produced on the order of 6.5 million tonnes of ore (~3.0–3.3 Mt of contained Mn) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Australia%20contributes%20to%20global%20manganese,9mt)).  The vast majority (~87%) of that came from the GEMCO operation on Groote Eylandt ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Tropical%20cyclone%20Megan%20wreaked%20havoc,of%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20manganese%20production)), which in 2023 alone shipped about 5.9 Mt of ore (high-grade, ~45–47% Mn) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Australia%20contributes%20to%20global%20manganese,9mt)).  The remainder of Australian production came from operations like Woodie Woodie, which generated roughly 0.6 Mt of ore in 2023 ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Australia%20contributes%20to%20global%20manganese,9mt)).  (Woodie Woodie’s production is now about 0.6 Mt/yr at ~40–45% grade according to industry reports ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Australia%20contributes%20to%20global%20manganese,9mt)).)  All other US-ally producers are very small by comparison.  In summary, US/allied domestic mining: US = 0; Canada = 0; EU/Japan = ~0; Australia ≈ 6.5 Mt ore (~3.2 Mt Mn) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Tropical%20cyclone%20Megan%20wreaked%20havoc,of%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20manganese%20production)) ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Australia%20contributes%20to%20global%20manganese,9mt)).  Alloys and oxide production (federally in the US by Eramet Marietta, etc.) only process imported ore, contributing minor amounts of ferromanganese (~0.3 Mt in 2023) and no domestic high-purity Mn metal.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 1.2–1.5 million tons Mn-content/year by 2030*  

Manganese demand in the US and allied nations is overwhelmingly steel-driven (roughly 85–90% of Mn usage) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/manganese-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Manganese%20,are%20used%20to%20provide%20most)).  It is used mainly as ferroalloy (often ferrogranular or briquette Mn) in steelmaking.  For context, global crude steel production was on the order of 1.84 billion tonnes in 2022 ([worldsteel.org](https://worldsteel.org/data/world-steel-in-figures-2022/#:~:text=depending%20on%20their%20direct%20trade,4%20Mt)).  Even if US/EU/Japan together account for ~350 million tonnes of crude steel (for example, roughly 80 Mt US + 140 Mt EU + 50 Mt Japan + 80 Mt other allied mills), at typical manganese consumption rates (~7–10 kg Mn per tonne of steel) the combined Mn requirement is roughly 2.5–3.5 million tonnes of Mn content.  Allies’ share (US and core partners) of this is on the order of 1.0–1.2 million tonnes of Mn content.  (In 2022, apparent US steel consumption was ~65–70 Mt, EU ~150 Mt, Japan ~47 Mt and other allies ~40–50 Mt, implying roughly 1.0–1.2 Mt Mn content assuming ~8 kg/t.)  

Battery demand is currently a small fraction (3–5%) of US/allied Mn use, but is growing rapidly.  Next-generation Li-ion chemistries such as NMC and LMO use significant Mn in cathodes (roughly 10–20% of cathode mass) ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=China%27s%20control%20of%20global%20manganese,makers%20by%202030)).  This translates to roughly 0.1–0.2 kg Mn per kWh of battery capacity, assuming modern NMC formulations.  If allied EV battery production reaches ~500 GWh/yr by 2030 (a plausible scale given current targets), the manganese sulphate requirement would be on the order of 50,000–100,000 t Mn/yr.  Indeed, industry forecasts suggest global “battery-grade” manganese demand could rise about 15-fold to over 1.2 million tonnes per year by 2031 ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=will%20drive%20up%20demand%20for,Source%2C%20a%20utilities%20research%20firm)).  In short, by 2030 total allied manganese demand is expected to be on the order of **1.2–1.5 million tonnes of Mn metal content**, of which steel processing still accounts for ~90% but battery use may grow into the 8–10% range.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 3–4 million tons Mn-content/year, primarily from Australia*  

Looking ahead to 2030, allied supply will remain dominated by Australia, with only limited contributions from proposed new projects.  Australia’s output is currently ~6.5 Mt ore (~3.2 Mt Mn content) per year ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Australia%20contributes%20to%20global%20manganese,9mt)) and is expected to stay near that level barring disruptions.  Cyclone risks or ore depletion could cause short-term drops, as seen in 2024, but long-term forecasts still assume ~3–3.5 Mt Mn content from Australia annually.  New projects in allied countries could add a few hundred thousand tonnes by 2030 at best.  For example, Electric Metals’ Emily Project in Minnesota could hypothetically produce on the order of 50–100 kt Mn/yr if developed (the company’s drill results show high-grade zones but a mine is still years away) ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/2981-tsx-venture/eml/143961-electric-metals-announces-high-grade-intercepts-up-to-48-5-mn-62-6-mno-1-in-first-drill-results-from-the-emily-manganese-project-minnesota-usa.html#:~:text=Drilling%20highlights%20from%20the%20first,2)).  Canada’s Woodstock (Plymouth) Project has a very large resource (on the order of 56.7 Mt grading ~10% Mn ([canadianmanganese.com](https://canadianmanganese.com/article/canadian-manganese-announces-updated-mineral-resources-estimate-for-plymouth-deposit-at-woodstock-including-mi-resource-of-56700000-tonnes-grading-10-07-manganese/#:~:text=,and%20expansion%20of%20deposit%E2%80%99s%20economic))), but converting that into production could yield only on the order of 100–200 kt Mn/yr if a mine and plant were eventually built.  In Europe, Euro Manganese’s proposed Chvaletice operation in the Czech Republic aims to produce about 98,600 t/yr of battery-grade MnSO₄ and 14,900 t/yr of electrolytic Mn metal by ~2030 ([www.miningweekly.com](https://www.miningweekly.com/article/chvaletice-manganese-project-czechia-update-2024-08-23#:~:text=Saleable%20product%20includes%202.5,purity%20electrolytic)), which is a significant pilot-scale addition but still <0.1 Mt/yr.  Even optimistically, all known new projects would supply only a few hundred thousand tonnes of Mn content per year by 2030.  Thus allied countries will remain structurally short by roughly 800,000–1,000,000 t/yr of content relative to demand.  The shortfall will continue to be filled by imports of manganese ore and products (over 2 Mt ore/yr from South Africa, Gabon, etc. in recent years) and by dedicated toll-processing of imported concentrates.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: hyperspectral imaging; airborne geophysics; AI-driven targeting; geochemical vectoring*  

• **Hyperspectral and multispectral imaging:** Satellite and drone hyperspectral sensors (e.g. Sentinel-2 MSI, ASTER, WorldView-3) can identify manganese oxide and carbonate minerals via their characteristic absorption features in the visible/near-IR (e.g. Mn–O band near 0.8 μm).  These tools are used to map exposed Mn-rich rocks and alteration halos at high spatial resolution (<10 m) using indices or machine-learning on multi-band imagery ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/2/113#:~:text=%5B46%5D.%20Sentinel,55%20%CE%BCm%20and)).  
• **Integrated geophysical surveys:** Airborne methods such as electromagnetics (EM) and magnetics can highlight dense, conductive Mn formations (e.g. interbedded with iron).  Ground gravity surveys also help locate massive Mn oxide bodies.  Advanced techniques like tensor gradiometry and full-wave electromagnetic inversion can probe depths >500 m to find buried manganese-bearing stratigraphy.  
• **Stream/soil geochemical sampling:** Systematic collection of surface soil or stream sediment samples analyzed by portable XRF provides rapid, on-site Mn assays.  Multi-element geochemical patterns (e.g. Mn with Fe, Ni, Co enrichments) help vector toward mineralized zones.  Water samples analyzed by ICP-MS or ICP-OES can detect Mn dispersion halos (Mn in water often indicates nearby oxide deposits).  
• **LiDAR/photogrammetry:** High-resolution airborne or drone LiDAR generates detailed topographic models to reveal subtle outcrop structures and gossans over bedrock.  Combined with photogrammetric orthomosaics, these data produce 3D geological models to target fissures and outcrops where manganese minerals may accumulate (especially in old stopes or ironstone ridges).  
• **AI-driven targeting:** Machine learning and AI frameworks ingest geological maps, geochemical data, geophysical anomalies, remote-sensing indices, and drilling databases to generate mineral prospectivity scores.  For example, deep neural networks trained on known deposit footprints can reduce target search areas by ~80–90% while retaining high discovery probability.  Such data-driven systems have been shown to extract subtle orebody signatures beyond classical mapping methods.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: open-pit mining; in-pit crushing; ore sorting; selective mining*  

• **Open-pit mining:** Shovel-and-truck mining is standard for large manganese deposits (typically oxide ores).  Modern pits use 200–400 t haul trucks, hydraulic shovel excavators, and rotary drills for blastholes (commonly 250–310 mm diameter).  Digital pit optimization tools (Lerchs–Grossmann or dynamic pushback software) are applied to maximize oxide recovery while controlling waste stripping (typical waste:ore ratios are on the order of 3:1 to 8:1 in gently dipping deposits).  
• **In-pit crushing and conveying (IPCC):** Many new large mines install semi-mobile crushers inside the pit to reduce hauling.  In-pit crushers break ore to conveyor-feed size directly in the mine, after which fixed conveyors (often over 1–2 km long) transport crushed ore to the plant.  This can cut diesel truck usage by ~20–30% and lower operating costs, especially in deep or long-distance scenarios.  
• **Ore sorting and pre-concentration:** Sensor-based sorters (X-ray transmission (XRT), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), near-infrared (NIR)) are used on run-of-mine ore to reject waste early.  By separating high-density manganese fragments (typically >10–300 mm) from low-grade gangue, pre-concentration sorting can boost feed grade by up to 30% and increase overall recovery, reducing processing costs.  South African and Australian Mn operations have reported +20–40% Mn grade improvement with modern ore sorters.  
• **Selective and underground mining:** High-grade manganese mines may use selective extraction to target pockets of massive ore.  Shallow underground methods like room-and-pillar or cut-and-fill have been employed in some deposits.  Automation (robotic drill jumbos, tele-remote loaders) and modern safety monitoring (geotechnical sensors, LiDAR scanning) improve productivity and safety in these smaller-scale operations.  
• **Innovative techniques (research stage):** Concepts like in-situ leaching of manganese are under investigation.  For example, acid or bioleaching of sedimentary Mn ores has been tested in pilot studies, but practical challenges (low permeability, low recovery rates, environmental control) have so far kept this from commercial use.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: gravity concentration; magnetic separation; dense media; flotation*  

• **Gravity concentration:** Many Mn ores (especially higher grade oxides) are amenable to gravity separation.  Industrial circuits use equipment like Kelsey jigs, spiral concentrators, and Falcon centrifuges to recover dense Mn oxide minerals from lighter quartz/limonite gangue.  For example, Kelsey jigs operating on +1 mm ore can achieve >90% Mn recovery in the coarse fraction.  Multi-stage gravity circuits often upgrade 20–30% feed grade ore to ~45–50% Mn concentrate before further processing, significantly reducing mill throughput.  
• **Magnetic separation:** After crushing, weakly magnetic manganese oxides (e.g. jacobsite, hausmannite) can be separated from non-magnetic gangue.  High-intensity magnetic separators (HIMS) or rare-earth drum magnets (operating up to ~15,000–20,000 gauss) remove iron oxide inclusions or magnetic contaminants.  Modern separators (e.g. SLon vertical ring magnets) can process fine particles down to 45 μm.  This stage helps produce a cleaner Mn feed by rejecting residual magnetite or hematite.  
• **Dense media separation (DMS):** For coarse particles (typically 6–50 mm), dense media cyclones or baths can separate Mn ore from waste via specific gravity.  A slurry of ferrosilicon or magnetite (density ~2.8–3.2) allows the heavier Mn-bearing fragments (4.7–5.0 g/cm³) to sink, while lighter waste floats.  DMS units on Mn circuits routinely achieve >95% Mn recovery with separation efficiency (Ep) <0.03 when feed rock is appropriately sized.  
• **Flotation:** Finely disseminated Mn ores (e.g. carbonate-rich ores or <150 μm oxides) are recovered by froth flotation.  Aliphatic acid or hydroxamate collectors at mildly alkaline pH (9–11) selectively float manganese minerals.  Reverse flotation (floating silica and alumina) is often used as a pre-cleaner before Mn flotation.  Column flotation cells and modern reagents are reported to produce Mn concentrates with <2% SiO₂.  
• **Enhanced gravity:** For ultra-fine Mn particles (<100 μm) escaping conventional circuits, enhanced gravity devices like Knelson centrifugal concentrators or Multi-Gravity Separators (MGS) recover additional manganese.  Tailings from primary separation can be reprocessed through Knelson or shaking table stages to recover >80% of remaining Mn.  These high-tech gravity units often boost overall Mn recovery by several percent in modern plants.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: reductive roasting; acid leaching; solvent extraction; electrowinning; crystallization*  

• **Electric smelting (pyrometallurgy):** High-carbon ferromanganese and silicomanganese are produced in electric arc furnaces (EAF) at ~1500–1600 °C by carbothermic reduction of Mn ores ([www.eramet.com](https://www.eramet.com/en/activities/manganese/manganese-alloys/#:~:text=Manganese%20alloys%20are%20produced%20by,of%20which%20are%20electric%20furnaces)).  Modern submerged-arc furnaces (32–80 MVA) can recover >90% of manganese from the ore.  For specialty grades, oxygen-blowing in converters refines high-C Mn to medium/low-carbon ferroalloys.  Over 90% of current global ferroalloy output comes from such EAF-based routes.  
• **Acid leaching:** Manganese oxide ores are typically dissolved using sulfuric acid (often with a reductant added to enhance dissolution).  Atmospheric leaching at 80–90 °C can achieve >95% Mn extraction.  For higher throughput, pressure leaching in autoclaves (150–200 °C, 20–30 bar) shortens leach times drastically (minutes instead of hours).  There is also active research in bioleaching with Mn-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. _Acidithiobacillus_) to lower chemical costs for low-grade ores.  
• **Solvent extraction (SX):** Purification of the Mn sulfate solution is achieved by SX.  The most common extractant is D2EHPA (bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid) in a kerosene diluent.  Mixer–settler circuits (or modern SX contractors) strip Mn from impure acidic solutions at pH ~2–4, leaving impurities (Fe, etc.) behind.  Well-operated SX plants can recover >99.9% of manganese, typically achieving Mn/Fe separation factors >1000.  Research continues on new extractants and ionic liquids for even greater selectivity and lower losses.  
• **Electrowinning and electrorefining:** High-purity electrolytic Mn metal is produced by electrowinning from purified Mn sulfate solution.  Typical cells use titanium anodes and steel cathodes at 30–40 °C with current densities ~200–400 A/m².  The deposited electro-Mn (EMM) is >99.9% pure after stripping from cathodes.  Modern electrolytic plants consume ~5,500–7,000 kWh per tonne of product.  Secondary refining (electrorefining) can further reduce impurity levels for specialty grades.  
• **Crystallization and precipitation:** After electrowinning and purification, manganese is crystallized or precipitated into saleable products.  Cooling or evaporative crystallizers yield battery-grade MnSO₄·H₂O (>99.95% purity).  Alternatively, reactions with carbonate (to MnCO₃) or hydroxide (to Mn(OH)₂) followed by drying produce high-purity Mn precursor compounds.  Control of impurity levels (Na, Ca, Fe, etc.) is critical; well-controlled crystallizers under vacuum or anti-solvent addition are used to meet electronics and battery specs.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: passive treatment wetlands; manganese-oxidizing bioreactors; chemical precipitation; membrane treatment*  

• **Biological removal (Mn oxidation):** Engineered bioreactors use Mn-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. _Leptothrix_ spp., _Pseudomonas_ sp.) to remove dissolved Mn from mine waters.  These bacteria catalyze the oxidation of Mn²⁺ to MnO₂, which precipitates onto biofilm media.  Bench studies report >95% Mn²⁺ removal in 24–48 h across biofilters (e.g. _Leptothrix_ bioreactors achieved ~97.5% removal at pH 7.5 in ~3.5 days ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9781601/#:~:text=Biological%20oxidation%20%20,%5B73))).  Packed-bed biofilters with nutrient feeds can effectively strip Mn by cycling Mn²⁺ → Mn(IV) oxide within the reactor.  
• **Constructed wetlands:** Multi-stage passive wetland systems can polish Mn in drainage water.  Aerobic wetland cells (with limestone gravel beds) raise pH and promote Mn oxidation by native plants and bacteria.  Series of aerobic and anoxic zones (often combining surface-flow and vertical-flow cells) can treat flows of ~1000 m³/d to <1 mg/L Mn in outflow.  Resilient wetland designs have achieved >98% Mn removal at ambient temperatures by cycling water through Mn-oxidizing plant communities (e.g. cattails) and limestone-sand filter media.  
• **Chemical precipitation:** Elevating pH via lime (calcium hydroxide) dosing causes Mn²⁺ to precipitate as hydroxide or oxide.  Typical treatment raises pH to ~9–10 and provides ample aeration.  Oxidants like potassium permanganate, ozone, or chlorine dioxide are often added to catalyze conversion of Mn²⁺ to MnO₂ at neutral pH.  In practice, dosing well-oxygenated lime slurry will precipitate Mn as a gritty hydroxide that can be removed by settling or filter press.  Modern high-density sludge (HDS) reactors yield Mn sludges with ~30–40% solids that can be coagulated and dewatered for disposal.  
• **Oxidation/filtration media:** Manganese-specific filter media (pyrolusite MnO₂-granules or coated sands) oxidize Mn as water passes through.  These catalytic beds convert Mn²⁺ to insoluble forms without chemical addition.  Once exhausted (coated with Mn oxides), the media can be regenerated by backwashing with permanganate or chlorine.  Such filter systems are common in drinking water treatment to meet Mn <0.05 mg/L.  
• **Membrane and ion exchange polishing:** For very stringent requirements, nanofiltration/RO membranes or Mn-selective ion exchange resins can be used.  RO can remove >98% of Mn, though feedwater must be pre-treated to avoid fouling.  Chelating or strong-base anion exchange resins specialized for Mn achieve effluent Mn <0.01 mg/L.  These methods are generally applied as tertiary treatment (e.g. polishing a pre-sedimented stream) due to cost and nitrate/chloride sensitivity.

## Key Bottleneck summary  
The fundamental constraint is the **lack of domestic refining/refinery-scale processing** for manganese.  While US-allied nations could mine ore, they currently have no facilities to convert it into battery-grade chemicals or high-grade ferroalloys.  In practice, any Mn ore mined domestically would have to be shipped abroad (or at best to a planned plant like Element 25’s Louisiana sulfate plant) for processing ([news.gm.com](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0626-supplychain.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%2C%20GM%20will,kind%20in%20the%20United%20States)) ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=While%20manganese%20ore%20can%20be,S)).  Building indigenous Mn sulfate and EMM plants (plus larger ferroalloy furnaces) would take many years, large capital and strict permitting.  Until then, US/allied supply of battery/chemical manganese will remain dependent on overseas processing (primarily China’s) even if mining expands at home ([news.gm.com](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0626-supplychain.html#:~:text=Under%20the%20agreement%2C%20GM%20will,kind%20in%20the%20United%20States)) ([www.spglobal.com](https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2023/1/manganese-sulfate-bottleneck-looms-over-us-european-ev-manufacturers-73926378#:~:text=While%20manganese%20ore%20can%20be,S)).
