## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
US domestic manganese ore output is essentially zero in public records; the country relies on imports ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/high-purity-manganese-in-america-leading-the-clean-energy-transition/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20presently%20relies,the%20risk%20of%20supply%20disruptions)). (By contrast, US-based development projects exist: e.g. Electric Metals’ Emily Project in Minnesota [Cuyuna Range, 18.5% Mn ore grade] aims to produce ore ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/high-purity-manganese-in-america-leading-the-clean-energy-transition/#:~:text=A%20shining%20example%20in%20the,project%20brings%20several%20key%20advantages)), but no commercial output is yet recorded.)  Two small legacy US deposits (e.g. Arkansas “Bald Knob”/Whitton deposit, Nebraska) were mined historically but are inactive today. In fact, USGS notes “the United States presently relies entirely on imported manganese” ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/high-purity-manganese-in-america-leading-the-clean-energy-transition/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20presently%20relies,the%20risk%20of%20supply%20disruptions)). Canada has no active manganese mines; its Woodstock (New Brunswick) project has a large resource (56.7 Mt @~10.1% Mn ([canadianmanganese.com](https://canadianmanganese.com/article/canadian-manganese-announces-updated-mineral-resources-estimate-for-plymouth-deposit-at-woodstock-including-mi-resource-of-56700000-tonnes-grading-10-07-manganese/#:~:text=,November))) but no production.  

By contrast, allied production is dominated by Australia: in 2023 Australia produced on the order of 6–7 million tonnes of Mn ore ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=According%20to%20GlobalData%2C%20operating%20mines,9mt)). South32’s Groote Eylandt (Northern Territory) – jointly owned by South32 (60%) and Anglo American (40%) – produced ~5.9 Mt in 2023 ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=According%20to%20GlobalData%2C%20operating%20mines,9mt)). Woodie Woodie (WA, Ningxia Tianyuan ownership) added ~0.6 Mt in 2023 ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=According%20to%20GlobalData%2C%20operating%20mines,9mt)). (Other Australian mines – e.g. Butcherbird (Pilbara) and Woodie data – supply the balance.) Canada, EU/Norway, Iceland and Japan have no significant current Mn mining; any existing “production” is essentially nil. North American manganese ore production was only ~1.1 thousand metric tons in 2024 ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/manganese-ore-and-concentrate-northern-america-market-overview-2024/#:~:text=Northern%20America%27s%20Production%20of%20Manganese,Ores%20and%20Concentrates)) (virtually all from small projects or by-product recovery). For reference, IndexBox projects Northern America (US+Canada) consumption of Mn ores at ~364 kt by 2035 ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/manganese-ore-and-concentrate-northern-america-market-overview-2024/#:~:text=Driven%20by%20increasing%20demand%20for,the%20end%20of%202035%2C%20respectively)) – underscoring how paltry actual production is today.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Demand is driven overwhelmingly by steelmaking, plus a growing battery sector. Manganese is used ≥85–90% in steel alloying ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20manganese%20%E2%80%93%20used,will%20significantly%20boost%20manganese%20demand)) ([www.ferro-alloys.com](https://www.ferro-alloys.com/en/News/Details/323679#:~:text=The%20manganese%20market%20is%20inextricably,is%20not%20in%20great%20shape)); specialty applications (batteries, aluminum alloys) form a small but rising share. Allied steel output (US, Canada, EU, Japan) is on the order of 300–350 million tonnes/yr. At roughly 3–4 kg Mn per tonne of steel, this implies ~1.0–1.2 million tonnes of Mn demand for steel by 2030. By 2024, the steel and ferroalloys industries consumed >97% of Mn produced ([www.ferro-alloys.com](https://www.ferro-alloys.com/en/News/Details/323679#:~:text=The%20manganese%20market%20is%20inextricably,is%20not%20in%20great%20shape)).  

Electric vehicle (EV) and storage batteries add substantial new demand. Lithium-NMC (nickel-manganese-cobalt) cathodes currently dominate (~60% share in 2022 ([www.iea.org](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2023/trends-in-batteries?ref=evinfocus.com#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20lithium%20nickel%20manganese,a%20share%20of%20about%208))) and typically contain ~10–20% Mn by weight. With global EV battery capacity climbing and allied markets mandating EV growth, the U.S./Canadian/EU/Japan share of Mn for batteries could reach several hundred thousand tons by 2030. (For example, if ~300 GWh of NMC battery capacity were installed in allied EVs by 2030, at ~0.7 kg Mn/kWh, that would be ~210 kt Mn.) In summary, US/allies Mn demand in 2030 is likely on the order of 1.2–1.5 million tonnes: roughly 1.0–1.2 Mt for steel and ~0.2–0.3 Mt for batteries. These projections align with industry analyses that predict modest growth in steel demand and a sharp rise in battery-grade Mn need ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=Demand%20for%20manganese%20%E2%80%93%20used,will%20significantly%20boost%20manganese%20demand)) ([www.ferro-alloys.com](https://www.ferro-alloys.com/en/News/Details/323679#:~:text=The%20manganese%20market%20is%20inextricably,is%20not%20in%20great%20shape)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Even by 2030, domestic “supply” in US and allied markets will remain limited. Known upcoming projects (e.g. Emily in MN, Woodstock in NB, Euro Manganese in Europe) could together add only on the order of 0.05–0.1 Mt/yr of new ore by 2030, at best. Established allied output will still be dominated by Australia (~5–6 Mt/yr of ore by 2030, assuming full recovery post-cyclone ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/what-does-the-future-look-like-for-australian-manganese-mining/#:~:text=According%20to%20GlobalData%2C%20operating%20mines,9mt))). No significant new mines are currently expected in the EU, Canada or US by 2030. Thus, US/ally domestic supply is projected to cover only a fraction of local demand: for context, Northern America’s Mn ore market is forecast to reach ~364 kt by 2035 ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/manganese-ore-and-concentrate-northern-america-market-overview-2024/#:~:text=Driven%20by%20increasing%20demand%20for,the%20end%20of%202035%2C%20respectively)). Even Australia’s multi-million-ton output will largely feed exports. In practical terms, nearly all the 2030 supply for US and allied downstream (steel, battery) will still come via imports (e.g. from Australia, South Africa, Gabon) unless major processing capacity is built domestically ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/high-purity-manganese-in-america-leading-the-clean-energy-transition/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20presently%20relies,the%20risk%20of%20supply%20disruptions)) ([www.indexbox.io](https://www.indexbox.io/blog/manganese-ore-and-concentrate-northern-america-market-overview-2024/#:~:text=Driven%20by%20increasing%20demand%20for,the%20end%20of%202035%2C%20respectively)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Airborne/satellite imaging:** High-resolution multispectral and hyperspectral satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-2) combined with LiDAR-equipped drones are used to map terrain and identify signatures of Mn-bearing lithologies (e.g. iron formations, carbonates) ([jb-minerals.co.za](https://jb-minerals.co.za/latest-manganese-exploration-techniques-2023/#:~:text=Advanced%20Drone%20Surveys)) ([jb-minerals.co.za](https://jb-minerals.co.za/latest-manganese-exploration-techniques-2023/#:~:text=Satellite%20Imaging%20Technology)). Remote sensing can highlight vegetation stress or mineral spectra indicative of Mn oxides. Drones with LiDAR offer 3D terrain models to pinpoint anomalous outcrops ([jb-minerals.co.za](https://jb-minerals.co.za/latest-manganese-exploration-techniques-2023/#:~:text=Advanced%20Drone%20Surveys)).  
• **Geophysical surveys:** Magnetic surveys (airborne or ground) can detect buried Banded Iron Formations that often host manganese (e.g. Minnesota’s Cuyuna Range). Gravity surveys are used for dense oxide bodies. Radiometric surveys (gamma) are applied where Mn is associated with K-Ar-Th-bearing minerals. Integrated geophysical/remote data help focus drilling.  
• **Geochemical sampling & GIS:** Systematic soil and stream sediment sampling coupled with handheld XRF or portable lab analysis identifies Mn anomalies. Data integration with GIS/machine learning accelerates target ranking. (AI algorithms are increasingly applied to large geochemical/geologic databases to prioritize prospects ([jb-minerals.co.za](https://jb-minerals.co.za/latest-manganese-exploration-techniques-2023/#:~:text=AI,maintenance%20solutions%20in%20manganese%20exploration)).)  
• **AI & data analytics:** Machine-learning models assimilate disparate data (geology, geochem, geophysics, drilling) to predict favorable Mn deposits. As one report notes, “advanced algorithms and ML models can accurately pinpoint potential Mn deposits” and streamline exploration ([jb-minerals.co.za](https://jb-minerals.co.za/latest-manganese-exploration-techniques-2023/#:~:text=AI,maintenance%20solutions%20in%20manganese%20exploration)). These techniques enable much more efficient prospect targeting than manual methods.  
• **Robotic/remote sampling:** Autonomous robots and remote-controlled rigs can collect drill and trench samples in hazardous or inaccessible areas ([jb-minerals.co.za](https://jb-minerals.co.za/latest-manganese-exploration-techniques-2023/#:~:text=Robotic%20Sample%20Collection)). Robotics improve safety (e.g. sampling from steep outcrops, caves) and consistency. Automated trenching and borehole drilling are also sometimes employed to accelerate data collection in prospective belts.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-pit mining:** Bulk extraction by conventional open-pit methods (drill/blast, haul trucks, shovels) is standard for shallow Mn deposits. Large loaders (e.g. Komatsu/Hitachi excavators) and haulers (90–300 t capacity trucks) are used. Deployment of in-pit crushers and conveyor systems can improve efficiency on large deposits. For higher-grade veins, selective pit mining and trolley/tracked excavators are used.  
• **Ore beneficiation heap leaching:** For oxide Mn ores (MnO₂), sulfuric acid or ferric sulfate leaching is feasible. Recent lab studies report ~47% Mn extraction from oxide ore in 6 weeks via microbial heap leach (molasses-fed bacteria) ([www.911metallurgist.com](https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/biological-leaching-manganese-ores/#:~:text=medium%20pH,flask%20tests%20in%206%20weeks)). Similarly, acid heap-leaching (or bacterial bioleaching under microaerobic conditions) can treat low-grade Mn oxide waste. These hydrometallurgical methods are at pilot-scale (e.g. past U.S. Bureau of Mines tests) but show promise for refractory oxide ores.  
• **Underground/minor mining:** For deep or narrow deposits (e.g. polymetallic replacers), mechanized cut-and-fill or sublevel stoping can be used. Some historic US Mn mines (Arkansas, Missouri) used small-scale underground stope mining. Continuous miner machines or roadheaders may be used if economics allow. (No major new underground Mn operations are currently active in allies, though.)  
• **Emerging methods:** In-situ recovery (circulating leach) has been proposed for soluble manganese salts, but is not widely practiced. Experimental methods like No-chromium (Ecoblox) reductive bio-processing of Mn have been studied. For deep-sea nodules (manganese nodules on Pacific floor), Japan/EU have ROV prototypes, but no commercial production is expected by 2030.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Gravity concentration:** Manganese oxides (pyrolusite, psilomelane) are much denser than common gangue. Jigging, dense-medium cyclones, spirals, and shaking tables are used to separate heavy Mn minerals from lighter waste ([www.zoneding.com](https://www.zoneding.com/manganese-ore-processing.html#:~:text=key,This%20process)). These equipment cause the dense Mn to sink. Gravity circuits are highly effective for coarse Mn-DIOXIDE ore; many Mn plants (e.g. in India, Brasil) rely on jigs and spirals.  
• **Magnetic separation:** Many Mn ores contain magnetic phases (hausmannite, braunite, or hematite/goethite gangue). High-intensity magnetic separators (dry drum or wet drum) remove iron oxides and can pull out any weakly magnetic Mn minerals. As one process description notes, “magnetic separators…pull out magnetic particles…good for separating magnetic manganese minerals and removing iron impurities” ([www.zoneding.com](https://www.zoneding.com/manganese-ore-processing.html#:~:text=Mn%E2%82%83O%E2%82%84%29,Rhodochrosite)). Tailored magnetic circuits (low- or high-gradient) improve concentrate grade.  
• **Froth flotation:** For carbonate ores (rhodochrosite, rhodonite) and fine particles, froth flotation is essential. Anionic collectors (e.g. sodium oleate, fatty acid mixtures) at alkaline pH are used to float Mn-carbonates from silica and clay. ([www.scielo.org.ar](https://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?pid=S0327-07932012000100006&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=first%20step%2C%20microflotation%20tests%20in,In%20the)). Depressants like sodium silicate (“water glass”) suppress silica. Bench tests show >99% rhodochrosite recovery at pH ~11 with oleate ([www.scielo.org.ar](https://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?pid=S0327-07932012000100006&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=first%20step%2C%20microflotation%20tests%20in,In%20the)). Combined gravity-flotation circuits (e.g. rougher flotation after jigging) handle mixed ore. Modern plants may use column or mechanical cells with reagent suites tuned to the specific ore mineralogy.  
• **Flocculation and thickening:** Manganese recovery often requires dewatering steps. After flotation or gravity, slurry thickeners and filter presses remove water, producing dry Mn concentrate. Polymer flocculants are used to clarify tailings and maximize recovery of fine Mn particles. Advanced filtration (e.g. belt or pressure filters) yield high-grade cake (MnO content >40–50%). For ores with ultra-fines, enhanced gravity concentrators (Knelson) or selective flocculation may be employed ([www.zoneding.com](https://www.zoneding.com/manganese-ore-processing.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L396%20Shaking%20Tables%2C,the%20manganese%20concentrate%20and%20waste)).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Ferroalloy smelting:** Converting Mn concentrate to usable forms is typically done in electric arc furnaces. High-carbon ferromanganese (HC FeMn, ~75–80% Mn) and silicomanganese are produced by combining MnO₂ (or oxide concentrate) with iron oxide and carbon (coke) at >1500°C. Furnace off-gas CO₂ provides heat; slag(s) form with Si/Al. Medium- and low-carbon FeMn are refined further (e.g. in a sealed-oxygen converter) to strip C and adjust Mn. Alloy producers (e.g. South32, Eramet) use submerged-arc furnaces (SAF) or blast furnace converters. Sintering pre-treatment of fine ore is common to improve RF reducibility.  
• **Electrolytic Mn production:** High-purity Mn metal or MnO₂ is made via electrolysis of Mn sulfate solutions. The ore is first leached (typically with sulfuric acid) to produce MnSO₄, then purified (see below) and electrolyzed to metal Mn or to bath-grade MnO₂. This route yields Mn with <0.1% impurities, used in Mn–Zn batteries and specialty steel. (Few facilities exist in US/allies; historic examples include plants in Italy/Japan.)  
• **Hydrometallurgical purification:** For battery-grade Mn chemicals, high-purity Mn sulfate monohydrate is required. Processes involve: leaching Mn ore with H₂SO₄, oxidative removal of Fe/Cr (by H₂O₂ oxidation to precipitate hydroxides), and solvent extraction or ion exchange to segregate Mn from Ni/Co/Fe (often using D2EHPA or similar reagents). The purified Mn sulfate can then be crystallized. Research (and pilot plants) focus on achieving >99.9% Mn purity. In emerging projects, e.g. USA’s Emily Project plans to integrate acid leaching with SX to produce MnSO₄ for batteries.  
• **Chemical precipitation:** A cost-effective final step is self-pyrolysis or precipitation. For example, adding KMnO₄ or H₂O₂ to a sulfate solution precipitates MnO₂, which can be calcined to cathode-grade powder. Electrochemical deposition (electrowinning) from Mn sulfate also produces Mn metal/billets. Purification down to battery specs involves tight pH control and sequential precipitation (e.g. Fe, Ca removal). These wet-chemistry steps are critical tech gaps for domestic supply.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Microbial oxidation/bio-filtration:** Certain bacteria (e.g. *Leptothrix*, *Stenotrophomonas*) and fungi can oxidize soluble Mn(II) to Mn(IV) oxides, precipitating it out. Cultured biofilms in filter beds (e.g. gravel bioreactors) can remove >90% of Mn from mine water. For instance, Mn-oxidizing bacteria immobilized on sorbents have achieved ~95% Mn removal in 48 h when combined with H₂O₂-treated biochar ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/12/2411#:~:text=,2%7D%2C%20which%20enables%20it)). This approach mimics natural attenuation and is used in passive treatment systems.  
• **Biosorption:** Biological materials (microalgae, bacteria, agricultural waste gels) bind dissolved Mn. Studies show *Pediastrum duplex* algae can sorb and oxidize Mn from contaminated mine effluent ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6861300/#:~:text=Remediation%20of%20Manganese,Scale%20Feasibility%20Study)). Industrially, packed towers or ponds with Mn-sorbing biomass can be implemented; when saturated, biomass is harvested and Mn recovered. Genetically engineered or enriched strains with high Mn uptake are an active research area ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6861300/#:~:text=Remediation%20of%20Manganese,Scale%20Feasibility%20Study)).  
• **Chemical oxidation and settling:** Raising pH (lime or caustic addition) and aeration (O₂) drives Mn(II) to Mn(IV) hydroxides (removable solids). Commercial Mn-polluted water treatments often use sequential neutralization and aeration tanks, followed by sedimentation. Adding permanganate (KMnO₄) can “co-precipitate” lighter Mn species. These wet chemical steps are standard for Mn removal from wastewater.  
• **Constructed wetlands/active beds:** Wetland systems with oxygen-rich zones (and Mn-oxidizing plants/bacteria) gradually remove Mn from discharge streams. Similar to bio-filtration, these rely on natural oxidation and sorption (peat or limestone beds). They are low-cost, though require large area and long residence times; typically used where discharge rates are modest.  
• **Electrochemical treatment:** Advanced methods (electrocoagulation) use sacrificial iron electrodes to raise pH and precipitate Mn. Or membrane systems (ion exchange/ultrafiltration) strip trace Mn from water. These are more expensive, reserved for high-value reuse water or stringent effluent standards.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The chief bottleneck is **processing ore into high-purity end materials**. Even if new Mn mines open, the US/Allies currently lack downstream refining capacity (e.g. inert-atmosphere converters, battery-grade sulfate plants). In practice, the entire allied supply chain today relies on foreign smelting and refining ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/high-purity-manganese-in-america-leading-the-clean-energy-transition/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20presently%20relies,the%20risk%20of%20supply%20disruptions)). Thus, the critical bottleneck is development of hydrometallurgical or extraction technologies domestically: for example, solvent-extraction circuitry to purify Mn sulfate, or a domestic electric-arc furnace producing high-carbon FeMn. Without such facilities, domestically mined Mn cannot reach battery or specialty markets.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In summary, the predominant constraint is the absence of **local Mn purification/refining infrastructure**. US and allied projects must not only mine ore, but also build processing plants (acid-leach, SX, electrowinning) to yield battery-grade manganese. At present all US-produced Mn feeds would need to be refined abroad ([discoveryalert.com.au](https://discoveryalert.com.au/high-purity-manganese-in-america-leading-the-clean-energy-transition/#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20presently%20relies,the%20risk%20of%20supply%20disruptions)). Until domestic alloying or sulfate-production plants exist, new mines alone cannot create a self-sufficient Mn supply chain.
