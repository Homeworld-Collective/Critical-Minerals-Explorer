## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
The United States has no active arsenic mines and has produced 0 t/yr in recent decades ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=dosages%2C%20arsenic%20is%20toxic,Arsenic%20has)). Allied producers are similarly minimal.  For example, **Japan** (which refines arsenic compounds) exported ~31.9 t in 2022 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2022/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280480#:~:text=Reporter%20%20,3%2C994.50)) (implying similar domestic output), and the **EU** (mostly the Netherlands and Germany) exported ~70.6 t in 2022 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2022/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280480#:~:text=Reporter%20%20,3%2C994.50)).  Other allies (Canada, Australia, Norway, Iceland) have no primary arsenic production; any arsenic occurs only as trace byproducts in base-metal or gold deposits.  In aggregate, current US/allied production is on the order of **0–100 t/year** (mostly from Japan/EU refining), far below global output (~61,000 t in 2022 ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=national%20supply%20disruptions,applications%20in%20telecommunications%20and%20light))).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Allied demand is expected to rise with electronics and specialty uses. The **semiconductor** industry (GaAs/GaInAs devices) will likely dominate future demand.  Gallium arsenide wafer production is forecast to expand in the 2020s (Gallium arsenide wafers contain ~50% arsenic by mass), implying **thousands of tons** of As needed globally by 2030.  Electronics/LEDs currently account for ~8% of arsenic use ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=agreement%20in%202003%20to%20ban,applications%20in%20telecommunications%20and%20light)), but as U.S. and allied chip fabs multiply, demand for ultra-high-purity arsenic could reach **2,000–4,000 t/yr** by 2030 (spanning GaAs chips, LEDs, and defense semiconductors).  Other uses (lead-acid battery alloys, specialty glasses, minor agrochemicals or CCA wood preservatives) are smaller or declining in allied markets.  Overall, we project US/allied arsenic demand on the order of *a few thousand metric tons per year by 2030*, driven by high-tech industries (GaAs RF/microwave devices, photonics, etc.) ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=agreement%20in%202003%20to%20ban,from%20dusts%20and%20residues%20produced)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Without new major mines, allied supply will remain very limited.  Likely supply sources by 2030 include existing refinery byproducts and increased recycling.  For instance, continued arsenic capture at Japanese smelters (~30–40 t/yr) and any EU production (~70–100 t/yr) could sum to **100–150 t/yr**.  Enhanced recycling of GaAs scrap and reclamation of chromated-wood treatment wastes might add only tens of tons.  Even with aggressive recycling, domestic supply is projected in the **hundreds of tons per year** – an order of magnitude *below* demand.  Thus US/allied production will satisfy only a small fraction of needs, necessitating large imports from major producers (e.g. from China, Peru, Japan, Morocco) ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=national%20supply%20disruptions,applications%20in%20telecommunications%20and%20light)) ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2022/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280480#:~:text=Reporter%20%20,3%2C994.50)).

• Market commentary: Allied electronics sector growth indicates demand in the few ×10^3 t range by 2030 ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=agreement%20in%202003%20to%20ban,from%20dusts%20and%20residues%20produced)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geochemical Surveys:** Systematic soil/rock sampling and assays (often using portable XRF) to detect As anomalies. Field portable XRF enables near-real-time screening for arsenic in rocks and soils during exploration ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375674217305551#:~:text=In%20the%20last%20thirty%20years%2C,data%20density%20compatible%20with%20geostatistics)). Unusual As in stream sediments or soils can flag concealed sulphide mineralization.  
• **Geophysical Methods:** Induced-polarization (IP) and resistivity surveys target the electric properties of arsenic-bearing sulfides. Massive arsenopyrite zones show high chargeability/low-resistivity signatures ([www.scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=104088#:~:text=geological%20structures%20of%20occurrence%20of,disseminated%20mineral%20deposit%20%2039)). Combined geophysics (IP, magnetics, gravity) helps outline arsenic-rich ore bodies, especially under cover.  
• **Remote Sensing & Mapping:** Airborne hyperspectral or thermal infrared surveys can identify surface alteration minerals (e.g. orpiment, realgar) associated with As. Detailed geological mapping highlights known arsenic-host lithologies (e.g. Carlin-style siliciclastic rocks, ore skarns). Trained interdisciplinary teams apply GIS and machine learning to correlate pathfinder elements (As with Au, Hg, Sb, Tl) in exploration models.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Mining & Concentration:** Conventional hard-rock mining (open-pit or underground) is used where arsenic-rich ores (arsenopyrite-bearing gold or copper deposits) exist. Crushed ore is often flotation-processed to concentrate sulfides – arsenic minerals can be separated out (or sent for recovery) to prevent contamination of downstream processes. Many gold/copper operations use flotation to reject arsenic-bearing minerals (e.g. arsenopyrite, enargite).  
• **Roasting & Smelting:** High-temperature oxidation (roasting) of As-bearing concentrates (e.g. arsenopyrite, enargite) converts arsenic to volatile As₂O₃.  For example, smelting FeAsS (arsenopyrite) at ~650–700 °C under oxidizing conditions:  
  > FeAsS → FeS + As_(vapor)  (As vapor condenses as solid) ([chem.libretexts.org](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Main_Group_Elements_%28Barron%29/06%3A_Group_13/6.12%3A_Electronic_Grade_Gallium_Arsenide#:~:text=Arsenic%20is%20obtained%20commercially%20by,sub%7D%20%3D%20613%20%C2%B0C%29%2C%20%286.12.1)).  
  This volatilized As is then collected as arsenic trioxide (calcine). Even low-pressure, Pb-catalyzed distillation (heating AsS with Pb, followed by sublimation) is used industrially ([chem.libretexts.org](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Main_Group_Elements_%28Barron%29/06%3A_Group_13/6.12%3A_Electronic_Grade_Gallium_Arsenide#:~:text=Arsenic%20is%20obtained%20commercially%20by,sub%7D%20%3D%20613%20%C2%B0C%29%2C%20%286.12.1)).  
• **Reducing Roasting/Dust Treatment:** Innovative methods process arsenic-laden dust. For instance, reduction roasting of copper smelter dust with natural gas (or CO) has been shown to extract ~99% of arsenic into a separable phase ([sustainenvironres.biomedcentral.com](https://sustainenvironres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s42834-024-00228-8#:~:text=laboratory%20installation%20and%20technique%20for,5%7D%2C%20and%20temperature%20500%C2%A0%C2%B0C)). This can separate As(III, V) from lead/zinc sulfates in dusts.  
• **Hydrometallurgy/Bioleaching:** Research is exploring leaching of arsenic via acid or bacteria. Autotrophic acidophiles (Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans) can bio-oxidize arsenopyrite, gradually leaching As into solution ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4591/67/1/60#:~:text=latter%20property%20strictly%20worsens%20bioleaching,to%20dissolve%20arsenopyrite%20with%20increasing)). Such bioleaching (with supplemental energy sources) has been demonstrated on lab-scale Fe–As concentrates.  Similarly, acidic sulphuric or ferric chloride leaches can dissolve arsenic from roasted calcine or tailings, though safeguards are needed.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Flue Gas Capture:** Modern furnaces and roasters use cyclones and electrostatic precipitators to collect As₂O₃ dust from off-gases. Advanced designs (e.g. staged-wick baghouse or cyclonic crystallizers) trap arsenic vapors. For example, a patented Chinese process oxidizes As to As₂O₃ gas at ~500–550 °C, then immediately quenches and crystallizes it to micron-sized powder in a particulate collector ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN101412538A/en#:~:text=The%20invention%20discloses%20a%20method,particle)). This yields a high-purity arsenic trioxide product while controlling emissions.  
• **Chemical Scrubbing:** Alkaline scrubbing (lime/limestone slurry) is widely used. Calcium-based sorbents (CaO, Ca(OH)₂, dolomite) react with As₂O₃ in flue gas to form insoluble calcium arsenate compounds ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c00505#:~:text=the%20quartz%20retort%20in%20a,removal%20efficiency)). Studies show calcined limestone/dolomite are very effective, removing >90% of As_gas under scrubber conditions ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c00505#:~:text=the%20quartz%20retort%20in%20a,removal%20efficiency)). Such solid arsenate sludge is then filtered out.  
• **Adsorption & Precipitation:** In aqueous streams, arsenic can be separated by adsorbents or flocculants. Iron- or aluminum-hydroxide suspensions (added as FeCl₃/Al₂(SO₄)₃) precipitate As(V) as iron/Al arsenate. Activated alumina and granular ferric hydroxide adsorb dissolved arsenic effectively.  In gas phase, mixing sorbents (e.g. activated carbon, fly-ash catalysts) can capture As by chemisorption, though Ca-based media are preferred for cost.  
• **Solvent Extraction/Distillation:** At pilot scale, liquid–liquid extraction of arsenic complexes has been demonstrated, but is not common industrially. Instead, traditional distillation of solid arsenic trioxide (repeated sublimation) serves as both separation and purification (see next section).  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Sublimation/Distillation:** Crude As₂O₃ (often mixed with impurities) is purified by sublimation. Historical processes include combining arsenic oxide with molten lead (sulfur preferentially bonds to Pb), then subliming the As at ~614 °C ([chem.libretexts.org](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Main_Group_Elements_%28Barron%29/06%3A_Group_13/6.12%3A_Electronic_Grade_Gallium_Arsenide#:~:text=The%20arsenic%20thus%20obtained%20is,is%20formed%20by%20zone%20refining)). The sublimed arsenic is condensed as a fine metal or oxide. Impurities (S, metals) remain behind. Repeated sublimation cycles yield highly pure As₂O₃ or As.  
• **Charcoal Reduction:** Arsenic trioxide collected from flues can be reduced to elemental As using carbon (coke or charcoal) at 700–800 °C ([chem.libretexts.org](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Main_Group_Elements_%28Barron%29/06%3A_Group_13/6.12%3A_Electronic_Grade_Gallium_Arsenide#:~:text=The%20arsenic%20thus%20obtained%20is,is%20formed%20by%20zone%20refining)). The product is impure metallic As, which is then further purified.  
• **Zone Refining:** The ultimate step for electronic-grade arsenic. The already-pure As metal is melted and slowly zone-refined through a controlled temperature gradient.  This segregates trace impurities, yielding arsenic ≥99.9999% purity ([chem.libretexts.org](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Main_Group_Elements_%28Barron%29/06%3A_Group_13/6.12%3A_Electronic_Grade_Gallium_Arsenide#:~:text=oxide%20%28As_,is%20formed%20by%20zone%20refining)). Semiconductor manufacturers (e.g. for GaAs wafers) require such “6N” purity; zone-refining fulfills that need.  
• **Conversion to Electronic Precursors:** For GaAs or arsenide doping, ultra-high purity arsine (AsH₃) or other compounds are used.   Sophisticated processes (e.g. ZnAs alloy + H₂SO₄ to generate crude arsine, followed by gas-phase purification) produce “6N” arsine or GaAs feedstocks, but are proprietary.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Phytoremediation:** Hyperaccumulating plants (e.g. *Pteris vittata*, the brake fern) are used to clean As-contaminated media. Studies show that *P. vittata* can remove >90% of dissolved As from water within weeks ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/9/936#:~:text=Pteris%20plants%20per%20container%20of,root%20density%20were%20reused%2C%20one)).  In one pilot, four brake ferns in a 30 L system lowered 130 ppb As to <10 ppb in 3 weeks ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/11/9/936#:~:text=Pteris%20plants%20per%20container%20of,root%20density%20were%20reused%2C%20one)). Such ferns also draw As from soil and dispose it in fronds that can be harvested. This “green remediation” is scalable and low-cost where climate permits.  
• **Adsorptive Filtration:** In situ arsenic removal from water can use granular iron or iron-based media.  Permeable reactive barriers (PRBs) filled with zero-valent iron have been demonstrated to remove ~99.5% of dissolved As under flow conditions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20088207/#:~:text=experiments%20showed%20an%20effective%20removal,would%20be%20required%20for%20efficient)).  Iron filings/steel wool intercept a groundwater flow and oxidize/adsorb arsenic (forming ferric arsenate), effectively blocking contamination plumes. Similarly, engineered filter beds of granular ferric hydroxide or nano-Fe particles can polish drinking water to <10 ppb.  
• **Chemical Treatments:** Traditional waterworks methods (coagulation/filtration) use ferric or alum coagulants to precipitate arsenic. Arsenic adsorption onto iron oxyhydroxides (in situ or ex situ) is a routine treatment. For soils, adding amendments (iron oxides, phosphates or lime) can immobilize As as low-solubility minerals.  
• **Bioremediation:** Certain microbes oxidize As(III) to As(V), which is easier to remove by adsorption/precipitation. Likewise, sulfate-reducing bacteria can convert As into insoluble or volatile forms. Engineered wetlands combining plant uptake and microbial action have been piloted for arsenic plume attenuation.  (These biotechnologies are still emerging but offer sustainable cleanup of arsenic tailings and acid-mine drainage.)

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The primary bottleneck is the lack of domestic ore and large-scale recovery processes. No significant arsenic deposits have been discovered in US/allied territories, so production must rely on small byproduct streams or recycling.  Moreover, industry practice is to **discard** most arsenic-containing residues rather than recover them (e.g. copper/gold smelter dusts are typically landfilled) ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=dosages%2C%20arsenic%20is%20toxic,Arsenic%20has)). Although laboratory methods (e.g. staged roast-to-As₂O₃ processes ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN101412538A/en#:~:text=The%20invention%20discloses%20a%20method,particle)) or bioleaching) exist, they are not widely implemented commercially. In effect, there is no single transformative technology in allied hands: without economically viable mining or effective arsenic recovery infrastructure, domestic supply remains a tiny fraction of demand.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In sum, U.S./allied production is constrained by **geology and recovery**, not purification. The region lacks major arsenic ores, and standard mining outputs (Cu/Au concentrates) yield only trace As which is not routinely exploited.  As the SME briefing notes, arsenic “is generally not recovered” from smelter wastes ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=dosages%2C%20arsenic%20is%20toxic,Arsenic%20has)).  Thus, even with perfect refining (zone refining can achieve 6N purity ([chem.libretexts.org](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Chemistry_of_the_Main_Group_Elements_%28Barron%29/06%3A_Group_13/6.12%3A_Electronic_Grade_Gallium_Arsenide#:~:text=oxide%20%28As_,is%20formed%20by%20zone%20refining))), there is simply little raw arsenic to process. The inability to economically extract arsenic from existing ore/dust streams is the bottleneck that underpins allied supply shortfalls ([www.smenet.org](https://www.smenet.org/What-We-Do/Technical-Briefings/The-Role-of-Arsenic-in-the-Mining-Industry#:~:text=dosages%2C%20arsenic%20is%20toxic,Arsenic%20has)) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN101412538A/en#:~:text=The%20invention%20discloses%20a%20method,particle)).
