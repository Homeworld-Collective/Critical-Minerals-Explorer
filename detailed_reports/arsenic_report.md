## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Lack of primary ore deposits; absence of commercial byproduct recovery infrastructure*  

The United States and its allies have essentially no primary arsenic ore production and minimal byproduct recovery.  For example, the U.S. Geological Survey notes that arsenic trioxide and arsenic metal “have not been produced in the United States since 1985” ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=159%E3%80%81v%20ARSENIC,Arsenic%20trioxide%20was%20pre)), and that “no arsenic was recovered domestically from arsenic-containing residues and dusts” in U.S. smelters ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=168%E3%80%81t%20boards%2Crelays%2Cand%20switches%20may%20contain,Import%20So)).  Arsenic is generated only as a byproduct of copper, gold or lead smelting, but because of its high toxicity most companies stabilize and dispose of arsenic in waste streams rather than recover it ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=processing%20copper%20and%20gold,water%20and%20soil%20as%20a)) ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=168%E3%80%81t%20boards%2Crelays%2Cand%20switches%20may%20contain,Import%20So)).  Major producers like Chile and Peru have faced public outcry over arsenic in mine waste, whereas China has built a robust arsenic recovery industry and in 2022 supplied ~95% of all U.S. arsenic metal imports ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=outcry%20news,arsenic%20metal%20imports)).  In the U.S. and allied regions, stringent environmental regulations (e.g. EPA and EU limits on arsenic emissions/wastes) and low market prices mean there is little economic incentive to install arsenic recovery in copper and gold refineries ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=processing%20copper%20and%20gold,water%20and%20soil%20as%20a)) ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=159%E3%80%81v%20ARSENIC,Arsenic%20trioxide%20was%20pre)).  As a result, even though processes such as roasting or leaching of arsenic-bearing concentrates are technically feasible, they have not been deployed at scale in the West.  In short, geology (no large domestic arsenic deposits) and economics (high compliance costs) combine to leave domestic arsenic supply negligible relative to demand.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: <100 tons/year arsenic trioxide equivalent*  

There is effectively no arsenic production in the U.S. or allied countries today.  By U.S. statute arsenic trioxide and arsenic metal have not been produced domestically since 1985 ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=159%E3%80%81v%20ARSENIC,Arsenic%20trioxide%20was%20pre)).  Any arsenic recovered from mining is treated as a waste; U.S. data report zero byproduct arsenic recovery ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=168%E3%80%81t%20boards%2Crelays%2Cand%20switches%20may%20contain,Import%20So)).  Similarly, Canada, Australia, and other allies produce arsenic-bearing copper and gold concentrates but do not have commercial arsenic smelters or refineries.  Countries like Japan and Germany have refining capacity for imported arsenic compounds, but all feedstocks are imported.  For example, CSIS notes that Japan “possesses substantial technical know-how to produce high-purity arsenic metal” from imported raw materials ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=enough%20as%20a%20resource%2C%20and,supply%20in%20time%20to%20avert)).  In practice all U.S. arsenic required for industrial use is imported.  USGS trade data show that in 2022 about 54–57% of U.S. arsenic trioxide imports came from China and 35–39% from Morocco (with only small shares from Belgium or other countries) ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L898%20169%E3%80%81urces,Tariff%3AItem%20Number)).  Allied consumption of arsenic is modest; even including electronics, speciality alloys, and residual uses, total U.S./allied demand today is on the order of only a few thousand tonnes per year, almost all of which is satisfied by imports.  In summary, domestic production (recovery) in US/allies is essentially zero, certainly less than 100 t/yr (trioxide-equivalent), compared to world output measured in tens of thousands of tonnes ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=159%E3%80%81v%20ARSENIC,Arsenic%20trioxide%20was%20pre)) ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L898%20169%E3%80%81urces,Tariff%3AItem%20Number)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 1,000–2,000 tons/year arsenic trioxide equivalent*  

Arsenic demand in the U.S. and allied nations is driven largely by high-tech uses and is expected to grow moderately by 2030.  The largest potential driver is the gallium–arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor industry.  High-purity arsenic metal is used in GaAs crystal growth (GaAs is roughly 52% arsenic by mass).  CSIS notes that GaAs devices for 5G, RF communications, defense and LEDs remain important and that demand is projected to rise through 2030 ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=to%20grow%20over%20the%20coming,forecast%20to%20%2060%20drive)).  While precise figures are scarce, industry analysts estimate that the global GaAs/III-V compound semiconductor market uses on the order of 50–100 t/yr of ultra-high-purity arsenic (four- to six-nine–N grade).  If U.S. and allied GaAs fabs expand under semiconductor subsidies (e.g. the CHIPS Act), allied GaAs fabs could consume on the order of hundreds of tonnes of arsenic per year.  

Other uses of arsenic in allied markets are relatively small or stable/declining.  Arsenic additions to lead alloys and specialty glasses account for perhaps a few hundred tonnes per year globally; U.S./EU uses in these categories are likely <200 t/yr.  Major legacy uses (wood preservatives, herbicides/insecticides, animal feed additives) have been largely phased out in the U.S./EU under environmental regulations.  For example, U.S. imports of chromated copper arsenate (CCA) wood preservatives dropped sharply after restrictions in the 2000s, and many arsenic pesticides are restricted or banned.  USGS data indicate that as of 2022 roughly 45% of global arsenic consumption was in agrochemicals and 29% in wood treatment ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=165%E3%80%81g%20uses%20of%20arsenic%20were,4%2C600%20Total%206%2C470%207%2C440%208%2C270)), but these uses are mostly outside the allied market.  By contrast, fine chemical uses (e.g. GaAs semiconductors, specialty electronics) grew to about 8% of national U.S. consumption ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=165%E3%80%81g%20uses%20of%20arsenic%20were,4%2C600%20Total%206%2C470%207%2C440%208%2C270)) and are expected to continue their steady growth.  Overall, we project U.S./allied arsenic demand by 2030 in the range of 1,000–2,000 t/yr (trioxide-equivalent) – driven principally by GaAs and advanced electronic materials, with modest contributions from traditional industrial uses.  This is on the order of only a few percent of the current world market.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 100–200 tons/year from byproduct recovery and recycling*  

Without new mining or dedicated producers, U.S./ally arsenic supply will remain very limited relative to demand.  The only plausible sources are increased recovery from industrial sources and recycling.  One option is installing arsenic capture at existing copper/gold smelters.  For example, if Roaster or leach circuits at large refineries were retrofitted to condense As₂O₃ from flue dusts (using modern fluidized-bed roasters and bag filters), they could theoretically recover tens of tonnes more arsenic per year.  Some process studies suggest >95% removal of arsenic from concentrate via roasting ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/4/558?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=complex%20chemical%20reaction%20process,The%20main%20equilibrium%20reaction%20can)), but no such circuits currently operate in U.S./ally smelters.  If economic incentives/construction subsidies appeared, a handful of smelters might recover on the order of 50–100 t/yr by 2030.  

Another source is refining imported raw arsenic.  Japan and EU countries (Belgium, Germany) maintain some refining capacity.  Currently these facilities consume imported arsenic concentrates or compounds and produce specialty arsenic products.  Assuming they continue operating, they might process roughly 100 t/yr of arsenic trioxide or metal (at most) by 2030.  

Recycling is another minor source.  GaAs device fabrication generates some scrap and off-spec ingots.  Emerging processes (e.g. sulfurization + vacuum evaporation or pyrolysis) can recover arsenic from GaAs waste.  Laboratory studies report arsenic recoveries ~80–90% from shredded GaAs scraps ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b02962#:~:text=importantly%2C%20the%20environmental%20requirements%20are,3%7D.%20This%20research)).  If scaled, GaAs fab scrap recycling might return on the order of 10–20 t/yr of arsenic by 2030.  

Additional small supplies could come from remediation of contaminated waste streams.  For example, treating arsenic-laden industrial wastewater (from semiconductor or mining sites) via enhanced coagulation/adsorption could capture arsenic.  Zero-valent iron permeable barriers and iron oxide sorbents can remove >95% of arsenic from groundwater and concentrate it as solids.  Such remediation efforts might yield on the order of 20–30 t/yr of immobilized arsenic byproducts by 2030 (if aggressively pursued).  

In total, these potential sources – improved smelter byproduct recovery (~50–100 t), refining of imports (~100 t), electronic scrap recycling (~10–20 t), and waste remediation (~20–30 t) – sum to on the order of 100–200 t/yr of arsenic supply by 2030 in the US/allies.  This remains an order of magnitude below the projected demand.  The supply shortfall will thus persist, requiring continued reliance on imports from global producers.  For context, USGS reports that in 2022 China still produced ~24,000 t of arsenic (73% of world), Morocco ~6,900 t, and Russia ~1,000 t ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=175%E3%80%81%201%2C000%20Bolivia%20120%20140,from%20copper%2Cgold%2Cand%20lead%20smelter%20flue)) – dwarﬁng any allied output.  The critical minerals data confirm that even a tenfold scale-up of domestic recovery would leave us far short of demand ([www.sgpjbg.com](https://www.sgpjbg.com/bgdown/141218.html#:~:text=175%E3%80%81%201%2C000%20Bolivia%20120%20140,from%20copper%2Cgold%2Cand%20lead%20smelter%20flue)) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/mineral-demands-resilient-semiconductor-supply-chains#:~:text=outcry%20news,arsenic%20metal%20imports)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: XRF geochemical surveys; IP geophysics for sulfides; hyperspectral mineral mapping*  

• **Geochemical Surveys:** Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) analyzers enable rapid, field-based assays for arsenic.  Recent work shows pXRF can reliably measure As concentrations in rocks, soils and stream sediments (even at low ppm levels) when samples are properly prepared ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/2/166#:~:text=enough%20to%20exhibit%20the%20spatial,practical%20use%20in%20geochemical%20exploration)).  In mineral exploration, arsenic often occurs as an “indicator” or pathfinder for gold and base-metal deposits (especially epithermal, Carlin-type, and porphyry deposits).  Systematic soil and till sampling with pXRF can reveal arsenic anomalies that guide drill targeting.  

• **Geophysical Methods:** Arsenic-bearing sulfide minerals (e.g. arsenopyrite, enargite) usually have strong IP (induced polarization) and DC resistivity signatures due to their conductive/chargeable nature.  Chargeability surveys (IP) and resistivity imaging can help outline disseminated sulfide zones even under cover.  Combined geophysical modeling (IP + magnetics/EM) is commonly used to locate hidden arsenic-rich ore bodies in copper/gold districts.  (For example, arsenopyrite-rich zones often produce large positive IP anomalies in copper-gold porphyry systems.)  

• **Remote Sensing & Hyperspectral:** Airborne or UAV-mounted hyperspectral sensors can detect surface mineralogy.  Certain arsenic minerals (e.g. orpiment, realgar, scorodite) have characteristic spectral absorption features in the visible/shortwave-IR that can be identified with hyperspectral imaging.  Integration of spectral anomaly maps with GIS-based machine learning can highlight arsenic-bearing alteration zones.  In practice, hyperspectral data are often used to map alteration minerals (oric patterns) associated with arsenic deposition (e.g. oxidation zones in gold fields).  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Flotation concentration; roasting at 500–700°C; alkaline/acid leaching*  

• **Mining & Concentration:** Arsenic typically occurs in polymetallic sulfides (e.g. arsenopyrite FeAsS, enargite Cu₃AsS₄, tennantite, etc.).  Conventional sulfide ore processing uses froth flotation to concentrate valuable sulfides.  Specialized flotation circuits can be employed to produce a separate arsenic-rich concentrate.  For instance, bench-scale studies have floated enargite from chalcopyrite, yielding an arsenic concentrate containing ~15–20% As ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/970#:~:text=enargite%20sample%20were%2047.2,specimens%20had%20purities%20of%20%E2%89%A594)).  Selective collectors (xanthates, mercaptans) and depressants can optimize separation so that arsenic- bearing minerals report into a high-As concentrate stream.  Typical arsenic concentrates from such tests have on the order of 5–20 wt% As (depending on feed grade and reagent regime) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/970#:~:text=enargite%20sample%20were%2047.2,specimens%20had%20purities%20of%20%E2%89%A594)).  

• **Roasting & Volatilization:** An established method for arsenic recovery is oxidative roasting of sulfide concentrates.  Arsenopyrite (FeAsS) is oxidized at roughly 500–700°C to produce iron oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile arsenic trioxide vapor.  The simplified reaction is:  
> &nbsp;FeAsS + 2O₂ → FeO + As₂O₃(g) + SO₂.  
In real operations (e.g. fluidized-bed roasters), over 95% of the arsenic in a sulfide concentrate can be converted to As₂O₃ vapor ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/4/558?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=complex%20chemical%20reaction%20process,The%20main%20equilibrium%20reaction%20can)).  The As₂O₃ is then condensed and collected from the flue gases using baghouse or electrostatic filters.  Modern roasters are designed for high As capture efficiency, typically exceeding 99% of available As. Roasting thus concentrates arsenic into a manageable oxide stream while destroying much of the sulfur as SO₂.  

• **Hydrometallurgical Processing:** Arsenic can also be liberated by aqueous leaching.  Pressure oxidation (autoclaving) at 180–220°C is commonly used for refractory gold–arsenopyrite ores.  In POX, oxygen (or sometimes air + catalyst) oxidizes sulfides in slurry, producing ferrous/ferric sulfate and arsenic dissolved as arsenic acid or precipitated as ferric arsenate.  Studies show POX readily decomposes arsenopyrite, allowing arsenic to be stabilized as ferric arsenate in the slurry ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387990783_Recovery_of_gold_from_refractory_ore_employing_pressure_oxidation#:~:text=form%20of%20ferric%20arsenate%20,2021)).  The acid liquor can be purified and the resulting As-bearing residues (scorodite) filtered out.  Alternatively, biological oxidation (bio-oxidation) can be used: mesophilic iron/sulfur oxidizing bacteria (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans*, *A. ferriphilus*) can oxidize pyrite/arsenopyrite at 30–45°C. Such bioleaching processes have been demonstrated on gold-arsenopyrite concentrates; arsenic is released into solution (primarily as arsenite) which can then be precipitated ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387990783_Recovery_of_gold_from_refractory_ore_employing_pressure_oxidation#:~:text=form%20of%20ferric%20arsenate%20,2021)).  However, bacterial systems deal with lower concentrations and longer time-scales.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Baghouse/ESP collection; lime precipitation; iron co-precipitation*  

• **Gas‐Phase Collection:** After roasting, arsenic trioxide vapor must be captured from the off-gas.  Industrial plants use high-efficiency filters: baghouse cloth filters and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) can trap >99% of arsenic trioxide particles.  Any remaining As gases are typically quenched through wet scrubbers. The scrub solution is made strongly caustic (often with lime or sodium hydroxide) to convert As₂O₃ vapor into soluble arsenate/bisulfite, which is then removed as a slurry or precipitate.  The end result is that nearly all arsenic from roasting is captured either as solid As₂O₃ or as a high-pH arsenate sludge.  

• **Chemical Precipitation:** Dissolved arsenic (from leaching or scrubbing) is commonly precipitated out of solution.  A classic method is to adjust pH and add iron(III) or aluminum salts.  For example, adding FeCl₃ to an As‐laden solution causes formation of insoluble ferric arsenate or scorodite [FeAsO₄·2H₂O], which can be filtered off (this is the basis of stabilizing POX slurries).  Formally:  
> Fe³⁺ + AsO₄³⁻ → FeAsO₄·2H₂O (solid scordite)  
Similarly, treatment with lime (Ca(OH)₂) at high pH causes calcium arsenate precipitation.  These precipitates are relatively insoluble if properly crystallized and can encapsulate arsenic in waste forms.  Additives like gypsum or cement can further lock up the precipitate.  Scorodite in particular is known to be a very stable arsenic-bearing mineral for disposal ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387990783_Recovery_of_gold_from_refractory_ore_employing_pressure_oxidation#:~:text=form%20of%20ferric%20arsenate%20,2021)).  

• **Adsorption & Ion Exchange:** For low-concentration cleanup (e.g. contaminated water), adsorption media are used.  Common adsorbents include activated alumina, iron-oxide coated sands, granular ferric hydroxide, and synthetic ion-exchange resins.  These can reduce arsenic in effluent to below 10 ppb (0.01 mg/L).  The adsorbed arsenic is later back-flushed or co-precipitated for disposal.  In industrial settings, regeneration of adsorbent or continuous replacement are used to handle arsenic-bearing wastewater.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Sublimation at 613°C; carbon reduction; zone refining to 6N*  

• **Sublimation of As₂O₃:** Crude arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃) produced by roasting often contains impurities.  High-purity As₂O₃ can be obtained by sublimation.  As₂O₃ sublimes at 613 °C, leaving non-volatile residue.  By heating crude As₂O₃ in a controlled furnace and re-condensing the vapor, multiple sublimation cycles can produce >99.5% pure As₂O₃.  This is analogous to how pharmaceutical-grade or semiconductor-grade As₂O₃ is made; each pass removes particulate and metal impurities.  

• **Reduction to Metallic Arsenic:** To convert As₂O₃ to arsenic metal (for applications like GaAs doping), a carbon furnace reduction is used:  
>  As₂O₃ + 3C → 2As (metal) + 3CO↑.  
Typically this occurs around 700–800 °C in rotary or vacuum furnaces.  The arsenic metal condenses (it sublimes at ~613 °C as well) and is collected.  The crude metal contains metallic impurities (Cu, Pb, Sb, etc.) and must be further refined.  

• **Zone Refining:** To achieve electronic-grade (6N or higher) arsenic metal, zone refining (zone melting) is used.  In this process, a rod of impure arsenic is passed through a narrow molten zone repeatedly.  Impurities segregate and are carried to one end of the rod, progressively purifying the rest.  This can reduce impurity levels to parts-per-billion.  Similar to silicon or germanium zone-refining, multiple passes yield ultra-pure arsenic metal suitable for semiconductor doping.  

• **Chemical Vapor Purification:** In some cases, very high-purity arsine gas (AsH₃) is produced via chemical routes (e.g. reaction of Zn3As2 with H₂SO₄).  The crude AsH₃ is then distilled or decomposed to metallic arsenic.  Also, float-zone or distillation of arsine decomposition can yield “in-house” semiconductor-grade arsenic.  For GaAs substrate manufacture, reagent-grade AsH₃ and trimethyl gallium are often used, implying the arsenic came through such chemical purification steps.

• **Phytoremediation:** Certain plants hyperaccumulate arsenic, enabling it to be removed from contaminated soils.  The most studied is the Chinese brake fern (*Pteris vittata*), which can concentrate arsenic in its fronds up to around 1% of dry weight ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4585942/#:~:text=P,10)) (tolerating 10,000+ ppm in tissue).  Field trials show *P. vittata* can remove 50–90% of soil arsenic over several growth-and-harvest cycles.  Other metal-accumulating ferns (e.g. *Pteris cretica*) and crop plants adapted to arsenic (e.g. rice strains) are also used.  Harvested biomass must be disposed or treated (e.g. incineration or composting) to fix the arsenic.  

• **Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs):** For groundwater, a common approach is to install **zero-valent iron (ZVI)** or iron-oxide barriers in the flow path.  As contaminated groundwater passes through the barrier, arsenic is removed by reductive and adsorptive processes on the iron.  ZVI-PRBs have been shown to remove >95% of dissolved arsenic for many years in field trials.  Over 5–10 years of operation, arsenic accumulates on the iron matrix (often as iron-arsenate/oxyhydroxide) while clean water flows out.  PRBs require periodic replenishment of iron but offer a passive long-term treatment for plume control.  

• **Stabilization/Solidification:** Tailings and soils with immobilized arsenic can be treated with cementitious binders.  For instance, mixing contaminated soil with Portland cement (often with added lime or iron slag) chemically binds arsenic in the matrix, reducing leachability.  In extreme cases, viscous cohesion vitrification is used: contaminated material is melted (>1,200 °C) into a glass, trapping As in a silicate matrix for permanent disposal.  Both cement-solidification and vitrification produce a stable solid waste form that meets regulatory standards for arsenic containment.  

• **Constructed Wetlands & Bioreactors:** Engineered wetlands and sulfate-reducing bioreactors are used for low-level arsenic removal from water.  Wetlands combine plant uptake, microbial oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) and co-precipitation with arsenic; they can achieve effluent arsenic <50 ppb passively.  Sulfate-reducing bioreactors (using organic substrates and *Desulfovibrio*/other bacteria) precipitate arsenic as sulfide (e.g. orpiment realgar) under anaerobic conditions.  These biological systems are slower but treat dissolved arsenic in wastewater or mining drainage effectively.
