## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production

*Summary: Multi-stage solvent extraction for heavy REE separation; hydrometallurgical processing infrastructure*

The **primary bottleneck** is *separation and purification of thulium from other heavy rare earth elements*. Thulium's chemistry is nearly identical to neighboring lanthanides (holmium, erbium, ytterbium, lutetium), requiring dozens of specialized solvent extraction stages to achieve separation. Currently, only China operates commercial-scale heavy REE separation facilities capable of producing pure thulium compounds. 

Allied efforts are emerging but limited. Energy Fuels' White Mesa Mill in Utah has demonstrated neodymium-praseodymium separation and plans to expand to heavy REE processing, but commercial heavy REE separation remains unproven outside China. The separation requires either:
- Multi-stage (30-50+ stages) solvent extraction using organophosphorus extractants
- Novel separation methods (e.g., supported liquid membranes, redox-based magnetic separation)
- Ion exchange chromatography (laboratory-scale only)

Without establishing domestic heavy REE separation capacity, allied nations cannot produce thulium regardless of mining output. The technology exists but requires significant capital investment ($100M+ per facility) and operational expertise currently concentrated in China. This hydrometallurgical processing gap represents the critical constraint on allied thulium production through 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)

*Summary: <5 tons/year thulium oxide equivalent across all allied nations*

• **United States:** The U.S. operates one active REE mine at Mountain Pass, California, which produced approximately 43,000 metric tons of rare earth concentrate (equivalent to ~15,000 tonnes REO) in 2022. Thulium comprises only 0.01-0.05% of typical bastnäsite ore REE content, suggesting actual thulium oxide production of <1 tonne annually. Mountain Pass concentrate is primarily light REE-focused (cerium, lanthanum, neodymium). Energy Fuels processes imported monazite concentrates at White Mesa, Utah, but currently produces only neodymium-praseodymium products, not separated thulium.

• **Australia:** Lynas Corporation's Mt. Weld mine produced approximately 23,000 tonnes of REO in FY2023, making it the largest REE producer outside China. However, Mt. Weld ore contains primarily light REEs with minimal heavy REE content (<2% of total REE). Thulium represents <0.1% of the ore's REE content, yielding at most 1-2 tonnes of thulium oxide annually within mixed concentrates. Lynas does not currently separate individual heavy REEs.

• **Canada:** Canada has no commercial REE production. Several projects are in development (Vital Metals' Nechalacho began small-scale production in 2021 but suspended operations in 2024; other projects remain in exploration). **Current Canadian thulium output is zero**.

• **Europe (EU/Norway/Iceland):** No active REE mines operate in Europe. The Norra Kärr deposit in Sweden and projects in Greenland remain undeveloped. LKAB in Sweden announced significant REE resources in iron ore deposits (2023) but production is not expected before 2030. **Current European thulium production is zero**.

• **Japan:** Japan has no domestic REE mining. All thulium is imported as compounds or within manufactured products, primarily from China. Recycling efforts focus on neodymium and dysprosium from magnets, not thulium.

• **Summary:** Combined U.S. and allied thulium oxide production is effectively <5 tonnes annually, entirely as unseparated trace components within REE concentrates. No allied nation currently produces separated thulium compounds at commercial scale.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)

*Summary: 150-200 tons/year thulium oxide*

• **Projected U.S. Demand:** Thulium applications include:
- Medical lasers (Tm:YAG for surgery, lithotripsy): ~20-30 tonnes oxide/year
- Portable X-ray devices: ~10-15 tonnes oxide/year  
- High-temperature superconductors: ~5-10 tonnes oxide/year
- Defense applications (radiation detectors): ~5-10 tonnes oxide/year

Current U.S. consumption is estimated at 30-50 tonnes thulium oxide annually based on import data. With 5-7% annual growth in medical laser markets and emerging applications in fiber lasers for manufacturing, U.S. demand could reach 60-80 tonnes by 2030.

• **Allied (Ex-U.S.) Demand:** 
- EU: 40-50 tonnes/year by 2030 (medical devices, industrial lasers)
- Japan: 30-40 tonnes/year by 2030 (electronics, medical equipment)
- Other allies: 20-30 tonnes/year by 2030

Global thulium oxide demand outside China was approximately 120 tonnes in 2020. With projected 5-8% annual growth driven by medical laser adoption and industrial applications, total allied demand could reach 150-200 tonnes by 2030.

• **Critical Applications:** Unlike other REEs used in volume applications (magnets, catalysts), thulium serves specialized high-value markets where substitution is difficult. Medical Tm:YAG lasers offer unique tissue interaction properties, and thulium-doped fiber amplifiers enable specific wavelengths for telecommunications.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)

*Summary: 20-40 tons/year thulium oxide potential*

• **Existing Mines & Expansion:** 
- Mountain Pass could increase production to 50,000+ tonnes REE concentrate by 2030, potentially yielding 2-5 tonnes thulium oxide if heavy REE processing is established
- Lynas plans Malaysian heavy REE separation by 2025, potentially producing 5-10 tonnes separated thulium oxide annually
- Energy Fuels targets heavy REE separation capability by 2027, processing both domestic and imported feedstock

• **New Projects:**
- Round Top (Texas): Contains elevated heavy REE including thulium; pilot plant planned for 2026
- Bokan Mountain (Alaska): Heavy REE-enriched deposit; feasibility studies ongoing
- Australian projects (Browns Range, Dubbo): Could add 5-10 tonnes combined if developed

• **Recycling & Secondary Sources:** 
- Phosphate byproducts: Florida phosphate operations generate REE-bearing waste. Pilot projects demonstrate 70-90% REE recovery from phosphogypsum. Potential for 5-10 tonnes thulium oxide annually by 2030 if commercialized
- Coal ash: Contains trace REEs including thulium; several pilot projects underway but commercial viability uncertain
- End-of-life recycling: Limited thulium recycling potential due to small volumes and dispersed uses

• **Combined Outlook:** Under optimistic scenarios with multiple projects advancing and heavy REE separation capacity established, allied domestic supply could reach 20-40 tonnes thulium oxide by 2030. This assumes:
- At least one heavy REE separation facility operational in U.S.
- Lynas successfully implements heavy REE separation
- One or two new heavy REE projects reach production
- Secondary recovery from phosphates begins commercial operation

Realistically, allied thulium supply will likely remain at 10-20 tonnes annually by 2030, maintaining >80% import dependence.

*Summary: Airborne radiometrics; XRF geochemistry; carbonatite mapping; ion-adsorption clay detection*

• **Airborne Radiometric Surveys:** Heavy REE minerals (monazite, xenotime) contain 5-15% thorium plus uranium, creating distinctive gamma-ray signatures. Modern airborne surveys detect thorium anomalies at 50-100m resolution. USGS surveys identified heavy mineral deposits along Atlantic coastal plains containing 0.5-2% monazite with elevated thulium.

• **Geological Mapping:** Thulium concentrates in:

## Key Bottleneck Summary

The critical constraint on allied thulium production is **heavy REE separation infrastructure**. While mining and initial extraction are straightforward, separating thulium from other heavy REEs requires sophisticated hydrometallurgical facilities that don't exist outside China at commercial scale. Establishing this capacity requires:

1. **Technical expertise:** Few engineers outside China have operated heavy REE separation circuits
2. **Capital investment:** $100-200M per facility for commercial-scale operation
3. **Time:** 3-5 years from planning to commissioning
4. **Feedstock security:** Consistent heavy REE concentrate supply to justify investment

Without addressing this separation bottleneck, allied nations will remain dependent on Chinese processing regardless of mining developments. The technology is proven but requires immediate investment and development to achieve any meaningful domestic thulium production by 2030.
