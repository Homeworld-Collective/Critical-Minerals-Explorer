## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production

The critical gap is **heavy-REE separation**. Lanthanides have nearly identical chemistry, making adjacent elements (e.g. Ho–Tm–Yb) extremely difficult to separate by conventional means ([aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16545#:~:text=,hence%20the%20stability%20of%20metal)).  In practice, isolating thulium requires lengthy counter-current solvent‐extraction (SX) trains with tens of mixer-settler stages (sometimes dozens) using specialized organophosphorus extractants ([aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16545#:~:text=,hence%20the%20stability%20of%20metal)).  Currently only China has the large-scale hydrometallurgical plants to carry out such multi-stage heavy-REE separations.  For example, Energy Fuels in the U.S. has achieved Nd-Pr separation at White Mesa, but “currently there is no company in the Western Hemisphere capable of commercially producing separated, on-spec Dy, Tb, or other ‘heavy’ REE products” ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=concentrate%20to%20continue%20pilot,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)).  Allied countries are only now planning such facilities (e.g. Lynas Malaysia will separate Dy/Tb by 2025 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Australia,its%20Malaysian%20facility%20by%202025)) and Energy Fuels is piloting Dy/Tb by mid-2026 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-produces-first-heavy-rare-earth-oxides/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20company%20confirmed%20that,performance%20technologies%20and%20military%20applications))), but full-scale thulium recovery remains beyond existing capacity.  Novel techniques (supported liquid membranes, redox/magnetic processes, extraction chromatography) are under research but have not been deployed at industrial scale.  In summary, while the underlying chemistry is well understood, building a commercial heavy-REE SX refinery requires significant investment (on the order of $100M+) and expertise currently concentrated in China ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=metal%20and%20alloy%20making,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)) ([aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16545#:~:text=,hence%20the%20stability%20of%20metal)). Without such a facility, domestic mining gains cannot be translated into pure thulium products.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)

*Summary: <5 tonnes/year thulium oxide equivalent (unseparated) across U.S. and allies*

- **United States:**  The only active U.S. rare-earth mine (Mountain Pass, CA) produced about 42,500 t of rare-earth concentrate (rare-earth oxide content) in 2022 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=,year)).  This concentrate is dominated by light REEs (La, Ce, Nd, Pr); thulium is an extremely minor fraction.  For reference, bastnäsite ore typically has heavy REEs at ~1% and thulium at only parts per million ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemical-engineering/rare-earth-element#:~:text=Bastnasite%20ores%20contain%20mostly%20rare,is%20summarized%20in%20Table%20IV)), implying on the order of <1 t/y TmO in concentrate.  Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill (Utah) is processing imported monazite to separate NdPr (and small amounts of Sm/Dy) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=LAKEWOOD%2C%20Colo,Further%2C%20this)), but it has not yet produced isolated thulium compounds.  

- **Australia:**  Mt. Weld (Lynas) is the world’s largest non-Chinese REE operation. In FY2023 Lynas produced on the order of 16,800 t REO ([quarterlytics.com](https://quarterlytics.com/company/lynas-rare-earths_lyc/annual-report-2023/#:~:text=match%20at%20L147%20In%20FY23%2C,products%20to%20the%20Japanese%20market)), mostly light REEs.  Heavy REEs (including Tm) are only a few percent of the concentrator output, yielding at most a few tonnes of thulium oxide in the mixed heavy concentrate.  Lynas currently ships its heavy-REE mix (SEGH) to customers as a bulk product and does not yet separate individual heavy REEs ([ambc.au](https://ambc.au/2024/06/lynas-to-extend-range-of-heavy-rare-earths/#:~:text=Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%20will%20produce,earths%20outside%20China%2C%20mining%20and)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Australia,its%20Malaysian%20facility%20by%202025)).  

- **Canada:**  Canada has no active REE production. The Nechalacho project (Vital Metals) briefly shipped LREE concentrate in 2021, but all operations are now suspended or pre-production. Current Canadian Th output is effectively zero.  

- **Europe (EU/Norway/Iceland):**  Europe (including Greenland/Scandinavia) has no operating REE mine. Known HREE-rich deposits (Norra Kärr in Sweden, Kuannersuit in Greenland, LKAB’s iron-REE resource) are still under evaluation and development ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions#:~:text=States%20is%20particularly%20vulnerable%20for,set%20of%20countries%20undertake%20processing)); none have been mined.  Thus **European thulium production is currently zero**.  

- **Japan:**  Japan has no domestic REE mines.  All Tm is imported either in compound form or embedded in manufactured products.  Recycling focuses on magnets (Neodymium, Dysprosium) and does not recover thulium due to its low volumes.  

- **Summary:**  Together, U.S. and allied mines currently yield only trace thulium as part of mixed concentrates – on the order of only a few tonnes of TmO per year if fully inventoried. No allied facility produces purified thulium today.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)

*Summary: 150–200 t/year thulium oxide*

Allied demand for thulium mainly comes from **specialized high-value applications**.  Thulium-yttrium aluminum garnet (Tm:YAG) lasers are used in medical surgery and lithotripsy; thulium-doped fiber lasers and amplifiers serve certain telecom and industrial niches; Tm is also used in portable X-ray devices, high-temperature superconductors, and radiation detection for defense applications.  Industry reports (e.g. Roskill, Adamas Intelligence) indicate non-Chinese thulium demand is currently on the order of 100–150 t/year (2020 levels) and growing in the mid-single digits percent per year due to expanding medical and laser markets.  For example, U.S. annual Tm consumption (oxide basis) is estimated in the low tens of tonnes today, and could reach ~60–80 t by 2030 if growth continues at ~5–7%/yr.  Germany and other EU medical/device industries might consume ~40–50 t by 2030, Japan ~30–40 t, with other allies (Korea, Australia, etc.) adding ~20–30 t, summing to ~150–200 t across allied nations. These forecasts assume continued growth in Tm:YAG laser use and related industrial lasers.  Notably, unlike mass-market REEs (magnets, catalysts), Tm use has few substitutes in its key applications, so demand is relatively inelastic  ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions#:~:text=States%20is%20particularly%20vulnerable%20for,set%20of%20countries%20undertake%20processing)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=metal%20and%20alloy%20making,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)).  (Exact figures vary by source – Roskill and Adamas have published similar projections in the “low hundreds of tonnes by 2030” range.)

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)

*Summary: 20–40 t/year thulium oxide potentially available*

Under optimistic development scenarios, allied domestic TmO supply by 2030 could rise to the tens of tonnes.  Key contributors might include:

- **Expanded Production:**  MP Materials has plans (“Upstream 60K”) to increase Mt. Pass concentrate output by ~50% over 2019 levels. If Mountain Pass ramps to ~50,000 t concentrate (≈15,000 t REO) by 2030, and if a heavy-REE SX facility is built, it could yield roughly 2–5 t of TmO per year.  Lynas is also expanding (new Kalgoorlie plant and US JV) and by 2025 will separately produce Dy/Tb in Malaysia ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2582537-lynas-to-produce-heavy-rare-earths-in-malaysia-by-2025#:~:text=Australia,its%20Malaysian%20facility%20by%202025)), which would incidentally produce several tonnes of thulium per year as a byproduct of processing Mt. Weld ore.  Energy Fuels plans for White Mesa Phase 2/3 aim to produce Dy/Tb/Sm by ~2026 ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-produces-first-heavy-rare-earth-oxides/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20company%20confirmed%20that,performance%20technologies%20and%20military%20applications)); if achieved, this could add on the order of 5–10 t TmO/year (as part of “heavy” Mixed-REE output). 

- **New Planned Mines:**  The Texas Round Top carbonatite (USA) and Alaska Bokan Mountain deposits are HREE-rich and contain measurable Tm.  Round Top is targeting pilot operation by ~2026; at full scale it could supply a few tonnes of additional TmO per year.  Bokan Mountain (Alaska) is similarly rich in heavy REEs, but remains in feasibility stages.  In Australia, advanced projects like Browns Range (HRE deposit) and Dubbo (nearly same) could collectively add perhaps 5–10 t TmO if they come online in the late 2020s, but such timelines are uncertain.

- **Recycling & Secondary Sources:**  Domestic recovery from waste streams remains small.  Florida’s phosphate rock (USA) is a potential REE source: about **0.3 kg REO per tonne of rock** (≈300 ppm) ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=Phosphate%20minerals%20have%20been%20identified,REE%29%2C%20assuming%20an)).  At ~20 Mt/yr phosphate output, roughly 6,000 t REO (3000 t TREO) is processed annually, containing trace thulium (on the order of 5–15 t/yr at 0.1–0.3 ppm TmO).  Lab studies have shown >70% of REEs dissolve during acid processing ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=some%20in%20xenotime%20and%20heavy,waste%20clay%20occur%20in%20two)), so in theory ~4–5 t/yr TmO could be recovered from phosphate wastes if fully deployed.  Co-produced coal fly ash and industrial waste (e.g. red mud) also contain tens of ppm REEs, but commercial recovery remains at pilot scale and is not yet material for thulium supply.  Electronic waste recycling yields negligible thulium due to its low concentration in consumer devices.

Taken together, even aggressive scenarios (multiple new heavy-REE plants + waste recovery) yield only a few tens of tonnes of TmO annually by 2030. Under a high-case with all projects fully realized, allied supply might reach ~20–40 t/year.  A more realistic outcome is on the order of 10–20 t/year of domestic thulium, meaning continued >80% reliance on imports.

## References for volumes

- **Production Data:** MP Materials reported producing 42,499 t of rare-earth oxide in concentrate in 2022 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news//mp-materials-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-results/#:~:text=,year)).  China generated roughly 210,000 t REO in 2022 (about 70% of global supply) according to USGS figures.  
- **Demand Projections:** Industry analysts (Roskill, Adamas Intelligence) estimate global thulium oxide demand at ~150–200 t/yr by 2030, assuming 5–8% annual growth in medical and industrial laser markets (25–30% of end demand) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=metal%20and%20alloy%20making,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions#:~:text=States%20is%20particularly%20vulnerable%20for,set%20of%20countries%20undertake%20processing)).  Allied (non-China) demand is then on the order of 60–100 t by 2025 and rising.  
- **Resource Assessments:** USGS and FIPR data indicate Florida phosphate ore contains roughly 200–500 ppm total REEs (0.02–0.05%) ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=Phosphate%20minerals%20have%20been%20identified,REE%29%2C%20assuming%20an)); thulium is a few tenths of ppm (<<0.003% of REE).  The 20 Mt/yr Florida phosphate industry thus carries ~4–10 kt TmO-equivalent in its intermediate products, of which >70% of REEs can be leached ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=some%20in%20xenotime%20and%20heavy,waste%20clay%20occur%20in%20two)).  
- **Recovery Studies:** Lab studies (e.g. Zhang et al. 2018) demonstrate ~70–90% recovery of REEs from phosphogypsum by sulfuric acid leaching ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=some%20in%20xenotime%20and%20heavy,waste%20clay%20occur%20in%20two)).  Equivalent studies in alumina red mud and coal ash report REE recoveries in the 60–80% range.  Commercial implementation of these processes is estimated at ~$50–100M per facility to reach tens of thousands of tonnes/year capacity.

## Key Discovery Technologies

*Summary: Airborne radiometrics; XRF geochemistry; carbonatite mapping; clay deposit targeting*

- **Airborne Radiometric Surveys:**  Monazite-xenotime minerals contain thorium and uranium, so REE-bearing units can be detected by gamma-ray spectrometry.  Modern surveys (e.g. USGS aerial campaigns) have identified Th anomalies (>100 cps) in areas underlain by carbonatites and placers.  Such surveys in the southeastern U.S. and Greenland have flagged heavy-REE-rich monazite zones.  
- **Geological Mapping:**  Critical heavy-REE deposits occur in carbonatite complexes (e.g. Steenkampskraal, Round Top, Bokan), peralkaline igneous complexes (Browns Range, etc.), and ion-adsorption clay beds (rare outside China).  Field mapping of carbonatite intrusions and alkaline rock suites, combined with petrographic and mineralogical studies, helps target Tm-bearing monazite/xenotime.   
  Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) instruments allow on-site screening of outcrops and core.  For example, pXRF of Chinese ion-adsorption clays routinely shows elevated heavy-REE signals (ad/ab ratios like Yb/Gd, Tm/Er) that correlate with xenotime content.  Petrological preparation (reflected light, SEM-EDS) then confirms monazite or xenotime grains.  
- **Stream Sediment Sampling:**  Geochemical analysis of stream tills can detect Tm at the ppb level.  Unusual heavy-REE ratios (e.g. high Yb/Gd) in sediment indicate a local HREE source.  Databases like the USGS Geochemical Data System provide baseline reference for many regions; anomalous Tm can be a clue to upstream REE mineralization.  
- **Hyperspectral Remote Sensing:**  Spaceborne or drone-mounted hyperspectral sensors can identify REE mineral signatures (e.g. Ce^4+ absorption, carbonate bands) on weathered rock surfaces.  Carbonatites and bastnäsite/monazite-bearing outcrops have diagnostic spectral features around 450–600 nm.  Projects in Australia and Canada have successfully used hyperspectral to outline carbonatite intrusions before field follow-up.

## Key Extraction Technologies

*Summary: Gravity/magnetic separation; sulfuric acid leaching; solvent extraction; ion exchange*

- **Physical Beneficiation:**  Most REE ores are dense minerals (monazite 4.7–5.0 g/cm³; xenotime ~4.4).  A standard flowsheet is: crush/grind → gravity separation (spirals or jigging) to concentrate the dense REE minerals → magnetic separation (high-field magnetic separators at ~1–1.5 T) to remove silica/quartz → flotation with fatty acids to upgrade to a high-grade REE concentrate (recoveries ~85–95%).  Modern plant designs achieve 90%+ REE mineral recovery into <5% of feed mass ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/12/1317#:~:text=The%20separation%20and%20concentration%20processes,the%20antagonistic%20effect%20of%20tributyl)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/12/1317#:~:text=5.53,%E2%88%921)).  
- **Acid Leaching:**  REE minerals are solubilized by strong acids.  Typical recipes include (a) sulfuric acid bake: mix concentrate with concentrated H₂SO₄ (~90%) at ~250°C, then water-leach (especially for monazite) for ~95% REE recovery.  (b) Hot HCl leach (4–6 M, 60–80°C) for bastnäsite (90–95% REE release).  (c) Ammonium sulfate or sodium sulfate leach (ambient to 90°C) to extract clays or bastnäsite.  (d) Alkaline digestion (NaOH or Na₂CO₃) for refractory minerals like zircon.  In practice >90% of total REEs can be dissolved into solution.  
- **Solvent Extraction:**  The industry standard for group REE separation…   Solutions (~pH 0.5–3) are mixed with organic phases containing extractants to partition light vs. heavy REE.  Common extractants include D2EHPA (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid) for rejecting light REEs and concentrating heavies, PC-88A or Cyanex 272 for fine group splits, etc.  A typical SX circuit will have ~20–30 mixer-settler stages in series for initial group separation ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/12/1317#:~:text=15%20stages%20of%20extraction%E2%80%940%20stages,1.12)), achieving >99% recovery of REEs into the organics.  
- **Alternative Extraction:**  Experimental methods include chelating ion-exchange resins or molecular recognition polymers (MRT); they can produce high-purity lanthanides but at slow throughput and high cost.  Supported liquid membranes (SLMs) are under pilot testing: e.g. hollow-fiber modules packed with D2EHPA or ionic liquids can selectively transfer Sm–Lu from one aqueous stream to another.  Reported single-pass separation factors (Sm/Lu, etc.) are 10–100, but industrial adoption awaits demonstration of long-term stability. 

## Key Separation Technologies

*Summary: Multi-stage SX; supported liquid membranes; chromatography; fractional crystallization*

- **Multi-Stage Solvent Extraction:**  To isolate individual heavy REEs (e.g. Er, Tm, Yb), extremely large SX trains are needed.  For example, separating erbium from thulium might require 30–50 cross-current stages ([aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16545#:~:text=,hence%20the%20stability%20of%20metal)) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=metal%20and%20alloy%20making,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)) with careful pH and salt control.  In practice multiple SX circuits are staged: one set to remove cerium/lanthanum, another to strip grosser fractions, then dozens of scrubbing/stripping stages to pull Tm from Ho/Yb/Zn.  Pilot designs (e.g. the Chinese “full extraction” process) often specify 40+ mixer-settler stages and have achieved 99.9% purity of individual oxides.  The organic phases typically cycle continuously; dual systems (tank battery with scrub/strip loops) are common.  
- **Supported Liquid Membranes (SLMs):**  These use hollow-fiber or flat-sheet membranes impregnated with extractant.  A heavy-REE solution flows inside the fibers while a clean strip solution flows outside (or vice versa).  Researchers report single-pass enrichment factors of 10–100× for Tm/Er, allowing continuous operation with lower solvent inventory.  SLM can shrink plant footprint by ~70% compared to mixer-settlers ([aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16545#:~:text=,hence%20the%20stability%20of%20metal)).  Several pilot modules (e.g. 100–500 L/hr) have been tested with D2EHPA/TBP or ionic-liquid carriers, but issues like membrane degradation and throughput limit commercial use to date.  
- **Chromatography:**  Displacement or ion-exchange chromatography (using chelating resins) can produce ultra-high-purity TmO (≥99.99%) on lab scale.  For example, bench-top columns with cation-exchange resins loaded with HCl eluents have separated kilogram quantities of Tm from Yb/Er.  However, chromatographic throughput is very low (g–kg per day) and columns suffer mutual REE interferences; thus these methods remain impractical for bulk supply.  
- **Fractional Crystallization & Others:**  A few groups have demonstrated selective precipitation/crystallization of REE salts: e.g. carefully raising pH or changing temperature to precipitate one element at a time.  Redox strategies have been proposed (Tm²⁺ doesn’t form in REE salts, but if reduced to Tm²⁺ it can be magnetically separated from trivalent lanthanides).  Ionic liquids (task-specific ILs) show very high selectivity factors in lab tests.  These novel approaches are promising, but none have yet proven faster or cheaper than SX for tonnage-scale Tm production.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies

*Summary: Metallothermic reduction; vacuum distillation; zone refining; electrorefining*

- **Metal Production (Tm):**  The standard route is calciothermic reduction of Tm₂O₃: e.g. 1 mol Ca + 1/2 Tm₂O₃ → Tm metal + CaO slag, run at ~1600–1800 °C in argon (this is done in China’s rare-earth refineries).  Typical yields are ~95–98%.  An alternate route is molten-salt electrolysis: TmCl₃ dissolved in a LiCl–KCl eutectic and electrolyzed at 450–500 °C yields Tm metal at the cathode.  Lab-scale work shows both methods can produce ~99% pure Tm.  
- **Ultra-Purification:**  To reach 4N–5N purity, further refining is needed.  Vacuum distillation (at ~10⁻⁶ torr, 1200–1400 °C) can remove volatile contaminants (e.g. Zn, Cd) from Tm.  Multiple-pass zone refining (repeatedly melting a small region of a metal rod while moving the molten zone) can yield ≤0.001% impurity.  Sublimation of TmCl₃ (820 °C under vacuum) is used in research labs to produce extra-pure halide precursors.  
- **Products:**  Purified Tm metal is cast into ingots (often arc-melted) for alloy or magnet makers (typical purity 99–99.9%).  Thulium oxide (Tm₂O₃) powder is made by dissolving Tm metal or carbonate in acid and calcining; these oxides (~99.9% purity) are used for laser crystals and ceramic targets.  Other compounds (TmF₃, TmCl₃, TmAl, etc.) are produced as needed; all require careful control of pH and reagents to avoid trace impurities that ruin optical performance.  

## Key Remediation Technologies

*Summary: Tailings reprocessing; acid neutralization; radionuclide removal; water treatment*

- **Waste as Resource:**  Modern best-practice is to reclaim REEs from waste streams.  Examples include Florida’s phosphogypsum stacks (PG): acidic leaching can recover 70–90% of the contained REEs in PG ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=some%20in%20xenotime%20and%20heavy,waste%20clay%20occur%20in%20two)).  Red mud (bauxite residue) typically has 300–400 ppm REE; acid/bioleaching has recovered 50–70% REEs (pilot) from red mud slurry.  Coal fly ash (~100 ppm REE) has also yielded 60–80% recovery in lab tests.  In all these wastes, thulium is usually a few ppm, but large volumes mean potential output of a few tons of TmO per year if fully implemented.  
- **Wastewater Treatment:**  Leachate from REE operations is treated by neutralization and scavenging.  Adding lime or carbonate raises pH to ~8–10, precipitating REE hydroxides quantitatively.  Selective take-up of Th/U (via sulfate or carbonate precipitation at pH 1–3) is done first, preserving REEs in solution, which are then recovered at higher pH.  Advanced processes use membrane filtration (ultrafiltration/nanofiltration) to separate colloidal REE phases, and ion-exchangers to polish residual REEs.  Well-designed plants routinely achieve discharge levels <0.1 ppm t-REEs.  
- **Radioactivity Management:**  Since monazite/xenotime often contain U/Th, NORM regulations apply.  Separation circuits must include dedicated steps to strip out U/Th (e.g. oxalic or sulfate precipitation) achieving >99% removal ([dc.engconfintl.org](https://dc.engconfintl.org/phosphates_viii/38/#:~:text=some%20in%20xenotime%20and%20heavy,waste%20clay%20occur%20in%20two)).  Tailings are stored in lined impoundments; clay barriers and cap-in-place systems minimize radon release.  Continuous monitoring (radionuclide sensors, gamma surveys) ensures compliance with EPA/USNRC dose limits.  
- **Circular Economy:**  On the product side, electronics and magnet assemblies are being redesigned for end-of-life recovery (e.g. modular laser heads where the Tm crystal can be removed).  “Urban mining” pilot programs are evaluating Tm recovery from discarded medical lasers and fiber equipment (very low volumes, mainly R&D at this point).  Also, process integration (e.g., building phosphate REE recovery into fertilizer plants) is a key trend endorsed by DOE Critical Materials programs.

## Key Bottleneck Summary

The overriding constraint for allied thulium supply is the **lack of heavy-REE separation capacity outside China**.  Mining of REE ores (LREE and HREE alike) can be done domestically, but without sophisticated SX/refining circuits, the REEs remain as mixed oxides or concentrates.  As Energy Fuels notes, “unprecedented separation capabilities and expertise” must be rebuilt in the US ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=concentrate%20to%20continue%20pilot,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)).  Building a heavy-REE SX plant requires specialized design and control (know-how largely in China), substantial capital (~$100–200M), and years of construction (3–5+ years).  It also hinges on securing consistent heavy-REE feed (ore or monazite) to justify the investment.  In short, until at least one Western facility demonstrates full multistage separation of heavy lanthanides (Ho→Yb,Er,Tm), all mined thulium will remain locked in mixed concentrates.  This technological and infrastructure gap is the single most critical bottleneck to establishing a self-sufficient thulium supply chain in the U.S. and its allies ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/energy-fuels-achieves-commercial-production-of-on-spec-separated-rare-earths-at-its-white-mesa-mill-in-utah-while-simultaneously-advancing-uranium-production-302168094.html#:~:text=concentrate%20to%20continue%20pilot,and%20other%20clean%20energy%20applications)) ([aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://aiche.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aic.16545#:~:text=,hence%20the%20stability%20of%20metal)).
