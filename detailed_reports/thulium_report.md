## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)

• **United States:**  The U.S. has only one active REE mine (Mountain Pass, CA), which in total produced ~43,000 t of rare‐earth oxides in 2022 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,100)).  Thulium is only a trace component (<0.1%) of this mix, implying actual Tm output is on the order of only a few tonnes per year.  (The question context’s figure of 3,425 t/yr implies a thulium-enriched concentrate, but no public data confirms this.)  Critically, U.S. firms (e.g. Energy Fuels at White Mesa, UT) currently import nearly 100% of their thulium ([ptoe.com](https://ptoe.com/thulium-the-hidden-heavyweight-of-rare-earths/#:~:text=Import%20Dependence)).  

• **Australia:**  Lynas Corporation’s Mt. Weld mine (WA) is Australia’s sole commercial REE producer, shipping ~18,000 t of REO in 2022 ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,100)).  The heavy-REE fraction (including yttrium and thulium) is only a small percentage of this total (possibly a few hundred tonnes of “heavies” overall).  Thus Mt. Weld may yield on the order of tens of tonnes of thulium annually.  No other Australian mine currently produces thulium, as most deposits (e.g. Mount Weld) focus on light REEs (Nd, Pr, Ce).  

• **Canada:**  Canada has no operating REE mine.  Several projects (e.g., Eldor/Ashram in Québec, Nechalacho in NWT) are in exploration or development, but none are producing thulium yet.  Therefore, **current Canadian Thulium output is effectively zero**.  The Natural Resources Canada fact sheet notes Canada “is host to several advanced exploration projects” but is “not a current commercial producer” ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=Although%20not%20a%20current%20commercial,tonnes%20of%20rare%20earth%20oxide)).  

• **Europe (EU/Norway/Iceland):**  There are no active REE mines in the EU or Norway/Iceland that produce thulium.  One potential heavy-REE deposit (Norra Kärr, Sweden) remains undeveloped.  Europe relies entirely on imports for heavy REEs.  The DERA (German Mineral Resources Agency) report confirms global thulium production is “correspondingly low” and not yet supply-critical ([rareearths.com](https://rareearths.com/thulium/#:~:text=As%20the%20areas%20of%20application,chains%20are%20susceptible%20to%20interruptions)).  

• **Japan:**  Japan has no domestic REE mining; all thulium requirements are imported, primarily from China ([ptoe.com](https://ptoe.com/thulium-the-hidden-heavyweight-of-rare-earths/#:~:text=Import%20Dependence)).  In practice, Japan (like the U.S.) ships in processed heavy-REE oxides or materials containing thulium.

• **Summary:**  Overall, U.S. and allied nations currently produce negligible thulium.  As USGS notes, the U.S. total REE output is in the tens of thousands of tonnes, but *heavy* REEs (Tm, Yb, etc.) are only a tiny fraction ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,100)).  One report explicitly states that global thulium production is still extremely small ([rareearths.com](https://rareearths.com/thulium/#:~:text=As%20the%20areas%20of%20application,chains%20are%20susceptible%20to%20interruptions)).  In short, domestic (US/allied) thulium supply today is virtually zero aside from trace byproducts of the few existing REE operations.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)

• **Projected U.S. Demand:**  Thulium is used in niche high-tech applications (e.g. Tm:YAG medical lasers, portable X-ray sources, defense detectors ([ptoe.com](https://ptoe.com/thulium-the-hidden-heavyweight-of-rare-earths/#:~:text=%2A%20Medical%20Advancements%3A%20Thulium,devices%2C%20enhancing%20data%20storage%20efficiency))).  Current U.S. consumption is very small (on the order of 10s of t/yr).  By 2030, demand may grow with new technologies, but remains a tiny component of critical-mineral use.  For reference, U.S. phosphate researchers note “enough rare earths in U.S. phosphate waste to meet U.S. demand” ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=not%20in%20the%20ground%2C%20but,phosphate%20industry%20byproducts%20like%20phosphogypsum)) – implying current U.S. Tm demand is only on the order of 10^1–10^2 tonnes per year.  

• **Allied (Ex-U.S.) Demand:**  Allied nations (EU, Australia, Japan, Canada) also have minimal thulium needs.  Japan’s advanced electronics and medical sectors use some Tm (e.g. for lasers, sensors), and Europe’s defense and energy industries use small amounts.  It is estimated that global thulium oxide demand (excluding China) was ~119 t in 2017 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/450129/global-reo-thulium-oxide-demand-outside-of-china-forecast/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20displays%20the%20total,119%20metric%20tons%20in%202017)); if that market grows by ~5–10% per year, ex-China demand by 2030 might reach a few hundred tonnes annually.  Another analyst notes that because thulium is scarce and specialized, "demand for medical and defense technologies ensures continued interest in securing a stable supply" ([ptoe.com](https://ptoe.com/thulium-the-hidden-heavyweight-of-rare-earths/#:~:text=Due%20to%20its%20rarity%20and,in%20securing%20a%20stable%20supply)) – but total usage will still be modest.  In sum, combined U.S. and allied thulium demand by 2030 is likely on the order of 10^2 t/yr (primarily oxide form), driven by lasers and niche devices, with most of it currently filled by imports.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)

• **Existing Mines & Processing:**  Assuming current projects advance, U.S. production could rise somewhat by 2030.  For example, Energy Fuels (White Mesa Mill, UT) has commissioned Nd-Pr oxide processing (~1,000 t/yr capacity) and plans heavy-REE outputs ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Since%202020%2C%20Energy%20Fuels%20has,term%20on%20these%20critical%20elements)).  If fully realized, U.S. domestic REE mining/refining might supply several thousand tonnes per year of mixed REE compounds by 2030, but only a tiny fraction of that is thulium.  Australia’s Lynas is expected to maintain its 18,000 t/yr REO output ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,100)) (light REE-focused), which supplies some allied needs – though heavy REE content (hence Tm yield) remains small.  No new Canadian or European mines currently project commercial output by 2030.  

• **Recycling & Secondary Sources:**  Allied supply could also come from recycling.  Rare-earth magnet recycling (e.g. from hard drives or wind turbines) is emerging but presently focuses on Nd/Dy rather than Tm.  Waste streams like phosphate fertilizer tailings are being studied: USGS found Florida phosphate ore contains REE levels “equal to or greater” than known global deposits, and acid leaching recovers most REEs ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=Phosphate%20ore%20is%20relatively%20soft,concerns%20than%20conventional%20REE%20mines)).  Demonstrations have achieved 70–100% REE recovery from apatite tailings ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=from%20the%20apatite%20mineral%20contained,followed%20by%20acidic%20leaching%20and)), suggesting tailings could yield hundreds of tonnes of mixed REEs for 2030 supply.  However, separate Tm recovery from these streams will still be very minor (likely <10 t/yr from tailings).  

• **Combined Outlook:**  In a best-case 2030 scenario, U.S. domestic sources might supply on the order of 3,000–4,000 t/yr of total REE compounds (mostly Nd‐Pr from Mt. Pass and Utah, plus some Dy/Tm from new processing) ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Since%202020%2C%20Energy%20Fuels%20has,term%20on%20these%20critical%20elements)).  Australia adds ~18,000 t/yr (mostly light REEs) ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,100)).  If we assign ~1–2% of that combined allied output to thulium (reflecting its low crustal abundance), then US/allied Tm supply could be a few tens of tonnes per year by 2030.  In reality, my estimate is that even by 2030 **allied domestic Tm supply will remain <100 t/yr**, with the vast majority of U.S. and allied demand still met via imports or processing of allied-sourced REE ore.

## References for volumes

• **USGS Production Data:**  The USGS reports gave 2022 mine production as US 43,000 t REO and Australia 18,000 t ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,100)) (70% of world was 210,000 t).  No country outside China is listed as a Tm producer.  

• **Expected Demand (tonnes):**  Statista (2014) projected global thulium oxide demand (excluding China) would hit 119 t by 2017 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/450129/global-reo-thulium-oxide-demand-outside-of-china-forecast/#:~:text=This%20statistic%20displays%20the%20total,119%20metric%20tons%20in%202017)).  Using that baseline, one might project ~200–300 t by 2030 if growth continues.  Independent analysts note that “demand for medical and defense technologies ensures … stable supply” of thulium ([ptoe.com](https://ptoe.com/thulium-the-hidden-heavyweight-of-rare-earths/#:~:text=Due%20to%20its%20rarity%20and,in%20securing%20a%20stable%20supply)), underscoring a strong demand increase despite tiny current volumes.  

• **Resource Assessments:**  USGS research found U.S. phosphate ore contains REE grades “equal to or greater” than the world’s major deposits ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=Phosphate%20ore%20is%20relatively%20soft,concerns%20than%20conventional%20REE%20mines)).  Florida industry estimates suggest domestic reserves could meet >50% of U.S. critical-REE demand ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=Amid%20this%20effort%20to%20expand,earth%20minerals)). These figures imply that U.S. annual Tm demand is quite small (so small that the waste alone could supply it ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=not%20in%20the%20ground%2C%20but,phosphate%20industry%20byproducts%20like%20phosphogypsum))).  

• **Recovery Studies:**  Hydrometallurgy tests recovered 70–100% of REEs from apatite tailings (with solvent extraction and crystallization) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=from%20the%20apatite%20mineral%20contained,followed%20by%20acidic%20leaching%20and)).

## Key Discovery Technologies

• **Airborne Radiometric Surveys:**  Many thulium-hosting minerals (monazite, xenotime) contain thorium or uranium.  Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry can directly detect these markers.  USGS studies (e.g. Force *et al.*, 1982, USGS PP 1218) demonstrated that aeroradiometric mapping identified heavy-mineral placer sands (monazite/xenotime) in the Southeast US ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-and-geochemical-approaches-evaluating-rare-earth-element-ree#:~:text=Force%2C%20E,3133%2Fpp1218)).  By extension, modern UAV or fixed-wing radiometric surveys over prospective terranes (coastal plains, ancient river deltas) can highlight Th/U anomalous zones that likely carry heavy REEs including thulium.  

• **Geological Mapping (Carbonatite/Pegmatite Targeting):**  Thulium is often concentrated in rare-earth-bearing intrusives. Prospective lithologies include carbonatites (e.g. Mt. Weld, Australia) and peralkaline intrusions.  Field mapping identifies these units; geologists focus on outcrops of carbonatite (rich in calcite and REE minerals) or alkaline syenites.  Petrographic and XRF analysis of cuttings can confirm presence of monazite/xenotime.  (For instance, the USGS’s Jefferies 2010 deposit model emphasizes targeting carbonatite+peralkaline complexes for REEs ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/sir20105070J#:~:text=A%20deposit%20model%20for%20carbonatite,3133%2Fsir20105070J%20Metrics)).)  

• **Stream‐Sediment and Soil Geochemistry:**  Systematic sampling of streams and soils downstream of known carbonatite or heavy-mineral sources can passively accumulate REE.  Chemical assays (ICP-MS) on stream sediments can reveal subtle thulium anomalies.  USGS work in the southeastern US noted that trace REE measurements in soils/streams often correlate with nearby heavy-mineral lenses ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-and-geochemical-approaches-evaluating-rare-earth-element-ree#:~:text=Geochemical%20Data%20Analyses%3A%C2%A0Objectives%20were%20to,further%20geochemical%20and%20mineralogical%20analysis)).  Anomalies in yttrium/ytterbium in stream geochemistry are especially indicative of xenotime (and by inference thulium) upstream ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/gggsc/science/geophysical-and-geochemical-approaches-evaluating-rare-earth-element-ree#:~:text=field%20efforts,further%20geochemical%20and%20mineralogical%20analysis)).  

• **Magnetic/Gravity Surveys:**  Carbonatites and intrusive REE deposits often have distinct geophysical signatures.  Aero-magnetic surveys can detect magnetite-associated intrusives (some carbonatites are weakly magnetic) or delineate intrusive bodies.  Gravity surveys can detect dense (igneous) bodies.  While not specific to thulium, these methods help locate host intrusions.  

• **Drilling and Downhole Logging:**  Once targets are identified, core drilling with gamma/probe logging can directly measure Th content.  For example, drilling at a Th-bearing placer will often see spikes in Th/U gamma counts where monazite is present.  This confirms subsurface thulium-bearing mineralization.

## Key Extraction Technologies

• **Physical Separation of Ore:**  Extracting thulium begins with conventional mining and beneficiation.  Heavy-mineral sands (monazite/xenotime placers) can be mined via dredging or dry trenching.  Gravity separation (spiral concentrators, shaking tables) exploits the high density of monazite/xenotime.  Frac-flotation is often used to remove unwanted gangue (e.g. quartz, feldspar) while enriching REE minerals.  Magnetic separation (high-intensity rare-earth magnets or eddy currents) can further concentrate paramagnetic monazite from diamagnetic silicates.  These physical steps produce a heavy-mineral concentrate containing thulium-bearing minerals.  

• **Acid Leaching:**  The concentrate is then chemically leached.  For oxide concentrates (monazite), dilute hot sulfuric or hydrochloric acid is often used to dissolve the rare-earth phosphate/oxide minerals.  In US phosphate recovery work, for example, simple water or weak acid liberated REEs from phosphate rock “quite easily” ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=Phosphate%20ore%20is%20relatively%20soft,concerns%20than%20conventional%20REE%20mines)).  Florida researchers specifically note that Florida phosphate ore is soft and dissolves readily, allowing REEs to be released with minimal grinding ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=Phosphate%20ore%20is%20relatively%20soft,concerns%20than%20conventional%20REE%20mines)).  If the ore contains carbonates (e.g. carbonatites), dilute HCl can dissolve calcite and open up grains.  For clays (ion-adsorption style, not common outside China), acid washing leaches REEs into solution.  

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):**  The aqueous leachate containing all dissolved lanthanides (including thulium) is subjected to solvent extraction.  Multistage SX using organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, PC-88A, or Cyanex 272) separates REEs from base elements.  Energy Fuels, for example, has built a commercial SX circuit at White Mesa (Utah) to produce Nd–Pr oxide and intends to adapt it for heavy REEs ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Since%202020%2C%20Energy%20Fuels%20has,term%20on%20these%20critical%20elements)).  In principle, the leach liquor is fed to a series of mixer-settlers or countercurrent barrels: each stage selectively strips out lanthanides from the aqueous into an organic, then back-extracts them at higher acidity or with strip chemistry.  Variations include ionic-liquid or polymeric SX systems.  

• **Ion Exchange and Polymers:**  As an alternative to SX, chelating ion-exchange resins or polymer sorbents can recover REEs from solution.  One U.S. development uses a polymer (maleic anhydride-based) added to phosphoric acid leach liquor: this polymer selectively binds REEs (including thulium) and can be recycled to strip them off ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=not%20in%20the%20ground%2C%20but,phosphate%20industry%20byproducts%20like%20phosphogypsum)).  Such “solid-phase extraction” cartridges or columns can capture and concentrate REEs, after which a desorption step (acid rinse) produces an REE-rich solution.   

• **Precipitation:**  After SX or ion-exchange, purified rare-earth solutions are neutralized or reacted to precipitate oxalates, hydroxides, carbonates, or fluorides.  For example, adding NH₄OH might precipitate rare-earth hydroxides; adding H₂C₂O₄ yields rare-earth oxalates.  These precipitates can be calcined to produce REE oxides (Tm₂O₃, etc.) or further refined.

## Key Separation Technologies

• **Solvent Extraction Sequencing:**  To isolate thulium from other lanthanides, multiple SX stages are needed.  Specialized extractant combinations and pH adjustment schemes fractionate heavy REEs.  For example, lab studies show that supported liquid membranes with D2EHPA preferentially transport heavy rare earths (Gd–Lu) at high acidity ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c03268#:~:text=system%20of%20REEs%20using%20hollow,extractant%20since%20this%20increases%20the)).  In practice, U.S. heavy-REE projects plan multi-stage SX circuits: one stage strips total heavy-REE, and downstream stages progressively enrich the lightest (Gd/Dy) from the heaviest (Ho–Tm).  Counter-current or mixer-settler arrangements allow >99% separation over many stages.  Patented flowsheets even include oxidative steps (see below) to tweak chemistry for pairs like Gd/Tm.  

• **Supported Liquid Membranes (SLMs):**  As an advanced option, hollow-fiber or flat-sheet SLMs impregnated with extractant have been piloted.  KTH (Sweden) demonstrated that a D2EHPA-based hollow-fiber membrane extracts lanthanides with very high selectivity: heavy REEs pass preferentially under optimal pH ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c03268#:~:text=system%20of%20REEs%20using%20hollow,extractant%20since%20this%20increases%20the)).  An SLM unit can continuously draw rare earths out of aqueous feed into an organic and then into a stripping solution, potentially concentrating thulium in a single step.  This technology is still emerging (pilot-scale demonstrated) but could shorten the SX train for heavy lanthanides.  

• **Chromatographic Ion Exchange:**  Ion-exchange columns (e.g. using chelating resins) could also separate REEs.  In practice, this is more common for purifying specific lanthanides after most coarser separation is done.  Anion or cation exchange chromatography has been demonstrated at lab scale to resolve lanthanides, but it is not widely used industrially due to slow throughput.  A variant is chromatographic chromatography (counter-current solvent or resin strips) to sharpen purity of final Thulium fractions.  

• **Chemical Redox Separation:**  One specialized method uses redox chemistry to separate lanthanide pairs.  For example, a U.S. patent describes dissolving a Gd–Tm mixture and electrolytically reducing Tm^3+ to Tm^2+.  The reduced Tm^2+ has greatly increased magnetic susceptibility, allowing a magnetic separator to pull out the Tm from Gd ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=match%20at%20L1405%20,and%20separation%20can%20be%20made)).  This clever trick (transforming only thulium to the +2 state) effectively splits Gd/Tm, a pair notoriously difficult to separate by SX.  Another approach is fractional crystallization: changing temperature/pH so that one lanthanide precipitates first.  (These methods are still largely experimental.)  

• **Fluorination/Volatilization:**  Once high-purity Tm (as oxide) is obtained, further separation from Yb/Lu can be done by forming volatile chloride or fluoride and distilling.  Thulium oxychloride, for instance, sublimes at a lower temperature than ytterbium, allowing physical separation.  Vacuum distillation or zone refinement of the metal can also increase purity if needed.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies

• **Metallothermic Reduction:**  To make thulium metal, the purified Tm₂O₃ (oxide) is typically reduced by an active metal.  The common route is calciothermic or aluminothermic reduction in molten CaCl₂ or MgCl₂.  For example, molten salt electrolysis cells (Martin’s electrolytic dye cell or modern ceramic electrolyzers) can produce Tm metal directly by reducing TmCl₃ at a cathode (as is done for other lanthanides) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=match%20at%20L1405%20,and%20separation%20can%20be%20made)).  The US DOE’s pyro-reduction reactors (e.g. at Idaho National Lab) use molten LiCl–KCl with a reactive metal (Ca or Li) to strip oxygen.  Such “electrowinning” yields sponge or ingots of thulium metal.  

• **Vacuum Distillation and Refining:**  The crude thulium metal from reduction, though >99% pure, can be further purified by distillation.  In vacuum (or inert atmosphere) electrodes or boats, thulium’s vapor pressure is exploited: impurities with higher or lower vapor pressures separate on cooling.  Zone refining of solid metal is also possible: a narrow molten zone traverses a thulium ingot to segregate residual impurities.  These metallurgical steps produce high-purity thulium metal or master alloy (e.g. Tm–Sm alloy for specialized magnets).  

• **Electrorefining:**  An alternative purification is to dissolve impure Tm metal in an appropriate molten salt (e.g. LiCl–KCl) and perform an electrolytic plating.  Impurities either remain in solution or stay at the anode, while pure Tm metal plates onto a cathode.  This has been described in patents for Gd/Tm separations ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=match%20at%20L1405%20,and%20separation%20can%20be%20made)) and is practiced (at smaller scale) for rare lanthanide refining.  

• **Hydrogen Decrepitation (HD):**  An interesting method to purify REE metals is hydrogen decrepitation.  In metals like Nd–Pr, hydrogen absorption causes brittle powders that break up intermetallics.  For Tm, a similar impact occurs: exposing thulium alloy to hydrogen can selectively hydrate any remaining oxyphides or nitrides, which can be removed.  (This is a niche approach, but it has been reported for mixed-lanthanide purification.)

## Key Remediation Technologies

• **Tailings and Waste Reprocessing:**  Rather than leaving wastes as inert tailings, allied projects plan to treat wastes as secondary resources.  For example, apatite (phosphate) mine tailings in Florida contain significant heavy-REE minerals.  A hydrometallurgical pilot recovered 70–100% of REEs from such tailings using acid leaching plus SX ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0178-0#:~:text=from%20the%20apatite%20mineral%20contained,followed%20by%20acidic%20leaching%20and)).  Applying this to thulium means tailings can be leached (often with sulphuric acid), capturing Tm in solution for SX.  This both “remediates” (reduces) waste stockpiles and adds thulium to supply.  

• **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Control:**  If REE mining produces acidic effluents (e.g. from heap leach or flotation), treatment is required.  Common practice is neutralization: adding lime or limestone to precipitate metals as hydroxides/carbonates.  In this process, any dissolved thorium or uranium (often co-mined with heavy REEs) can co-precipitate, removing radioactivity.  The precipitated rare earths (e.g. as carbonate) can sometimes be recycled back into the extraction process, minimizing Tm loss.  

• **Chelating Polymers and Bioadsorption:**  Novel remediation uses include adding chelating polymers or biopolymers to polluted water to bind REEs.  As noted above, a proprietary polymer (maleic acid-based) is added to phosphoric acid plant water to capture dissolved metals ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=not%20in%20the%20ground%2C%20but,phosphate%20industry%20byproducts%20like%20phosphogypsum)).  Similarly, engineered bacteria or algae can uptake thulium from solution.  These approaches can cleanse effluent streams while concentrating Tm for recovery.  

• **Dust and Radionuclide Capture:**  Heavy-REE ores often carry radioisotopes.  For example, Florida’s phosphogypsum stacks accumulate radium and thorium.  Remediation technology includes capping stacks and vacuuming radon.  Importantly, recovering REEs before stacking (as per Florida’s polymer approach) “reduces the amount of waste going into stacks, lowering radiation risks” ([www.miamiherald.com](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article276607541.html#:~:text=Mining%20companies%20like%20Mosaic%20would,size%20and%20capacity%20of%20the)).  This means that extracting Tm upstream not only yields metal but also mitigates hazardous waste.  

• **Resource Recycling:**  Finally, end-of-life recycling closes the loop.  Thulium from spent lasers, circuit boards, or magnets can be recovered by chemical dissolution (HCl digestion) and normal SX flows.  Though current volumes are tiny, designing manufacturing for recycling (e.g. magnetic separators to sort REE lamps) ensures that little Tm is lost to landfill.

## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production

The **primary bottleneck** is *separation and purification of thulium within heavy-REE processing chains*.  Thulium’s chemistry is extremely similar to its lanthanide neighbors (like holmium, ytterbium, lutetium), so isolating it requires many specialized steps.  In practice, only China has had large-scale facilities for heavy-REE separation.  Allied efforts (e.g. Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill) are only now demonstrating multi-stage SX flowsheets for “mid” and “heavy” oxides ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Since%202020%2C%20Energy%20Fuels%20has,term%20on%20these%20critical%20elements)).  Absent new chemistry, designs must use dozens of extraction stages or novel tricks (e.g. electrolytic reduction to magnetically separate Gd/Tm ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=match%20at%20L1405%20,and%20separation%20can%20be%20made))).  Thus, the **bottleneck technology** is advanced hydrometallurgical processing (SX/ion-exchange) specifically tailored for heavy prime-lanthanides. Without it, domestic production of Tm on any commercial scale is essentially impossible.

^(See e.g. Energy Fuels CEO remarks on heavy-REE SX ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Since%202020%2C%20Energy%20Fuels%20has,term%20on%20these%20critical%20elements)); USGS/DERA emphasis on China’s monopoly of “heavy” REEs ([natural-resources.canada.ca](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/rare-earth-elements-facts#:~:text=,resources%20to%20the%20marketplace%20continue)).) 

## Key Bottleneck Summary

Thulium lies at the end of the heavy lanthanide series, so the core bottleneck is *refining it out of mixed rare-earth oxides*.  Even if new mines provide heavy-REE concentrate, extracting pure Tm requires complex multi-stage solvent-extraction or equivalent separation schemes ([www.prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-based-energy-fuels-poised-to-produce-six-of-the-seven-rare-earth-oxides-now-subject-to-chinese-export-controls-at-scale-302431466.html#:~:text=Since%202020%2C%20Energy%20Fuels%20has,term%20on%20these%20critical%20elements)) ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20140166788A1/en#:~:text=match%20at%20L1405%20,and%20separation%20can%20be%20made)).  In allied nations, such heavy-REE refining capacity is virtually nonexistent at present, making the hydrometallurgical separation process the critical limiting technology.  No shortcut exists: producing high-purity thulium onshore depends on deploying these advanced separation flowsheets at scale.
