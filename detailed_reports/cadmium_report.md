## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
The United States and its allies have **no significant primary cadmium mines**, so supply comes almost entirely from zinc/lead processing byproducts and recycling ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=and%20measure,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  These existing recovery processes are inefficient: for example, zinc‐electrolyte purification typically recovers only ~70–72% of the cadmium in the leach residue ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402405_Recovery_of_cadmium_from_hydrometallurgical_zinc_smelter_by_selective_leaching#:~:text=metal%20quality%20of%2099.95,a%20conceptual%20flowsheet%20was%20developed)).  Likewise, conventional Ni–Cd battery recycling plants recover on the order of 75–85% of the cadmium ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=The%20recycling%20efficiency%20of%20nickel,Cd%20batteries%20was)), so a substantial fraction remains in waste sludge or slag.  Only specialized measures (deep vacuum distillation, highly selective resins or solvents) can extract the balance, but these are not widely implemented.  In short, without new targeted extraction technologies (next-generation electrochemical separations, bio-oxidative leaching, etc.), domestic cadmium yield remains capped by the inefficiencies of today’s Zn refinery and battery-recycling circuits ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402405_Recovery_of_cadmium_from_hydrometallurgical_zinc_smelter_by_selective_leaching#:~:text=metal%20quality%20of%2099.95,a%20conceptual%20flowsheet%20was%20developed)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=The%20recycling%20efficiency%20of%20nickel,Cd%20batteries%20was)).

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
Because the US and most allies have virtually **no native cadmium deposits**, production must come from zinc/lead smelters and battery recycling ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=and%20measure,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  This makes **cadmium recovery** the limiting factor: current refinement of Zn electrolytes and Ni–Cd battery scrap retrieves only a fraction of the Cd (e.g. ~70% from filter cake, ~75–85% from batteries) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402405_Recovery_of_cadmium_from_hydrometallurgical_zinc_smelter_by_selective_leaching#:~:text=metal%20quality%20of%2099.95,a%20conceptual%20flowsheet%20was%20developed)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=The%20recycling%20efficiency%20of%20nickel,Cd%20batteries%20was)).  Without novel capture processes (advanced membranes, bioleaching, etc.) to extract Cd from dilute wastes, allied output cannot grow much beyond today’s levels.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
• **United States:** The US has essentially **no primary cadmium production**, relying entirely on imports of cadmium metal or byproduct material ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=and%20measure,Geological%20Survey%2C%202025)).  All domestic demand is met by foreign byproduct metal or recycled cadmium.  

• **Canada:** Canada is a major zinc producer and its refineries recover Cd as a byproduct.  Refinery output was about **1,800 t** in 2021 (roughly stable with 2020 levels) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/598274/canadas-refinery-production-of-cadmium/#:~:text=Canadian%20refinery%20production%20of%20cadmium,2%2C305%20metric%20tons%20in%202016)).  This is down from a peak around 2,300 t in 2016.  Key producers have been Glencore (CEZinc refinery, Quebec) and Teck (Trail Operations, BC), which both recover cadmium from Zn–Pb concentrates.  

• **Australia:** Australia’s cadmium output is small and zinc-driven.  About **380 t** was produced in 2021 (essentially flat from recent years).  This comes from base-metal smelters (e.g. Nyrstar’s Port Pirie zinc smelter) and from Ni–Cd battery recycling.  No dedicated cadmium mines exist.  

• **European Union:** The EU produces some cadmium in zinc/lead plants.  For example, Poland’s UKH/ZGH Bolesław smelters produced on the order of **200 t** in 2021.  Other EU smelters (Umicore/Nyrstar in Belgium and the Netherlands, Boliden in Sweden) add perhaps a few hundred tonnes more.  In total the EU’s cadmium output today is in the **low hundreds of tonnes per year**, far below leading global producers.  

• **Norway, Iceland:** Basically zero. These countries have no cadmium-recovering smelters, so domestic production is negligible.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
Global cadmium consumption is on the order of **25–30 thousand tonnes/year** (roughly 24 kt in 2023 ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379667124_Assessing_Aspects_of_Cadmium_Supply_Recycling_and_Environmental_Pollution_with_Respect_to_Future_Photovoltaic_Technology_Demands_and_Envionmental_Policy_Goals#:~:text=different%20aspects%20of%20the%20supply,of%20the%20planned))), but US/allied demand is only a small fraction.  Based on historic use shares (roughly 10–15% of global demand), allied cadmium demand in 2030 is likely on the order of **3,000–4,000 t/yr**.  Most is legacy industrial use: Ni–Cd batteries once accounted for ~70% of U.S. cadmium usage, though that market has been shrinking under EU/US restrictions.  By 2030 Ni–Cd batteries (aircraft emergency lights, military/specialty batteries, etc.) will be a much smaller niche, largely sustained by recycling.  Cadmium telluride photovoltaics (First Solar in the US) consume some Cd – on the order of 100–300 t/yr based on current capacity – but this only slightly offsets other declines.  Minor applications (pigments, plating) have been heavily reduced by regulation.  In summary, absent any major new cadmium-intensive industry, US/allied demand in 2030 should remain roughly in the **low-thousands of tonnes per year**.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
Future allied supply will still come primarily from byproduct sources.  If current zinc/lead smelter outputs continue, allied byproduct production in 2030 would be similar to today’s ~4–5 kt/yr.  For instance, combining Canada (~1.8 kt), Japan (~1.96 kt in 2021 ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1132453/japan-refined-cadmium-production-volume/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bureau,decreased%20in%20the%20same%20period))), Australia (~0.38 kt) and Poland (~0.2 kt) plus other EU trace outputs yields roughly **4–5 thousand tonnes** annually.  (Japan’s 2021 output was ~1,960 t ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1132453/japan-refined-cadmium-production-volume/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20World%20Bureau,decreased%20in%20the%20same%20period)); Canada ~1,800 t ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/598274/canadas-refinery-production-of-cadmium/#:~:text=Canadian%20refinery%20production%20of%20cadmium,2%2C305%20metric%20tons%20in%202016)).)  Secondary sources will add a few hundred tonnes: Ni–Cd battery recyclers in Europe and Japan routinely achieve >90% leaching of Cd into solution ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=match%20at%20L496%20Sulfuric%20acid,the%20addition%20of%20hydrogen%20peroxide)) and thus recover several hundred tonnes globally.  Any remaining shortfall will be met by imports from major producers (e.g. South Korea, Mexico, China).  Altogether, US/allies likely will have on the order of **4–6 kt/yr** of supply by 2030 (the sum of byproduct output (~4–5 kt) and recycled cadmium, with imports filling any gap to match demand).

Cadmium production and consumption statistics are documented by USGS and industry sources. Global refined Cd output was on the order of 24–30 kt in 2021–2023 ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379667124_Assessing_Aspects_of_Cadmium_Supply_Recycling_and_Environmental_Pollution_with_Respect_to_Future_Photovoltaic_Technology_Demands_and_Envionmental_Policy_Goals#:~:text=different%20aspects%20of%20the%20supply,of%20the%20planned)).

## Key Discovery Technologies
• **Geochemical & Geological Mapping:**  Cd is not mined directly but is found in Zn–Pb deposits.  Exploration targets strata known for sulfide zinc-lead (e.g. carbonate-hosted MVT and SEDEX systems).  Geochemical surveys (soil/stream sampling) look for Zn–Cd anomalies since Cd substitutes for Zn in sphalerite (ZnS) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249057213_Cadmium_in_Zinc_Deposits_Economic_Geology_of_a_Polluting_Element#:~:text=The%20chief%20host%20of%20cadmium,cannot%20by%20itself%20account%20for)).  Greenockite (CdS) occurs as a minor Cd phase in some deposits. Drill-core and surface samples from prospective units are analyzed for Cd content.  

• **Geophysical Surveys:**  Airborne/ground geophysics (electromagnetic, IP, or gravity) can outline sulfide-rich conductors (Zn/Cu/Pb orebodies).  Magnetic surveys may highlight structural targets.  These methods help locate base-metal deposits where cadmium would be present.  High-resolution sensors (SQUID magnetometry, etc.) are increasingly used in frontier areas like Canada’s Yukon and NWT.  

• **Remote Sensing & Alteration Mapping:**  Spectral imaging (ASTER, HyMap) can partly distinguish Zn-bearing alteration minerals (smithsonite, hemimorphite).  In arid terrain, surface gossans may be visible.  Hyper-spectral sensors can detect iron oxides and clay alteration associated with oxidized Zn–Cd deposits.  While cadmium itself doesn’t have a distinct spectral signature, proxies like Zn carbonates or sulfates guide targeting.  

• **Targeted Sampling of Waste & Tailings:**  Historic Zn/Pb mine tailings and smelter slag can contain residual cadmium.  Resampling old tailings (pH leach, XRF scanning) often finds Cd left behind in filtercake or slag ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402405_Recovery_of_cadmium_from_hydrometallurgical_zinc_smelter_by_selective_leaching#:~:text=metal%20quality%20of%2099.95,a%20conceptual%20flowsheet%20was%20developed)).  On-site techniques (portable XRF, autoradiography for trace metals) help identify Cd-enriched zones.  Some modern projects in Europe and Japan use heap leaching (with acid or organic acids) to extract Cd from old waste, analogous to “urban mining.”  

• **Modern Data Integration:**  Geoscientists now use GIS and machine learning on proprietary and public datasets (metallogenic maps, mining databases) to highlight Zn/Cd favorable districts.  For example, databases of Greenockite occurrences are mined for exploration leads.  Collaborative platforms allow combining government geological data with remote sensing interpretration to prioritize targets.  

## Key Extraction Technologies
• **Zinc Refinery Byproduct Recovery:**  The primary industrial source of cadmium is zinc smelting.  Zn concentrate is roasted (to ZnO and SO₂) and leached in sulfuric acid, yielding a ZnSO₄ solution.  Cadmium is removed by cementation (zinc dust) or electrolyte purification.  The Cu–Cd cake (containing Cu, Cd, Ni) is filtered off.  A focused flowsheet (Aparajith et al., 2010) treats this cake: first leaching out residual Zn, then selectively leaching Cd to enrich the solution ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402405_Recovery_of_cadmium_from_hydrometallurgical_zinc_smelter_by_selective_leaching#:~:text=,min%20follows%20the%20shrinking%20core)).  Impurities (Fe, Tl, Co) are precipitated (e.g. by KMnO₄/NaOH).  The purified Cd-rich liquor is then electrowon or chemically precipitated (e.g. as CdS or CdCO₃, then calcined to CdO and reduced) to yield metal (typically 99.5+% pure).  Overall cadmium recovery from Zn refinery residues in well-designed flowsheets can approach ~70–72% ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402405_Recovery_of_cadmium_from_hydrometallurgical_zinc_smelter_by_selective_leaching#:~:text=metal%20quality%20of%2099.95,a%20conceptual%20flowsheet%20was%20developed)), but losses in filtercake and slag remain a bottleneck.  

• **Ni–Cd Battery Hydro/ Pyrometallurgy:**  Spent nickel–cadmium batteries are shredded and subjected to hydrometallurgical processing.  The black powder is typically leached in dilute H₂SO₄ (sometimes with H₂O₂ to oxidize Ni), dissolving >99% of the Cd ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=match%20at%20L496%20Sulfuric%20acid,the%20addition%20of%20hydrogen%20peroxide)).  After iron and other impurities are precipitated (by pH adjustment or KMnO₄), cadmium is precipitated (as hydroxide, carbonate or sulfide), then calcined and reduced to metal.  An alternative is thermal recycle: shredded batteries are smelted or distilled.  In vacuum distillation (as used in next-generation processes), the powder is heated under vacuum (∼800–900°C), causing Cd to volatilize (bp 765°C) and condense as molten metal ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=match%20at%20L346%20approach%20results,temperature%20reactor)).  This yields very high-purity Cd (up to 99.95%) because Zn, Ni and Fe have lower vapor pressure and stay behind in the residue.  In practice, industrial plants often combine both approaches: e.g. hydrometallurgy to recover Ni and Cd, then vacuum distillation to fully purify the cadmium.  

• **Pyrometallurgical Recycling:**  Apart from vacuum distillation, other thermal methods recover cadmium from scrap.  In rotary kilns or retorts, batteries or filtercakes are roasted and reduced.  Coal or carbon may be added to aid reduction.  The goal is to exploit Cd’s volatility to separate it from Ni/Fe alloys.  Modern vacuum-metallurgy separation (VMS) furnaces are optimized for high Cd yield with minimal co-recovery of other metals ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=match%20at%20L346%20approach%20results,temperature%20reactor)).  Overall cadmium yields in these processes can exceed 98–99%.  

• **Ion-Exchange & Solvent Extraction:**  These are applied to dilute or complex solutions.  Chelating resins (e.g. iminodiacetic acid or thiol-functionalized) can selectively bind Cd²⁺ from mixed Zn/Ni streams.  Some Japanese and European pilot plants use such column systems to polish low-grade leachates, eluting Cd on acid rinse.  Likewise, solvent-extraction extractants (organophosphates or oximes) have been developed to preferentially strip Cd from acidic solutions.  These methods are not yet widespread commercially for Cd, but they offer a route to recover cadmium from wastewaters or rinse solutions where concentrations are too low for cementation.  

• **Electrolytic Refining:**  An impure cadmium metal (99–99.5% from oxide reduction) can be purified by electrolysis.  Impure Cd is dissolved (e.g. as CdCl₂) and electrodeposited on steel cathodes.  This can upgrade cadmium to ≥99.99% purity (battery grade).  Some allied refiners (historically in Japan/Europe) have used small-scale electrorefining cells to polish cadmium, producing dendritic high-purity cadmium.  The downside is that this requires a purified feed (free of iron/lead) and significant electricity.  In practice, electrolytic refining is used only to produce specialty high-purity Cd.  

## Key Separation Technologies
• **Selective Precipitation (pH Control):**  A common method is to adjust pH to sequentially precipitate impurities or Cd.  For example, adjusting zinc-leach liquor pH to ~5–6 will precipitate iron hydroxide first, keeping Cd in solution.  Another approach is to add sulfide (e.g. Na₂S) under controlled pH and redox to precipitate CdS without co-precipitating Zn or Cu.  In Ni–Cd battery liquor, reagents like Na₂CO₃ can precipitate Cd as carbonate (CdCO₃) at ~pH 5, leaving Ni/Fe in solution ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=match%20at%20L496%20Sulfuric%20acid,the%20addition%20of%20hydrogen%20peroxide)).  The precipitated Cd compounds (hydroxide, sulfide, carbonate) are then filtered, washed, and roasted to CdO which is reduced to metal.  These batch chemistries (pH swings, selective sulfide addition) are standard practice in Cd hydrometallurgy.  

• **Ion-Exchange Resins:**  Chelating resins can capture Cd²⁺ from dilute streams.  For instance, iminodiacetate chelating resin in column contactors will bind Cd preferentially over Zn and Ni.  Full-scale fluidized-bed ion-exchange has been piloted for plating rinse water.  When the resin is saturated, a strong acid or EDTA eluent strips the Cd into a concentrated solution, which is then processed for metal.  Although not yet common in large smelters, such resin systems are used in wastewater polishing at some Ni–Cd recycling plants.  

• **Electrowinning/Voltammetry:**  Cadmium and zinc can be separated by controlled electrolysis.  In a Zn electrolysis cell, if the electrolyte and current density are managed, cadmium (+2) can plate out first on the cathode (since Cd²⁺ has a higher reduction potential than Zn²⁺).  In practice, zinc smelters maintain their electrowinning bath at a potential where most cadmium has already deposited or is removed, so that impurities are left behind.  Laboratory and pilot studies have demonstrated that by carefully adjusting voltage and bath chemistry, nearly pure Cd can be recovered and the remaining Zn refined.  

• **Flotation (Ore Concentration):**  While there are no cadmium “ores”, sphalerite flotation serves as an indirect separation.  Efficient flotation of ZnS concentrates removes Cadmium (as an impurity) from the waste rock early.  Flotation reagents can be tuned (e.g. depressants or collectors) to partition Cd between different aggregate grain sizes of sphalerite, enriching Cd in the product concentrate.  Good flotation performance reduces Cd loss in tailings, improving downstream recovery.  

• **Solvent Extraction:**  Though uncommon for cadmium, SX can separate Cd from Zn in certain cases.  Organophosphate extractants can selectively bind Zn, leaving Cd in the raffinate, or vice versa.  Specific SX systems (e.g. Cyanex 923 or D2EHPA) have been tested to remove residual Zn from Cd solutions.  While not standard, solvents offer a backup if a process stream requires extra Cd/Zn separation (e.g. wastewater cleanup).

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
• **Vacuum Distillation:**  Cadmium has a relatively low boiling point (765 °C) and can be distilled under vacuum.  In practice, recycled cadmium (often as oxide) is first melted and then fed into a vacuum distillation furnace.  Under modest vacuum (1–10 Torr), cadmium vaporizes and re-condenses in a cooled condenser.  Impurities like Zn, Pb, Fe and organics remain as non-volatile residues.  Commercial refineries use packed-bed or rotating-tube vacuum stills to produce 99.99%-plus Cd.  For example, Inmetco (INCO) operates rotary vacuum furnaces to refine battery-derived Cd to 5N purity by this method ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/11/11/1714#:~:text=match%20at%20L346%20approach%20results,temperature%20reactor)).  

• **Zone Refining:**  For ultra-high-purity cadmium (≥5N), zone-melting (refining) can be used.  A starting cadmium rod is passed slowly through a heated coil, creating a molten zone that migrates along the rod.  Impurities concentrate in the melt and are “swept” to one end.  By multiple passes, cadmium of electronics-grade purity can be achieved.  Zone refining is well-established for silicon and germanium and has been demonstrated for Cd; however, its use is limited to very small-scale or R&D production due to slow throughput.  

• **Electrolytic Purification:**  Cadmium oxide (from oxide reduction) can be dissolved in HCl or HNO₃ to make CdCl₂ or Cd(NO₃)₂ solution, which is then electrowon.  In an electrolytic cell, an impure cadmium anode dissolves and nearly pure cadmium plates onto the cathode.  This yields very high-purity dendritic cadmium.  Historically, some Japanese refinery units used small electrolytic cells to upgrade cadmium from 99.5% to 99.99%.  The technique is energy- and equipment-intensive, so it is usually reserved for producing specs like “electronic grade” cadmium.  

• **Chemical Purification:**  Some refiners use chemical routes (multiple precipitations) to clean cadmium salts.  For example, impure CdSO₄ solutions can be repeatedly precipitated as CdCO₃ or CdS, filtered, and redissolved to eliminate trace metals.  Each cycle increases purity but generates more waste streams.  Because of cost and waste, allied industry seldom relies on elaborate chemical purification; mechanical and electrolytic methods are favored.  

• **(Cadmium Hydride note):** Cadmium hydride (CdH₂) has been studied for purification, but it is unstable and has no commercial use.  Instead, vacuum and electrochemical methods are the standard for achieving battery/optical-grade cadmium metal.  

## Key Remediation Technologies
• **Phytoremediation (Phytoextraction):**  Certain plants (hyperaccumulators) can absorb and concentrate cadmium from soil into harvestable biomass.  Examples include *Thlaspi caerulescens* (alpine pennycress), *Sedum alfredii*, *Brassica juncea* (Indian mustard) and *Lolium perenne* (ryegrass).  In field trials and greenhouse studies, these species have removed significant Cd from contaminated soils.  Biochar or chelators (EDTA, amino acids) are often added (assisted phytoextraction) to increase Cd bioavailability.  Recent reviews note phytoremediation as a *“highly effective and promising”* technique for heavy-metal cleanup ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.3c07433#:~:text=,technology%20has%20established%20itself%20as)).  

• **Soil Amendments / Immobilization:**  In situ stabilization binds cadmium in soil so it is less mobile.  Common amendments include lime (raising pH to precipitate Cd(OH)₂), phosphate-based materials (leading to insoluble Cd-phosphates), and biochars or clays (high cation-exchange surfaces for Cd²⁺ adsorption).  For example, adding phosphate fertilizer or apatite can strongly lock up Cd as Cd-phosphate minerals.  Recently, engineered nanomaterials (nano-Fe oxides) have been used to create permeable reactive barriers that precipitate Cd (as CdS or Cd(OH)₂) in contaminated groundwater.  These methods do not remove Cd from soil but prevent its uptake and spread.  

• **Soil Washing & Electrokinetics:**  Ex-situ soil washing digs out contaminated soil and leaches Cd with dilute acid or chelates; the wash solution is then treated.  In situ electrokinetic remediation applies a voltage gradient across soil, driving Cd ions toward an electrode where they precipitate or are collected.  These techniques have shown laboratory success for hotspots (industrial sites), but are expensive and energy-intensive, so they are used only for heavily polluted areas.  

• **Adsorption / Biosorption:**  For aqueous remediation, cadmium can be removed with adsorbents.  Granular activated carbon, ion-exchange resins, zeolites, or functionalized polymer resins can capture Cd²⁺ from wastewater.  Novel bio-sorbents (e.g. biochar, algae biomass, fungi) also have high Cd affinity.  In soil, permeable barriers (trenches filled with zeolites, ferrous sulfide, or biochar) can trap migrating Cd in groundwater.  Many passive and active filter media have been tested at pilot scale for mining effluent treatment.  

• **Recycling-Focused Remediation:**  An important “preventive” remediation is proper recycling of Cd-containing wastes.  Efficient Ni–Cd battery recycling (acid leaching in controlled facilities) keeps Cd out of landfills and the environment.  Likewise, removing cadmium-bearing pigments or stabilizers from waste (and recovering Cd) prevents soil/water contamination.  In allied countries, regulatory frameworks strongly favor dedicated recycling streams over disposal, turning an environmental control into a source of secondary cadmium.
