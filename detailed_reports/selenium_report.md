## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** ~0 (no active domestic production; historic producers (Asarco, Kennecott) ceased Se refining by the late 1990s ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=The%20U,Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997))).  
• **Canada:** on the order of **400–450 t/yr** (e.g. 423,832 kg exported in 2023 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Belgium%20%20%20,Kg)), largely byproduct from large copper operations like Teck’s Highland Valley).  
• **Australia:** negligible (~0.25 t in 2023 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Switzerland%20%20%20,Kg)); no primary Se mining, only trace byproduct).  
• **European Union (Allied members):** on the order of **500–700 t/yr**. For example, EU exports totaled ~609,216 kg in 2023 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=European%20Union%20%20%20,Kg)) (Belgium ~311,188 kg ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Belgium%20%20%20,Kg)), Germany ~303,469 kg ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=241%2C166%20%20,5%2C012.34))). These flows imply similar-scale domestic output (from specialty refiners/catalysts).  
• **Norway:** ~330–331 t/yr (330,951 kg exported in 2023 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Norway%20%20,Kg)), from its alumina/copper smelter processing).  
• **Iceland:** ~0 (no selenium production).  
• **Japan:** ~680–690 t/yr (681,105 kg exported in 2023 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Japan%20%20%20,Kg)), reflecting production by Japanese refiners, e.g. Nihon Refine/Fukuoka and Nippon Rare Metals).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Forecast growth:** Global selenium demand is projected to rise to ~~4,320 t by 2030 (from ~3,500 t in 2025) ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/selenium-market#:~:text=The%20Selenium%20Market%20size%20is,2030)). Demand drivers include photovoltaics (CIGS solar cells), electronics, metallurgy (stainless steel catalysts), glass/pigments, and agriculture. Allied nations (US, Canada, EU, Japan) account for a substantial fraction of this market. For example, Europe’s expanding solar/automotive sectors and North American electronics/agriculture industries could each demand on the order of hundreds of tons per year by 2030 (roughly 15–30% of global). Japan’s technology sector (~10–20%) will also consume several hundred tons. A representative estimate might be **~1,500–2,200 t/yr** combined for US & allies by 2030 (consistent with ~4% CAGR to 2030 ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/selenium-market#:~:text=The%20Selenium%20Market%20size%20is,2030))).  
• **Per-sector detail:** In the US and EU, glass manufacturing and pigment industries typically use tens of tons/yr each (e.g. USGS estimated glass & pigments ~55% of US use in early 2000s ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=5))). Electronics and photovoltaic demand could add another ~50–100 t/yr in allies by 2030. Nutritional and feed additives (organic Se) remain modest (~10–20 t/yr). Key end users include companies like Saint-Gobain (glass), DuPont/Lanxess (sulfur-selenium film), and feed supplement producers. Technologies driving growth include perovskite/CIGS solar manufacturing (e.g. Tokyo Ohka Kogyo, Kaneka in Japan) and advanced photo-detector panels (Canon, Nikon).  
• **Imports reliance:** Given near-zero US production, virtually all US demand (estimated ~100–200 t/yr currently) will be import-dependent by 2030. Similarly, allied countries (even with some domestic output) will import additional Se to meet demand shortfalls.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Byproduct recovery:** Selenium supply remains tied to copper/refining byproducts. Allies with large Cu smelters can increase recovery. For example, the Finlayson Lake VMS district in Yukon (Canada) contains ~21.5 Mt of sulfide ore with mean ~700 g/t Se (max ~3420 g/t) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=Recently%2C%20selenium%20resources%20were%20reported,selenium%20in%20the%20Wolverine%20deposit)). If mined, this deposit alone could yield on the order of 10^4 t of Se (70,000+ t at peak grades). Similarly, minor Se recoveries are possible from tailings of old US mines if technology is applied. However, no major new copper smelters are planned in the US; thus domestic Se supply growth is limited.  
• **Recycling & secondary sources:** New supply avenues include recycling of spent electronics, CIGS solar panel waste, and selenium-bearing steel slags. Advanced recycling plants (e.g. Excellon’s metal recovery) might recover several tons annually by 2030, but these remain small-scale. Municipal and agricultural wastewater cleanup (see Remediation) could incidentally recover small Se quantities. Overall, allies’ 2030 domestic Se supply might reach **~500–1,000 t/yr** if all prospective byproducts are exploited (Far Eastern and European refineries, Finlayson development, and recycling), still well below projected demand. The gap will be met by imports.  
• **Example – Japan:** Japan’s Nippon Rare Metal and others may maintain ~600–700 t/yr output (similar to 2023) by recovering Se from imported copper slimes. Absent new mines, allied Se supply is largely capped by such byproduct limits.  

## References for volumes  
Sources on production volumes include trade data and industry reports. For example, Statista and WITS export data give 2023 outputs: Japan exported ~681,105 kg ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Japan%20%20%20,Kg)), Canada ~423,832 kg ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=Belgium%20%20%20,Kg)), EU ~609,216 kg in total ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/ALL/year/2023/tradeflow/Exports/partner/WLD/product/280490#:~:text=European%20Union%20%20%20,Kg)). USGS data note zero US production and historical figures ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=The%20U,Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)). Mordor Intelligence forecasts global demand 3,500 t (2025) rising to 4,320 t by 2030 ([www.mordorintelligence.com](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/selenium-market#:~:text=The%20Selenium%20Market%20size%20is,2030)). These underpin the above numeric estimates.  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geochemical prospecting:** Sampling and assaying of stream sediments, soils, and drill core in known Cu–Pb–Zn districts. Selenium anomalies (especially with Te, Bi, As) can flag mineralization. For example, exploration in Yukon’s Finlayson Lake VMS belt involved geologic mapping and analysis that revealed high Se content (up to 3,420 g/t Se in ore ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=Recently%2C%20selenium%20resources%20were%20reported,selenium%20in%20the%20Wolverine%20deposit))), guiding deposit delineation. Similarly, classical surveys in Germany’s Harz Mountains targeted silver-lead veins and identified Se-bearing minerals (clausthalite, naumannite) in polymetallic ores ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20selenide%20deposits%20in%20the,PbSe%29%2C%20naumannite)).  
• **Geophysical methods:** Airborne/ground EM and IP surveys to locate massive sulfide systems often rich in Se-bearing phases. Electromagnetic anomalies (e.g. TX or HLEM) can pinpoint massive sulphides at depth, later geochemically tested for Se. Gravity surveys can highlight dense sulphide accumulations. These are standard in Cu–Zn exploration (e.g. at Finlayson, historical VMS search).  
• **Geologic mapping & targeting:** Focus on lithologies known to host Se (e.g. black shales, felsic tuffs, sandstone-hosted uranium with Se). Detailed mapping of hydrothermal veins for selenide minerals (e.g. in North America’s uranium-selenium deposits or China’s Cu–Ni–Au deposits ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=China%20is%20one%20of%20the,and%20nickel%20ores%2C%20and%20are))) helps define prospects. Faults, veins and alteration zones that emit bismuth-telluride anomalies are also mapped.  
• **Mineral indicator methods:** Identification of trace Se minerals (clausthalite – PbSe, naumannite – Ag₂Se, tiemannite – HgSe, etc.) using microscopy or XRD in drill core can indicate areas for further work ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20selenide%20deposits%20in%20the,PbSe%29%2C%20naumannite)). Modern field portable XRF or laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can help detect elevated Se in logging.  
• **Collar-to-outcrop correlation:** Comparing drill assays to surface geochemistry (e.g. using IP-derived resistivity lows or soil XRF) for vectors to Se enrichment.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Soda-ash roasting:** Copper anode slimes (5–25% Se) are mixed with Na₂CO₃ and roasted (≈530–650 °C) to convert selenium into soluble sodium selenate ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Soda%20Ash%20Roasting,the%20use%20of%20concentrated%20hydrochloric)). The roast product is leached, yielding Na₂SeO₄ in solution. Subsequent reduction (e.g. with heat or catalysts) converts it to Na₂Se, which upon oxidation or air sparging precipitates elemental Se ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Soda%20Ash%20Roasting,the%20use%20of%20concentrated%20hydrochloric)).  
• **Acid (sulfatizing) roasting:** Slimes are mixed with H₂SO₄ and roasted at 500–600 °C to form SeO₂, which volatilizes. ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Sulfuric%20Acid%20Roasting,%28Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=Sulphatizing%20roast)) The SeO₂ vapor is captured (scrubbed) in water to form selenous acid (H₂SeO₃). This solution is acidified and then reduced (e.g. by sparging SO₂) to yield red elemental selenium ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20selenium,In%20South%20Africa%2C%20Se%20is)). This route (H₂SO₄ roast + SO₂ reduction) is widely used (e.g. China, Europe). The resulting Se is ~99.5–99.7% pure ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Sulfuric%20Acid%20Roasting,%28Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)).  
• **Direct leach & precipitation:** Some processes skip calcine. For example, dissolved copper refinery slimes in H₂SO₄ yield a liquor of heavy metals. Controlled oxidation (air/SO₂) is used to first settle copper, then selenium. In South Africa’s process, H₂SeO₃ solution is sparged with SO₂, precipitating fine Se ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20selenium,In%20South%20Africa%2C%20Se%20is)). Alternatively, addition of HCl or ferrous salts directly to leachates reduces Se(VI/IV) to elemental Se ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=sodium%20selenide%2C%20which%20is%20leached,chloride%20ions%20as%20the%20reductant)).  
• **Electrolytic recovery:** In copper electrowinning, residual Se and Te are left in solution and on cathodes. Electrolytically recovering copper while holding Se out (and later stripping Se) is an important part of the flow. Some limited electrorefining (using mercury or lead anodes) has been studied, but is not common in allied Se production.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Leach-scrub separation:** After roasting, SeO₂ is dissolved in dilute H₂SO₄. The aqueous selenous acid is then chemically separated by reduction to elemental Se ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20selenium,In%20South%20Africa%2C%20Se%20is)), effectively separating selenium from insoluble residues. In practice, this step removes ~99% of Se from the copper circuit. For example, during electrowinning, copper sulfate liquor treated with SO₂ leaves Se at ~1 mg/L, separating it from Cu ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20selenium%20dioxide%20is%20then,Different%20approaches%20to%20treating%20anode)).  
• **Selective precipitation:** Iron(II) or sulfide can be used to precipitate selenium from solution. Adding ferrous salts (Fe²⁺) to a selenate solution induces formation of elemental Se (or ferrous selenite) that can be filtered. Colloidal Se is then washed and collected. This separates Se from soluble copper/arsenic.  
• **Ion exchange/material separation:** After initial recovery, residual selenite/selenate in effluent can be captured on adsorbents (activated alumina, iron hydroxide, layered double hydroxides) to polish the solution. Such materials preferentially bind Se oxyanions, separating them from bulk waste water. In Veolia’s Tracer™ system, after biological reduction (to selenite/S0), ferric oxyhydroxide media adsorb Se ([www.veoliawatertech.com](https://www.veoliawatertech.com/en/publications/articles/selenium-removal-from-industrial-wastewater#:~:text=Selenium%20is%20by%20now%20a,The%20mechanisms)).  
• **Membrane/solvent extraction (research):** Laboratory methods include solvent extraction (using lipophilic amines) of Se from acidic media, or membrane diffusion cells for H₂SeO₃, though these are not widely used at scale in mining contexts.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Vacuum distillation:** Selenium has a significant vapor pressure at ~685 °C. Under vacuum, Se is distilled away from higher-boiling impurities (e.g. Te, Pb, Bi). This yields 4N–6N (“99.99–99.999%”) Se. (Refs. [90†L1-L4]). T. Burger *et al.* note vacuum distillation as a principal method for refining Se ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/4/739#:~:text=methods%20are%20vacuum%20distillation%20and,7%2C8%2C9)).  
• **Fractional crystallization / zone refining:** Controlled solidification can incrementally purify Se. Melt Se and slowly cool (often in a rotating or multi-zone crystallizer) so that impurities concentrate at one end. Recent work (He *et al.*, 2023) shows a cooled rotating crystallizer raising purity from 99.9% to 99.997% in three passes ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/4/739#:~:text=and%20discussed,The)). Traditional zone-melting (repeated moving-melt-zones through a rod of Se) likewise segregates impurities. These methods remove residual Pb, Fe, Hg, etc., to achieve electronics-grade Se.  
• **Chemical redissolution/electrorefining:** Crude Se can be dissolved in acid and subjected to electrorefining (anode-cathode) similar to copper, depositing pure Se and leaving impurities. This is less common industrially, but has been demonstrated.  
• **Filtration & chemical polishing:** Fine filtration can remove insoluble Se particles after each reduction step. Wash solutions with chelators or selective precipitating agents to remove minor impurities (e.g. Ag, Cu traces) as salts, ensuring final Se is >99.5% ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Sulfuric%20Acid%20Roasting,%28Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Biological reduction (bioreactors):** Engineered bioreactors cultivating selenate-reducing bacteria (e.g. *Thauera selenatis*, sulfate-reducing consortia) convert dissolved Se(VI) and Se(IV) to insoluble elemental Se or volatile methylated Se. Fluidized-bed bioreactors have shown ~100% Se removal efficiency ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9941446/#:~:text=Results%3A)). These systems are effective for treating mine drainage or industrial effluent (e.g. BASF used bioreactors to remove Se from wastewater).  
• **Constructed wetlands / phytoremediation:** Shallow wetlands planted with Se-accumulating species (e.g. *Brassica* spp.) and inoculated with beneficial microbes can sequester and methylate selenium. Studies report >90% removal of Se from irrigation/drainage water via plant uptake and microbial volatilization ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es970502l#:~:text=,Drew)) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9941446/#:~:text=Results%3A)).  
• **Adsorption and chemical precipitation:** Passive or active treatments use adsorbents (activated alumina, iron/zirconium oxyhydroxides) to bind selenite/selenate. Veolia’s novel “Tracer™ Se” process, for example, uses microbial reduction to SeO₃, then filters it onto ferric oxyhydroxide ([www.veoliawatertech.com](https://www.veoliawatertech.com/en/publications/articles/selenium-removal-from-industrial-wastewater#:~:text=Selenium%20is%20by%20now%20a,The%20mechanisms)). Alternatively, adding FeSO₄ or Na₂S to water coprecipitates Se as elemental Se or metal selenides. Ion-exchange resins (e.g. Purolite A-400Se) can also capture SeO₄²⁻ from dilute streams.  
• **Advanced oxidation / photocatalysis:** In some proposals, UV or photocatalysts (TiO₂, ZnO) degrade Se compounds or facilitate reduction under illumination. These methods are largely experimental but have been reviewed as emerging approaches in water treatment (as noted in recent reviews) ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9941446/#:~:text=Results%3A)).  
• **Combined chemo-bio systems:** Emerging designs combine chemical and biological stages for robustness. For instance, Veolia’s Tracer™ cyclically reduces Se with bacteria, adsorbs it, then re-oxidizes the effluent ([www.veoliawatertech.com](https://www.veoliawatertech.com/en/publications/articles/selenium-removal-from-industrial-wastewater#:~:text=Selenium%20is%20by%20now%20a,The%20mechanisms)). The cited literature emphasizes that hybrid systems (biological + adsorption) can approach complete Se removal ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9941446/#:~:text=Results%3A)) ([www.veoliawatertech.com](https://www.veoliawatertech.com/en/publications/articles/selenium-removal-from-industrial-wastewater#:~:text=Selenium%20is%20by%20now%20a,The%20mechanisms)).

## References for mining technologies  
Key references include USGS and scientific literature on Se processing. Hoffmann and King (1997) detail soda-ash vs sulfation roasting ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Soda%20Ash%20Roasting,the%20use%20of%20concentrated%20hydrochloric)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=Sulfuric%20Acid%20Roasting,%28Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)).

Recent metallurgical studies demonstrate modern purification: e.g. vacuum distillation and crystalization methods ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/4/739#:~:text=methods%20are%20vacuum%20distillation%20and,7%2C8%2C9)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/13/4/739#:~:text=and%20discussed,The)). Remediation reviews (Fadaei *et al.*, 2023) summarize bioremediation and adsorption techniques ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9941446/#:~:text=Results%3A)). Veolia’s water-treatment article describes an industrial bio-adsorption process ([www.veoliawatertech.com](https://www.veoliawatertech.com/en/publications/articles/selenium-removal-from-industrial-wastewater#:~:text=Selenium%20is%20by%20now%20a,The%20mechanisms)). These sources, among others, underpin the technologies discussed above.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• The principal bottleneck is **securing selenium-rich feedstock and processing it at scale**. Industrial production relies almost entirely on copper refining byproducts ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20selenium,the%20solution%20is%20acidified%20to)). In the US and allies, there is no primary Se mining, so Se supply hinges on composite copper slimes. However, domestic Cu electrowinning capacity is limited (U.S. refiners have closed ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=The%20U,Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997))), and existing allied smelters lack dedicated Se recovery expansion. Thus the key missing technology is a reliable, large-scale recovery process (e.g. improved roasting or bio-extraction) integrated into copper refining. Without revitalizing electrolytic copper refining or developing novel recovery (e.g. microbial leaching of old mine tailings), allied selenium output cannot grow. In short, the technological choke-point is **efficient extraction of Se from byproducts** – existing methods (high-temperature roasting, wet chemistry) are proven but require investment and infrastructure that the U.S. and many allies currently lack ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=The%20U,Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)) ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20selenium,the%20solution%20is%20acidified%20to)).  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In summary, Selenium in the US and allied nations is only obtainable as a copper-industry byproduct, and the technology to capture it at scale is lacking domestically. With U.S. electrolytic refiners gone ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=The%20U,Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)), and new copper-smelting or bioleaching projects slow to materialize, the major bottleneck is having an available high-Se feed (anode sludge) plus the processing plants to convert it. In effect, **recovering selenium from copper slimes (via roasting or bioreduction) is the critical missing link** ([www.scielo.org.za](https://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?pid=S2225-62532016000600018&script=sci_arttext#:~:text=The%20largest%20source%20of%20selenium,the%20solution%20is%20acidified%20to)) ([www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600360/#:~:text=The%20U,Hoffmann%20and%20King%201997)). Absent this, allied supply remains stuck below demand.
