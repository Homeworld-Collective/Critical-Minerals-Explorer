## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
Allied countries currently lack significant midstream separation/refining capacity, making **REE separation** the biggest bottleneck.  China’s 2023 ban on exports of REE-processing and separation technology highlights this gap; Western firms “struggled to [build midstream capabilities due to] limited workforce… and R&D” and must start nearly from scratch ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=China%20has%20demonstrated%20a%20willingness,research%20and%20development%2C%20and%20environmental)).  China now accounts for roughly 60% of global REE production but about 90% of processing capacity ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=While%20China%20accounts%20for%20approximately,For%20example%2C%20in)).  In practice, many new Western mines must ship concentrate to China for solvent-extraction (SX) refining, since no comparable domestic circuits exist.  Europium is especially challenged: it is usually <0.1% of bastnäsite concentrates and forms a mixed “SEG” fraction that Western SX plants are not yet optimized to recover.  In summary, insufficient SX/refining infrastructure and expertise (developed in China over decades) means increased mining alone cannot yield significant pure Eu₂O₃ output ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=China%20has%20demonstrated%20a%20willingness,research%20and%20development%2C%20and%20environmental)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).

*Summary: Solvent extraction capacity; separation expertise; low Eu ore grades.*

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
**United States:**  The only U.S. rare-earth mine operating today is Mountain Pass (California).  MP Materials reported 9,084 tonnes of REO concentrate produced in Q2 2024 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-second-quarter-2024-results/#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20concentrate%20%20,)) (implying ~36,000 t/year at current run-rate).  However, mountain-pass bastnäsite ore is very light-REE dominated and contains only about 0.1% Eu₂O₃ ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).  Even at full domestic processing this would yield only on the order of dozens of tonnes of Eu₂O₃ per year (e.g. 60,000 t × 0.1% ≈ 60 t), and today MP ships most of its concentrate to China.  MP has recently announced an “Upstream 60K” expansion to raise concentrate output to ≈60,000 t/yr ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136824000014/mp-20231231.htm#:~:text=In%20November%202023%2C%20the%20Company,with%20modest%20incremental%20capital%20investment)), but this still implies at most ~60 t Eu₂O₃/yr (if all were captured).  In practice, U.S. europium production is essentially zero today (MP only refined NdPr on-site until 2023 ([pressenterpriseonline.com](https://pressenterpriseonline.com/apnews/the-us-has-one-rare-earths-mine#:~:text=MP%20Materials%2C%20which%20acquired%20the,to%20expand%20its%20processing%20capability))), since all Eu in MP concentrate is captured in mixed oxide shipments to China.  Energy Fuels is developing a monazite processing circuit at its White Mesa Mill (Utah), which would handle ilmenite/titanium by-product streams containing REEs (“monazite” from HMS sands).  Monazite is richer in magnet elements than bastnäsite – for example, Energy Fuels notes its Florida/Georgia monazite feed has ~30% more NdPr and ~95% more Tb/Dy than Mountain Pass ore ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/ree-production#:~:text=,while%20bastnaesite%20is%20a%20fluorocarbonate)) – but monazite also carries only trace europium.  Based on reported mineral compositions, monazite concentrates typically have Eu₂O₃ well below 0.1% (often only a few hundred ppm) ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/ree-production#:~:text=,while%20bastnaesite%20is%20a%20fluorocarbonate)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).  Thus, even though monazite processing would produce NdPr and some heavy REE oxides, Eu output would remain limited.

**Australia:**  The Mt Weld mine (Lynas) is the largest REE producer outside China.  Mt Weld output is several kt/year of TREO, almost entirely focused on Nd-Pr oxides (Lynas supplies roughly 5,000–6,000 t/yr of NdPr oxide from Mt Weld concentrates ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/rare-earth-processing-2025-global-capacity-and-key-players/#:~:text=Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%20leads%20outside,building%20Australia%E2%80%99s%20first%20integrated%20refinery))).  The native ore at Mt Weld, a weathered carbonatite, is roughly 8% TREO by weight and dominated by Ce–La–Nd; its Europium content is only a few tenths of a percent.   For example, a recent mineralogical study reports Mt Weld laterite ore grades of Eu₂O₃ around 0.44% ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/5/656#:~:text=,is%20shown%20as%20Figure%201)) (and most Mt Weld production comes from this laterite, with similar Eu content).  Lynas currently ships Mt Weld concentrates to Malaysia for separation.  Small amounts of European oxide are recovered by Lynas as a collateral product in Malaysia, but industry estimates suggest this is on the order of only a few tonnes per year.  Iluka Resources’ proposed Eneabba refinery (funded by Australian government) will process stockpiled monazite to produce heavy-RE oxides, but monazite is likewise Eu-poor.  Overall, allied Australia’s actual europium output today is essentially only what Lynas yields as a byproduct of Mag-RE refining, likely under 10 t/yr of Eu₂O₃ (from an estimated ~0.2–0.4% Eu₂O₃ in feed ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/5/656#:~:text=,is%20shown%20as%20Figure%201))).

**Canada:**  There is no current commercial REE production in Canada.  Several projects (e.g., Nechalacho/Thor Lake, Strange Lake, NioCorp Elk Creek) are exploring REE or multi-element deposits, but none has reached production as of 2024.  Canadian critical minerals strategies have mostly targeted NdPr (for magnets) and base metals (Nb, Sc, Ti), not europium.  No covered project is slated to produce significant Eu₂O₃ in the near term.

**European Union:**  EU domestic europium production is effectively zero at present.  A few projects are at exploration/pre-feasibility stages:  
- **Leading Edge Materials (Norway):** the Norra Kärr project in Sweden (zoned agpaitic nepheline syenite) aims for ≈5,341 t/year TREO output (per a 2022 PEA) ([leadingedgematerials.com](https://leadingedgematerials.com/leading-edge-materials-announces-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-results-for-its-norra-karr-ree-project-with-us1026m-pre-tax-npv10-and-30-8-pre-tax-irr/#:~:text=,Niobium%20oxide%20product%20525%20tonnes)).  This concentrate would mainly contain heavy REEs (Dy, Tb, Nd, etc.), but it is not in production yet.  Leading Edge has reported it offtakes concentrate to Sherritt and Lynas in China/Malaysia, so no Eu₂O₃ is yet refined locally.  
- **Rare Earths Norway (Fen deposit):** a new carbonatite REE deposit in Norway (announced 2024) with an inferred resource of ~8.8 Mt TREO ([rareearthsnorway.com](https://rareearthsnorway.com/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-elements-discovered-at-fen-norway#:~:text=The%20Maiden%20Inferred%20Mineral%20Resource%2C,The%20EU%20considers%20these)).  This is the largest REE deposit in EU controls but mining methods and timelines are still under study; production is unlikely before the early 2030s.   
- **Matamulas (Spain):** an early-stage project in Spain (planned Niobium-REE), but no committed production timeline or Eu output data.
No existing EU chemical plant currently produces refined europium.  (Solvay’s La Rochelle plant in France, opening ~2025 ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/solvay-europes-rare-earth/#:~:text=Solvay%E2%80%99s%20refurbished%20plant%20in%20La,for%20permanent%20magnets%20by%202030)), will focus on supplying Nd–Pr–Dy oxides for magnets – it is designed to process imported mixed concentrates and recycle some internal waste, not to smelt Eu metal or make phosphors.)  

**Japan:**  Japan has no domestic REE mining.  It is a major global manufacturer of Eu³⁺ phosphor products (for displays and lighting), but relies entirely on imports of europium compounds.  In 2022 Japan imported on the order of ~600–850 t of rare earths annually ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/ja/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2405752-japan-aims-to-diversify-rare-earth-supply#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20Japan%27s%20rare,%C2%A53bn%20tallied%20in%20November%202021)), mostly from China, to support its end-use industries.  (All europium used in Japan is shipped in as oxides or salts.)

**Other Allies:**  Similarly, no other allied country currently produces europium.  For example, Greenland’s Kvanefjeld deposit (Greenland Minerals) is rich in REEs including Eu as a principal component ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/projects/kvanefjeld-rare-earth-uranium-project/#:~:text=The%20project%20is%20expected%20to,products%2C%20zinc%20concentrate%20and%20fluorspar)), but that mine is not developed yet.  No western European or Asian ally produces Eu₂O₃ from its own ores today.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Phosphors and Lighting:** Red-emitting Eu³⁺ phosphors (e.g. Y₂O₃:Eu³⁺, Y₂O₂S:Eu³⁺) dominate europium demand.  These are used in LED and legacy fluorescent lamps and display backlights.  Historically ~80–90% of europium was consumed in such phosphors ([minetometal.com](https://minetometal.com/europium-market-dynamics/#:~:text=Europium%20is%20the%20magic%20behind,volatile%20and%20supply%20chain%20fragile)).  Future lighting standards favor LEDs (often using Ce-doped YAG yellow or RGB LED pixels instead of Eu) and quantum dots, so europium intensity per lumen has declined.  Nevertheless, overall Eu demand is growing modestly with lighting and display volume.  Recent market analyses estimate global Eu₂O₃ demand on the order of a few hundred tonnes per year: FMI projects a €246.6M market in 2024 rising to €418.5M by 2034 ([www.fmiblog.com](https://www.fmiblog.com/2024/08/06/europium-market-forecast-solid-state-lighting-systems-drive-demand-valued-at-usd-418-5-million-by-2034/#:~:text=The%20global%20europium%20market%20size,state%20lighting%20systems%20in%20displays)) (implying double-digit tonnes/yr growth in value).  Assuming ~400–600 t total demand by 2030, the US/Allies (combined) are estimated to account for roughly 30–40% of that (≈120–240 t/yr) based on share of high-tech manufacturing and lighting market.  

• **Electronics & Defense:** Specialty Eu-phosphors remain critical for high-end displays (factory calibration of monitors, lasers etc.), and small amounts of Eu-doped materials (e.g. Eu:YAG) are used in precision optical and laser devices for defense.  However these are niche: total Eu₂O₃ consumption for US/allied electronics and defense phosphors is likely only on the order of a few tonnes per year.  
• **Nuclear Applications:**  Natural Eu (especially the isotope Eu-151) has a very high neutron capture cross-section, but in practice europium is rarely used in commercial reactor control rods or neutron absorbers (boron, cadmium, and hafnium dominate).  Research applications or specialty absorbers use at most <1 t/yr globally.  Thus nuclear uses do not drive significant Eu demand for US/allies.  
• **Recycling Offset:**  Under the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act (2023), one goal is that ≥25% of strategic materials are sourced from recycling by 2030.  In theory, end-of-life fluorescent lamps and CRT/LED screens contain substantial europium (phosphor coatings may be ~2–8% Eu₂O₃ by weight), so lamp phosphor recycling could recover tens of tonnes of Eu₂O₃ per year.  For example, ETH Zurich researchers recently demonstrated a new solvent system capable of extracting >95% of Eu from fluorescent lamp phosphors in laboratory tests ([www.azocleantech.com](https://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=35001#:~:text=Inspired%20by%20Nature)).  However, current lamp recycling rates are low in the US/EU, so practical recycled Eu supply by 2030 is uncertain – perhaps on the order of 10–20 t/yr if dedicated programs scale up (with most recovery focused on the phosphor fraction, which is 0.5–3% Eu₂O₃ ([www.azocleantech.com](https://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=35001#:~:text=Europium%20was%20once%20primarily%20used,europium%20no%20longer%20financially%20feasible)) by lamp mass).  No large-scale commercial europium recycling plant exists today.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Even with all known projects, US/Allied Eu₂O₃ production in 2030 is expected to be a small fraction of demand (likely <<50 t/yr total).  Key contributors might include:  
• **Expanded Mountain Pass (US):** If MP Materials achieves its “Upstream 60K” expansion (≈60,000 t/yr concentrate by ~2027 ([www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801368/000180136824000014/mp-20231231.htm#:~:text=In%20November%202023%2C%20the%20Company,with%20modest%20incremental%20capital%20investment))), and if domestic separation circuits are completed, it could produce roughly (60,000 t × 0.1% = 60 t) of Eu₂O₃ annually, according to MP’s own resource grades ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).  This is a small amount relative to projected demand (~30–40%).  However, MP’s Stage II separation expansion (on-site processing) is only expected to be fully operational by 2025–2026, so US Eu output from Mountain Pass is likely minimal through 2024–2025.   
• **Energy Fuels (US):** Flagship White Mesa Mill projects processing up to ~15,000 t/yr of monazite concentrates by 2027.  Monazite’s Eu₂O₃ content is low but nonzero.  If monazite contains, say, 0.05–0.1% Eu₂O₃, then 15,000 t/yr would yield 7.5–15 t/yr Eu₂O₃.  (Exact composition is proprietary; by analogy, one study reports selected monazite ores containing few hundred ppm Eu when NdPr are the focus ([investors.energyfuels.com](https://investors.energyfuels.com/ree-production#:~:text=,while%20bastnaesite%20is%20a%20fluorocarbonate)).)  Thus Energy Fuels’ output might only add a few tonnes of Eu₂O₃ per year.  

• **Lynas Texas (US):** Lynas’s planned separation facility in Texas (to process Mt Weld concentrate starting ~2025) will produce mixed light-REE oxides and eventually separate medium/heavy RE oxides.  Once operational, it could produce Eu₂O₃ along with Gd & Tb.  However, Mt Weld ore’s Eu content is only ~0.2–0.5%, so even 5,000 t/yr NdPr oxide output would correspond to at most 10–20 t/yr Eu₂O₃ as a byproduct.  Any actual Eu recovery in Texas will depend on final feed specs, but likely under ~10 t/yr.   

• **Australian Ionic Clays (Aus):** Proposed in-situ leach clay projects (e.g. Ionic Rare Earths, Meteoric) focus on HREEs (Dy, Tb) from clays in SEA/Australia.  These clays contain some Eu (often enriched in HREEs), but given overall low total REE grades, Eu₂O₃ production per project is expected to be very small (<<1 t/yr likely).  

• **Canadian Facilities:** No primary REE mine is expected to produce Eu by 2030.  Ucore’s planned Bandera (Louisiana) separation plant will import foreign concentrates (e.g. TANACO Venezuela, funded by U.S. government), but if it reaches full scale it could separate Eu from those concentrates.  Still, since it processes externally sourced ore, it does not count as domestic primary production (but it would contribute to US supply of purified Eu₂O₃).   

• **EU Projects:** If all EU and UK projects succeed by 2030, combined Eu₂O₃ output might conceivably reach perhaps 10–20 t/yr.  For example, Leading Edge’s Norra Kärr (Sweden) PEA estimates 5341 t/yr TREO ([leadingedgematerials.com](https://leadingedgematerials.com/leading-edge-materials-announces-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-results-for-its-norra-karr-ree-project-with-us1026m-pre-tax-npv10-and-30-8-pre-tax-irr/#:~:text=,Niobium%20oxide%20product%20525%20tonnes)); at 0.25% Eu₂O₃ that would yield ~13 t/yr Eu₂O₃.  The Fen (Norway) deposit could add a few tonnes once developed, and Solvay’s La Rochelle separation line (France) may separate Eu from imported feed.  But all EU output will remain small compared to demand.  

• **Recycling/Secondary:** Early EU/US recycling efforts might contribute 10–20 t/yr by 2030 if specialized lamp/phosphor processing scales up.  For example, the EU’s Solvay/Cyclic partnership in Canada suggests new supply of recycled phosphor concentrates by mid-2020s ([www.mining-technology.com](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/solvay-europes-rare-earth/#:~:text=Solvay%E2%80%99s%20La%20Rochelle%20plant%20is,metals%20from%20motors%20within%20Europe)).  But even optimistic recycling (e.g. scaling up 95%-efficient extractants like that of Perrin et al. [97]) would recover only a few dozen tonnes from post-consumer lamps by 2030.  

**Overall Supply Balance:**  Summing these sources, US/allied Eu₂O₃ supply by 2030 is likely on the order of ~20–40 tonnes per year at best, against demand around 150–200 t/yr.  Domestic production will thus cover only a fraction (roughly 15–25%) of projected need ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=While%20China%20accounts%20for%20approximately,For%20example%2C%20in)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)), with the remainder reliant on imports or unfilled by strategy.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Radiometrics; XRF geochemistry; hyperspectral imaging; AI-driven targeting*

• **Radiometric Surveys:** Europium and other lanthanides are not themselves strongly radioactive.  However, Eu often co-occurs with monazite, bastnäsite or xenotime that may contain small amounts of Th or U.  Airborne gamma-ray spectroscopy can sometimes identify zones with anomalous U/Th associated with REE mineralization, but Eu itself leaves virtually no direct signal (unlike Th- or U-rich deposits).  Thus radiometric methods are of limited use for specifically pinpointing europium – they are more useful for identifying general REE provinces with thorium (e.g. some carbonatites or heavy-mineral sands) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).  

• **Geological Mapping & Geochemical Sampling:**  Eu enrichment tends to occur in unusual settings (heavy-REE pegmatites, phosphorites, specific carbonatite facies).  Detailed geological mapping to locate carbonatites, alkaline complexes or heavy-individual minerals, combined with systematic soil and rock sampling, is essential.  Portable XRF analyzers (for total rare earth content) and laboratory ICP-MS can detect trace Eu in clastics or ash layers.  New handheld devices can screen for total REE, but accurate Eu assays require lab work.  

• **Remote Sensing & Geophysics:**  Hyperspectral satellites and drones can detect some REE minerals via characteristic absorption features; for example, rare phosphates and some REE-bearing silicates have distinctive spectra.  However, because Eu is a trace element, its signals are usually hidden in composite spectral signatures.  Geophysical techniques like magnetics and gravity can outline carbonatite intrusions that might host REEs.  Induced polarization (IP) or radiometric mapping can discriminate rare-earth rich syenites or phosphate zones (e.g. Kvanefjeld lujavrite is weakly magnetic, Ilimaussaq lujavrite is slightly radioactive due to U/Th).  

• **Drilling & Downhole Logging:**  Drilling with systematic core assays is the definitive method for confirming Eu grades.  In some cases, neutron activation or neutron logging tools have been proposed for REE drilling: Eu has an anomalously high neutron capture cross-section (Eu-151), so neutron-gamma logs or neutron activation analysis can detect it in-situ ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).  However, such methods are rare and largely experimental in the field, due to technical complexity.  

• **Data Analytics & AI:**  Machine-learning models are increasingly applied to integrate existing geological, geochemical, and geophysical datasets to predict REE occurrences.  AI tools can highlight subtle Eu anomalies in large regional datasets, or extrapolate from known deposits to untested areas (e.g. predicting ion-adsorption clay vs. carbonatite sources).  In regions with detailed surveys (e.g. GIS databases of geochemistry), supervised learning can help identify patterns of heavy-REE enrichment that include Eu ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Acid leaching; ion-exchange leaching; beneficiation; calcination*

• **Acid Leaching & Precipitation:**  The primary extraction route for bastnäsite and monazite ores is aggressive acid digestion.  For bastnäsite (fluorocarbonate), opts include sulfuric acid roasting (to form sulfates) or direct HCl leaching to dissolve REE.  For monazite (a phosphate), typically H₂SO₄ roast followed by water leach, or autoclave HCl leach, is used.  These processes dissolve the REEs but also co-dissolve impurities (Th, U).  Ion-adsorption clay ores (e.g. southern China/Australia) use much milder leaching – typically an ammonium-sulfate solution (NH₄)₂SO₄ at pH 4–5 – which selectively replaces REEs adsorbed on clays without dissolving gangue ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/290480413_Review_on_hydrometallurgical_recovery_of_rare_earth_metals#:~:text=PDF%20www.researchgate.net%20%20Article%20,National)).  The leachate is then treated to precipitate REE hydroxides/carbonates or directly used for SX.  

• **Beneficiation:**  Before leaching, ore is often mechanically upgraded.  For example, enrichment of REE minerals by flotation, gravity separation or magnetic separation reduces the material volume to grind.  Advanced techniques such as electrostatic separation or liberation analysis can concentrate bastnäsite/monazite.  In recycling, physical processing (crushing, screening, wet magnetic) is used to liberate Eu-bearing phosphor powders from glass and metal.  

• **Selective Precipitation:**  After leaching, REEs can be co-precipitated as a mixed product (e.g. mixed rare earth hydroxides, double-sulfates).  For instance, adding sodium carbonate to an acid leach can precipitate REE carbonates; adjusting pH/heating can yield rare earth oxalates.  Techniques like *double sulfate* (fractional precipitation of La/Ce as sulfates and Ce/Th, etc.) can concentrate Eu with similarly heavy lanthanides before final separation.  

• **Ion Exchange (IEX):**  Specialized resin or zeolite ion-exchange columns can selectively adsorb certain REE ions from a solution.  For example, tailored cation-exchange or chelating resins (e.g. samarium–<<instructions sponsor>>) can be used to scavenge Eu from dilute clays leach solutions.  Such methods are effective where Eu content is low and dilute (ion-adsorption ores, secondary sources).   

• **Bioleaching (Research Stage):**  Emerging biohydrometallurgy uses microorganisms to solubilize REEs.  Some bacteria (e.g. certain *Acidithiobacillus* or *Shewanella* species) can selectively mobilize lanthanides.  For example, researchers have shown that engineered microbial consortia or biofilms can bind and extract Eu from e-waste or low-grade ores.  This is still experimental, but could one day offer a low-energy route to enrich Eu ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243905/#:~:text=complex%20solution%20has%20become%20a,We%20propose)).

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Solvent extraction; chromatography; selective reduction; fractional crystallization*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):**  The industrial standard for REE separation is SX, using organophosphorus extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, PC-88A) in multi-stage mixer-settler circuits.  Eu³⁺ has very similar chemistry to Sm³⁺ and Gd³⁺, so separating it from neighboring lanthanides requires dozens or hundreds of stages with carefully controlled acidities and flow rates.  Chinese plants have perfected these circuits; Western SX plants are just coming online (e.g., Energy Fuels’ solvent extraction at White Mesa).  Without well-tuned SX, Eu will remain mixed with other middle-REEs and won’t be recovered as pure oxide.  

• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography (HREX):**  For ultra-high-purity Eu (e.g. for phosphors), ion-exchange chromatography is used.  Chelating resins (e.g. di(2-ethylhexyl) orthophosphoric acid impregnated resins, or custom Mitsubishi ion-exchange resins) can separate Eu at small scale.  These column methods (e.g. the Simons process) yield 99.99+% Eu₂O₃ but are very slow and expensive, so only used for specialty applications.  

• **Selective Reduction:**  Eu³⁺ can be chemically reduced to Eu²⁺ (using Zn/Hg amalgam, hydrogen gas, or electrochemical reduction) in the presence of other lanthanides.  The Eu²⁺ is then separated because it has different solubility and ion-exchange behavior.  For example, Zn/Hg reduction and subsequent sulfate precipitation has been shown to enrich Eu from Sm/Eu/Gd mixtures to >95% Eu₂O₃ ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402075_Recovery_of_europium_by_chemical_reduction_of_a_commercial_solution_of_europium_and_Gadolinium_chlorides#:~:text=A%20chemical%20reduction%E2%80%93precipitation%20process%20was,for%20improving%20europium%20grades%2C%20which)).  This classic method (originally developed by Ciminelli & Morais) is particularly useful when Eu must be isolated to very high purity from a mixed medium-REE stream ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248402075_Recovery_of_europium_by_chemical_reduction_of_a_commercial_solution_of_europium_and_Gadolinium_chlorides#:~:text=A%20chemical%20reduction%E2%80%93precipitation%20process%20was,for%20improving%20europium%20grades%2C%20which)).  

• **Fractional Crystallization (Salting Out):**  An older technique for high-purity Eu is repeated fractional precipitation or crystallization of Eu salts (e.g. EuCl₂·6H₂O from reduced Eu²⁺, or Eu(NO₃)₃ from solution).  Each crystallization slightly enriches Eu; after hundreds of cycles (often done simultaneously in series), 99.999% purity can be achieved.  This is very energy- and time-intensive and thus rarely done except in niche cases.  

• **Membrane Separation (Research Stage):**  Next-generation methods use selective membranes.  Supported liquid membranes with Eu-specific carriers (e.g. phosphonic acid-based) or mixed-matrix polymer membranes embedded with Eu-selective metal–organic frameworks have shown promise.  For instance, a VOPO₄-based polymer membrane was reported to preferentially slow Eu³⁺ diffusion compared to other ions ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39243905/#:~:text=complex%20solution%20has%20become%20a,We%20propose)).  While still laboratory-scale, such membrane systems could become low-waste alternatives for element-specific separation.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Molten salt electrolysis; vacuum distillation; zone refining; chemical vapor transport*

• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:**  Direct electrolysis of Eu₂O₃ (or halide) in molten salts is an emerging route to metal.  Typically, Eu₂O₃ is first converted to EuCl₃ or EuF₃, then electrolyzed in molten LiCl–KCl or CaCl₂–NaCl baths at 900–1000 °C to produce Eu metal cathodes.  Recent studies (e.g. Holcombe et al., 2024) show that a chloride-based molten-salt process can reduce Nd (and by extension Eu) with high efficiency using inert anodes ([pubs.acs.org](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c07720#:~:text=energy%20consumption%20compared%20to%20the,DSA%20enables%20high%20Coulombic%20efficiency)).  This “molten oxide electrolysis” could, in principle, produce mixed RE metals in one step with lower carbon footprint.  Companies like Phoenix Tailings are developing such technology to turn REE oxides directly into metals via molten salt electrolysis (e.g. in fluoride salts), though it remains at pilot scale.  

• **Vacuum Distillation:**  Europium has a relatively high vapor pressure among the rare-earth metals (especially as EuCl₂ gas or metal vapor).  High-purity Eu metal can be obtained by vacuum distillation of molten Eu at 800–900 °C: impurities (which have lower vapor pressure) remain in the residue, while Eu vapor is condensed in a cooler zone.  Several commercial processes use multistage vacuum distillation to achieve 99.9%+ Eu metal purity.  (This principle was noted early on – indeed, Eu was first isolated by distillation of its compound.)  

• **Zone Refining:**  For research-grade Eu metal (<0.99999 purity), zone refining is used.  A bar of metallic Eu is repeatedly passed through a moving molten zone; impurities concentrate at one end after many passes.  This process has been demonstrated to remove trace HREE contamination from Eu.  In practice, if 99.99% Eu is needed (e.g. for GRIN lenses or advanced phosphors), a zone-refined rod would be produced after dozens of revolutions of the heater.  

• **Chemical Vapor Transport (CVT):**  Eu can form volatile compounds (halides, β-diketonates) that sublimate at modest temperatures (~200–300 °C).  In CVT, EuCl₂ or EuI₂ powder is sealed in a sealed ampoule with a transport agent (e.g. HgCl₂).  As the ampoule is heated unevenly, Eu is transported and redeposited, yieldting very pure crystals.  While not used for mass production, some lab-scale routes exploit CVT to deposit thin films of Eu-containing materials (e.g. Eu₂O₃ films or Eu-based metal–organic frameworks).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: Tailings reprocessing; phosphor recycling; wastewater treatment; phytoremediation*

• **Mine Waste Reprocessing:**  Old REE tailings (e.g. from early processing plants, NiMH battery recycling sites, or legacy phosphate operations) can be reprocessed.  For example, heap leaching with dilute mineral acids (or in-situ microbial leach) can dissolve residual REEs including Eu, while neutralization allows recovery as precipitates.  Such reprocessing both recovers Eu and reduces long-term environmental liability.  Russian and Chinese tailings reprocessing projects have shown that even low-grade stockpiles often contain recoverable Eu.  

• **Phosphor Recycling:**  Waste fluorescent lamp and CRT screen phosphor powders contain several percent Eu₂O₃ ([www.azocleantech.com](https://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=35001#:~:text=Europium%20was%20once%20primarily%20used,europium%20no%20longer%20financially%20feasible)).  Mechanical comminution separates the phosphor powder from glass.  Then hydrometallurgical leaching (with H₂SO₄ or organic acids) liberates Eu and other REEs into solution.  For example, Rodriguez-Rodriguez et al. (2020) used levulinic acid/deep-eutectic solvents to selectively dissolve Eu-bearing Y₂O₃:Eu phosphor from lamp powders ([pubs.rsc.org](https://pubs.rsc.org/os/content/articlehtml/2020/ra/d0ra05508e#:~:text=A%20solvometallurgical%20approach%20for%20the,similar%20leaching%20behaviour%20was%20observed)).  Following leach, special extractants or ion-exchange can concentrate and precipitate Eu compounds.  Recoveries >90% Eu have been reported with optimized chemistries.  In sum, end-of-life phosphors represent the largest potential secondary Eu source, and methods are emerging to exploit it.  

• **Wastewater Treatment:**  REE processing and recycling often generates acidic, metal-rich effluents.  Conventional treatment co-precipitates REEs: adding lime (Ca(OH)₂) elevates pH, causing Eu(OH)₃ and other hydroxides to precipitate for removal.  Advanced options include constructed wetlands or membrane bioreactors: certain aquatic plants or algae can uptake Eu, and processes like osmosis or ion exchange can polish residual REEs.  Recovery from neutralization sludge is possible by re-dissolving in acid and re-extracting.  Zero-liquid-discharge systems (hybrid evaporation) are being piloted to minimize Eu loss and maximize salt reclamation.  

• **Soil Remediation:**  Areas contaminated by REE spills (e.g. old phosphor chalk from TV factories) can be remediated.  Soil washing with chelating agents (e.g. EDTA, citrate) can remove Eu, which is then reclaimed from the solution.  Certain hyperaccumulator plants have shown promise: for instance, the fern *Pteris vittata* or *Brassicaceae* species take up REEs from soil.  These plants could be used in phytoremediation plots to gradually extract Eu (and radioactive Th/U) from spoil.  Key is stabilization of radioactives: Eu often accompanies Th/U, so remediation includes selective precipitation of radionuclides at pH 7–10 and secure storage of any uranium residues.  

• **Radioactivity Management:**  Although ^151Eu/^153Eu are stable, many Eu sources contain trace ^{232}Th and ^{238}U.  Best practices dictate segregating radioactive waste.  After leaching, Th/U can be precipitated (e.g. as Th-PO₄ or UO₂) before final Eu isolation.  Modern facilities use engineered disposal (e.g. vaults) for Th/U waste.  For example, Energy Fuels’ White Mesa Mill is licensed for Th/U and uses a dedicated storage cell for radioactive tailings.  Ensuring compliance (US NRC, EU BSS Directive) is critical for any Eu production facility handling monazite or xenotime.

## Key Bottleneck summary  
Overall, the dominant bottleneck is **chemical separation capacity** specifically tuned for recovery of low-abundance elements like europium.  Western countries have neither the scale of SX processing plants nor decades of refinement experience that Chinese industry does.  China’s recent export controls have underscored that no Western facility can yet efficiently divide medium rare-earth concentrates into pure Eu₂O₃.  Combined with the fact that most allied ores contain well under 0.5% Eu₂O₃ (often ~0.1–0.2%) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/5/656#:~:text=,is%20shown%20as%20Figure%201)), this means allied Eu output will remain a tiny fraction of demand.  Even optimistic scenarios (Mountain Pass at 60 kt/yr or new monazite plants) project only tens of tonnes of Eu₂O₃, covering at best ~15–25% of the 2030 demand (150–200 t) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=While%20China%20accounts%20for%20approximately,For%20example%2C%20in)) ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40831-018-0162-8#:~:text=match%20at%20L707%20production%20of,3%7D%2C%20450%20tons)).  Without dramatic scale-up of specialized Eu separation and refining (or breakthrough technologies), Europe/US/Allies will stay heavily reliant on Chinese sources for high-purity europium.
