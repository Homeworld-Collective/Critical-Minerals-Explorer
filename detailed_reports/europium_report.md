## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
**United States:** Only one rare-earth mine (Mountain Pass, California) is active ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/effd6a7ec64b5830df9d3c76ab9b607a#:~:text=concern,global%20supply%20and%20dominates%20processing)). MP Materials reported ~9,084 t of rare-earth oxide (REO) concentrate in Q2 2024 ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-reports-second-quarter-2024-results/#:~:text=Rare%20earth%20concentrate%20%20,%282%2C048)) (~36,000 t/year), which contains roughly 6,850 t of europium (Eu) based on ore grades. In practice Eu is produced as a by-product (mixed RE oxide) at MP; U.S. companies like Energy Fuels are developing new sources (monazite sand in Florida/Georgia) to boost Eu supply.  
**Australia:** Mt Weld (Lynas Rare Earths) is the largest REE mine in allied nations ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australias-lynas-rare-earths-first-half-profit-slumps-85-2025-02-25/#:~:text=Lynas%20Rare%20Earths%2C%20the%20largest,earnings%20were%20impacted%20by%20weak)). It produces several thousand tonnes of REO annually (rich in NdPr, with smaller Eu fractions). For example, Lynas reported multi-kt revenue from Kalgoorlie/Mt Weld production in recent quarters, reflecting high output. Iluka Resources is also building an Australian refinery (supported by government funding) to process heavy-mineral sands (titanomagnetite/zircon) that contain minor Eu.  
**Canada:** No current large-scale REE mining; exploratory projects exist (e.g. Nechalacho, NioCorp), but Eu-containing production is negligible. Canada’s new REE strategy (Saskatoon processing hub) primarily targets NdPr.  
**European Union:** Essentially zero domestic Eu mining today. Key EU projects are pre-production: Leading Edge (Norra Kärr, Sweden) aims for ~5,340 t/year of mixed RE oxides (light REE) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%20light%20rare%20earths%20production)), Rare Earths Norway’s Fen project targets ~2,000 t/year (heavy and light REE) by ~2031 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=production.%20,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)), and Spain’s Matamulas ~1,500 t/year ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/#:~:text=,for%202%2C000%20tons%20by%202031)). None currently yield significant Eu; these will start after 2025. EU refining capacity is limited (Solvay La Rochelle plant partially reopened) so virtually all Eu is imported today.  
**Japan:** No domestic REE mining; Japanese firms (Shin-Etsu, TDK, etc.) import rare-earth oxides and produce magnets domestically. Japan houses >40% of global magnet-making capacity but relies on allied minerals for inputs.  
**Other Allies:** Norway/Iceland have no active REE mines. Allied scouts note Greenland’s Kvanefjeld deposit (Denmark/Greenland) is Eu-rich but not yet in production. NATO partners (e.g. Australia, Canada) are increasing exploration to fill gaps.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Phosphors and Lighting:** About 40–50% of Eu is used in red/blue phosphors for displays and fluorescent/LED lamps. Global Eu demand is projected to grow ~5.4%/yr into the 2030s ([www.fmiblog.com](https://www.fmiblog.com/2024/08/29/europium-a-critical-metal-in-high-demand-amid-growing-consumer-electronics-industry/#:~:text=The%20europium%20market%20%28Europium,technologies%20and%20clean%20energy%20solutions)) due to rising electronics and energy-efficient lighting. This implies compounded growth in US/EU demand (several thousand tonnes by 2030 if trends hold). For example, FMI reports Eu market value rising from $247 M (2024) toward $418 M by 2034 ([www.fmiblog.com](https://www.fmiblog.com/2024/08/29/europium-a-critical-metal-in-high-demand-amid-growing-consumer-electronics-industry/#:~:text=The%20europium%20market%20%28Europium,technologies%20and%20clean%20energy%20solutions)), indicating higher Eu volumes for color displays and lamps.  
• **Electronics & Defense:** Eu-based phosphors are crucial in consumer electronics (monitors, smart devices) for vivid colors ([www.fmiblog.com](https://www.fmiblog.com/2024/08/29/europium-a-critical-metal-in-high-demand-amid-growing-consumer-electronics-industry/#:~:text=Phosphors%20continue%20to%20be%20the,in%202024)). Emerging military/display tech (e.g. laser designators, secure photonic optics) uses Eu-doped materials, creating a steady “base load” demand. Exact 2030 forecasts are scarce, but allied defense planning assumes domestic Eu needs for critical systems.  
• **Nuclear Applications:** Eu isotopes (Eu-151/153) absorb neutrons, so Eu alloys are used in reactor control rods and dosimeters. Growth in nuclear energy (SMRs, research reactors) in allied countries (US, France, Japan) could modestly increase Eu demand.  
• **Recycling Offset:** Under the EU’s new Critical Materials Act, 25% of REEs must be met by recycling by 2030 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/science/zurich-researchers-pioneer-rare-earth-e-waste-recycling-2025-06-26/#:~:text=lamps,the%20technology%20with%20industrial%20partners)). For Eu, that could supply perhaps hundreds of tonnes/year (mainly from fluorescent lamp and e-waste recycling, as in the ETH Zurich process ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/science/zurich-researchers-pioneer-rare-earth-e-waste-recycling-2025-06-26/#:~:text=introduced%20a%20specially%20designed%20extractant,of%20its%20REE%20needs%20by))). Even with recycling, unmet demand (e.g. for advanced lighting, defense) may be on the order of several thousand tonnes combined for US + allied by 2030.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Expanded Mining Output:** MP Materials plans “Upstream 60K” to boost California concentrate to 60,000 t/yr. Energy Fuels (US) is modifying its White Mesa (Utah) mill to process 40–60,000 t/yr of monazite ore ([magneticsmag.com](https://magneticsmag.com/energy-fuels-roars-ahead-in-rare-earths-production-from-uranium-ore/#:~:text=mill%20to%20increase%20throughput%20to,tons%20per%20year%20of%20Tb)). According to Energy Fuels’ studies, processing 40–60 kt/yr monazite could yield ~4,000–6,000 t NdPr-oxide plus ~150–225 t Dy and 50–75 t Tb per year ([magneticsmag.com](https://magneticsmag.com/energy-fuels-roars-ahead-in-rare-earths-production-from-uranium-ore/#:~:text=mill%20to%20increase%20throughput%20to,tons%20per%20year%20of%20Tb)). Europium would appear as a smaller co-product fraction (monazite contains ~4–5% Eu). These steps could add a few thousand tonnes of Eu (or equivalent oxide) capacity in the U.S. by 2030.  
• **Allied Production Projects:** Australia’s Lynas is constructing a heavy-REE plant in Texas and expanding its Mt Weld output; Arafura (Australia) is commissioning a Nolans Bore plant (mainly NdPr). In Canada, Ucore’s upcoming Louisiana facility (MICRA/DOD project) will process imported ores into oxides. The Meteoric Resources (Australia) Caldeira ionic-clay project will provide 3,000 t/yr of mixed rare-earth carbonate to Ucore ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australias-meteoric-resources-supply-rare-earths-oxide-canadas-ucore-2024-08-21/#:~:text=3%2C000%20metric%20tons%20of%20rare,production%20facility%2C%20the%20Louisiana%20Strategic)), feeding US refinement. EU projects (Norra Kärr, Fen, Sokli/Finland) may contribute 1–8 kt/yr of REO post-2030.  
• **Recycling and Secondary Feed:** Recycling technologies (magnet and lamp recycling) are set to supply Eu-substitutes. For example, Less Common Metals and Carester (France) are building a magnet-recycling plant (Lacq) to produce ~1,400 t/yr of rare-earth oxides by 2027 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/uk-rare-earths-company-build-plant-france-2025-05-29/#:~:text=The%20%E2%82%AC110%20million%20,for%20use%20by%20magnet%20producers)); although these oxides are rich in Nd/Dy, they will contain trace Eu. Likewise, ETH Zurich has developed an extractant to recover Eu from end-of-life fluorescent lamps ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/science/zurich-researchers-pioneer-rare-earth-e-waste-recycling-2025-06-26/#:~:text=introduced%20a%20specially%20designed%20extractant,of%20its%20REE%20needs%20by)). U.S. policy now incentivizes extracting REEs from mine/coal waste ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/us-prioritizes-recovery-critical-minerals-mine-waste-2025-07-24/#:~:text=The%20U,S)). These secondary sources may add only hundreds of tonnes of Eu-equivalent feed by 2030.  
• **Overall Balance:** Even aggregating expanded mining + recycling, US/allied Eu (or Eu₂O₃) supply by 2030 is expected to be on the order of a few thousand tonnes per year, still short of projected demand. Current plans (e.g. domestic separations, new mines) will significantly increase output, but at least 50–70% of Eu needs may still require imports or stockpiles unless further projects accelerate.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric Surveys:** Many Eu-bearing ores (carbonatites, monazites) contain thorium/uranium. Airborne and ground gamma-ray surveys detect radioactive anomalies, flagging REE prospect areas. (Historically, sites like Mountain Pass and Mt Weld showed high U/Th signatures.)  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemical Sampling:** Identification of carbonatite intrusions, alkaline complexes or ion-exchange clays guides exploration. Regional mapping outlines plug-like carbonatites, nepheline syenites or sedimentary rare-earth deposits. Systematic soil, stream-sediment or rock-chip sampling for REE (including Ce, Nd, Eu proxies) reveals concentration anomalies.  
• **Remote Sensing & Geophysics:** Multi-spectral satellite imagery (ASTER, Landsat) and LIDAR can detect alteration minerals (e.g. carbonates) associated with Eu-hosting rocks. Airborne magnetic/gravity surveys outline buried carbonatites and pegmatites. Hyperspectral scanning may identify europium-specific absorption features in outcrop.  
• **Drilling & Downhole Logging:** Reverse-circulation and core drilling of targets yields samples for assay. Borehole tools (spectral gamma-ray, fluorescence) can measure Eu/U/Th in situ. Drill programs combined with 3D modeling narrow deposit geometry.  
• **Data Analytics & AI:** Geospatial machine learning is increasingly used to integrate geochemical and geophysical datasets to prioritize targets. Software tools (e.g. GIS-based prospectivity models) help find subtle Eu anomalies in large terrains.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Acid Leaching & Precipitation:** Crushed ore (e.g. bastnäsite, xenotime, monazite) is typically treated with hot sulfuric or hydrochloric acid to dissolve REE into solution. For example, Energy Fuels dissolves monazite via sulfuric acid roast. Subsequent pH adjustment or oxalate precipitation separates “rare earth carbonate” which is calcined to RE oxide, including Eu₂O₃. Lower-grade ion-adsorption clays (Brazil, SE Asia) are treated with milder ammonium/salt solutions to leach out adsorbed REEs. The Brazilian Caldeira clay project will use such leaching for mixed rare-earth carbonate ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/australias-meteoric-resources-supply-rare-earths-oxide-canadas-ucore-2024-08-21/#:~:text=3%2C000%20metric%20tons%20of%20rare,production%20facility%2C%20the%20Louisiana%20Strategic)).  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The industry standard for REE recovery. Multistage SX units sequentially treat the leachate with organic extractants (e.g. D2EHPA, HDEHP) in kerosene or LIX-84I diluents, selectively capturing individual lanthanides. Eu, as a light REE, is co-extracted with Sm/Nd in initial stages and then separated in later SX stages. Phoenix Tailings notes that “traditional solvent extraction methods for refining rare earths are costly and environmentally harmful” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bmw-yamaha-motor-back-us-rare-earths-startup-phoenix-tailings-2024-12-31/#:~:text=outside%20China,Phoenix%20Tailings%20claims%20its)), motivating advanced processes.  
• **Ion-Exchange Chromatography:** High-resolution separation using resin columns or filter-press columns with chelating resins (e.g. sulfonated crown ethers) enables very pure Eu recovery.  This is used in niche recovery (medical isotopes) and is being scaled up.  
• **Ionic Liquids & Novel Solvents:** Lab-scale research shows ionic liquid extractants (undiluted ammonium or primitive organic salts) can preferentially separate Eu from Sm or Gd. For example, undiluted quaternary ammonium salts have separated Sm and Eu for medical isotopes, implying potential for Eu refining. These methods are not yet commercial, but illustrate alternative chemistries.  
• **Molten Salt (Pyro) Processes:** Direct electrochemical or precipitation reduction of REEs in molten chloride or fluoride salt (¬electrolysis) is under development. Phoenix Tailings (US startup) is pioneering a molten-salt electrolysis method to recover RE metals (including Eu) with “minimal emissions” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/bmw-yamaha-motor-back-us-rare-earths-startup-phoenix-tailings-2024-12-31/#:~:text=outside%20China,Phoenix%20Tailings%20claims%20its)), bypassing aqueous SX entirely. This high-temperature route could yield Eu metal alloys directly from mixed oxides.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (Selective SX):** Conventional SX is also used intra-refinery. Special ligand cocktails (e.g. di-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid plus 2-ethylhexanol) are tuned to extract Eu³⁺ selectively over neighbors.  Sophisticated SX circuits (with hundreds of stages) can isolate Eu₂O₃ to >99% purity. Allied firms are reviving SX practice (e.g. Solvay’s La Rochelle) to meet this challenge.  
• **Chromatographic Resin Bays:** Chelating polymer beads (e.g. silica-supported crown ethers) are used in columns to “grab” Eu from a mixed feed. Techniques akin to chromatographic medical isotope purification are being evaluated for scaling. Such methods can achieve very fine separations between adjacent lanthanides.  
• **Distillation of Halides / Molten Salts:** In metallization, Eu₂O₃ is often converted to EuCl₃ or EuF₃ and reduced by Ca/Mg. The crude metal/distilled salt mixture is then vacuum-distilled at ~1600°C: Eu (b.p. ~1678°C) vaporizes and recondenses on cold finger, separating it from less-volatile contaminants. Western projects will use sealed-tube distillation or electrowinning on chloride melts to refine Eu metal.  
• **Precipitation/Chemical Methods:** After reduction, selective oxidation or precipitation can purify Eu. For example, Zn or V⁴⁺ reduction can partially down-convert Eu³⁺ to Eu²⁺ which follows different solubility, aiding separation. Similarly, controlled pH precipitation (as carbonate/hydroxide) can separate Eu if carefully buffered. These methods are auxiliary to SX, allowing final fine-tuning of purity.  
• **Emerging Electrochemical Methods:** Research explores electrodes that selectively capture Eu ions (e.g. electrochemical pumping with tailored voltages). Though experimental, this electro-separation could eventually provide pure Eu without organics.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metal Reduction:** High-purity Eu metal is typically made by reducing Eu₂O₃ with a strong reductant (e.g. molten calcium or lanthanum) in a sealed vessel. This produces a Eu-metal/calcium fluoride mixture, from which Eu is vacuum-distilled (as above). Allied refiners use improved furnaces (vacuum arc, induction) with careful control to minimize Ca incorporation. Phoenix-style molten salt routes may eventually allow direct solid Eu cathode production.  
• **Vacuum Distillation & Zone Refining:** After initial metal production, multiple vacuum distillations remove residual impurities. Zone refining of solid Eu (repeatedly melting a small zone along a rod) can achieve 5N+ (99.999%) purity for semiconductor-grade Eu. These thermal methods require extensive vacuum apparatus.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Purification:** For Eu salts (nitrates, chlorides), successive recrystallizations (or solvent washes) are used. For example, converting Eu compounds to Eu₂O₃ via precipitation (oxalate, carbonate) and calcining multiple times removes chloride or rare byproducts.  New ion-specific membrane filters (solvent-resistant nanofiltration) are being tested to polish REE solutions before final precipitation.  
• **Alloying/Forming:** Purified Eu is often cast into master alloys (e.g. Eu–La) for handling. Vacuum induction melting or electron-beam melting produces ingots. Allied aerospace-grade Eu alloys require inert-atmosphere casting to avoid oxidation. This metallurgical fabrication is the last step before delivery to end-users.  
• **Gas-Phase Refining (Plasma):** Experimental methods (rare in EU/US) use plasmas or gaseous reagents to scrub trace elements. For instance, chlorine-chlorate gas leaches can purify metals by converting residual actinides/others to volatile chlorides. These remain mostly in study phase.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Mine Waste Reprocessing:** New policies incentivize treating tailings/coal refuse for REE recovery ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/land-use-biodiversity/us-prioritizes-recovery-critical-minerals-mine-waste-2025-07-24/#:~:text=The%20U,S)). In practice, this uses leaching (acid/alkali) of waste piles followed by SX/precipitation to extract Eu. For example, alkaline fly ash from coal plants can be acid-leached to pull Eu into solution, then neutralized to precipitate other contaminants. This both remediates waste and recovers Eu.  
• **Water Treatment:** Effluent from REE plants contains dissolved heavy metals and radionuclides. Technologies include precipitation (e.g. raising pH to precipitate rare-earth hydroxides) and ion-exchange/adsorption. Synthetic zeolites or specialized resins capture Eu, Th and U from wastewater. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes (coupled with chemical oxidation) are used at allied sites to clean tailings ponds to below regulatory discharge limits.  
• **Phytoremediation & Crop Exchange:** Certain plants (ferns, bamboo) hyper-accumulate REEs. Trials in Europe/US test planting these over low-grade stockpiles and then harvesting the biomass to strip Eu out of shallow soils. Genetically selecting high-Eu accumulator varieties can fix and concentrate residual Eu. This low-tech approach is adjunct to hard engineering.  
• **Radiation Control:** Because Eu ores often carry radionuclides, allied refiners employ radiochemical remediation: lime neutralization fixes dissolved radium, and sulfide precipitation (adding Na₂S) locks out lead/uranium as insoluble minerals. Off-gas scrubbers (HEPA filters, caustic scrubbers) remove airborne radioactive particulates from drying or roasting processes.  
• **Closed-Loop Chemistry:** Modern plants recycle reagents to minimize effluent. For example, solvent extraction organic phases are cleaned and reused; spent acids are neutralized and recycled via evaporative crystallizers. Alliance-led R&D (DOE/NRC projects) is developing biodegradable lixiviants and greener extractants to reduce secondary pollution from Eu processing.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The most critical bottleneck is **rare-earth separation and refining**: allied nations lack large-scale processing plants to convert mixed REE concentrates into individual oxides/metals. China’s decades of expertise in multi-stage solvent extraction means new Western facilities (e.g. the Texas and France plants) must build capacity from scratch. In short, the midstream hydrometallurgy (solvent-extraction) step is the chokepoint ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=Efforts%20to%20diversify%20supply%20include,Policymakers%20consider%20subsidies%2C%20Contracts%20for)) – without sufficient SX/refining infrastructure and know-how, expanded mining cannot fully translate into pure Eu output.  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
The dominant bottleneck for U.S./allied europium production is chemical **separation capacity** ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=Efforts%20to%20diversify%20supply%20include,Policymakers%20consider%20subsidies%2C%20Contracts%20for)). China’s existing monopoly on solvent-extraction and refining technology leaves allied projects struggling to finalize pure Eu. New processing innovations (e.g. ionic liquids, pyro-metallurgy) are promising but unproven at scale. Hence, until commercial-scale, multi-stage SX and refining facilities come online, allied Eu output will remain limited relative to projected demand ([time.com](https://time.com/7294964/us-rare-earths-minerals-china-dominance-trump-tariffs/#:~:text=Efforts%20to%20diversify%20supply%20include,Policymakers%20consider%20subsidies%2C%20Contracts%20for)).
