## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States (US):** 0 t. The US has had no active tungsten mines since about 2015 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=its%20high%20melting%20point%2C%20hardness%2C,This%20includes%20imposing%20tariffs%20and)). There are no operating US sources, and the last producers (e.g. high‐grade scheelite deposits) have been idled. The US relies entirely on imports (mostly finished products or concentrates) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=its%20high%20melting%20point%2C%20hardness%2C,This%20includes%20imposing%20tariffs%20and)).  
• **Canada:** 0 t. Historic Canadian mines (Cantung, NWT) closed by 2015. Canada’s known deposits (e.g. Cantung and the Mactung skarn) are under development, but as of 2024 no production. The Cold-Climate Mactung deposit (Yukon–NWT) has ~290,000 t WO₃ resource ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6262590#:~:text=2021%2C%20the%20latest%20price%20was,%28%28Capitalight%20Research)), making it one of the world’s largest high-grade tungsten deposits, but it is still pre-production. Thus Canadian domestic output remains nil pending new mine startups ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=its%20high%20melting%20point%2C%20hardness%2C,This%20includes%20imposing%20tariffs%20and)) ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6262590#:~:text=2021%2C%20the%20latest%20price%20was,%28%28Capitalight%20Research)).  
• **Australia:** ~1,000 t in 2024. Australia has several tungsten producers. EQ Resources’ Mount Carbine mine (Qld) and Group 6 Metals’ revived Dolphin/Kara mine (Tas) account for most output. Geoscience Australia reports ~2.9 kt WO₃ reserves at Kara (Tas) and minimal production historically ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/tungsten#:~:text=As%20at%20December%202018%2C%20Proved,relatively%20small%20overall%20production%20rate)). However, by 2024 output rose (~1,000 t) as multiple smaller deposits came online ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=7)). The PNG-Inmine Hemerdon deposit (Wolf Minerals/UK) is not in Australia; all operating Australian mines are smaller, open-pit scheelite/quartz vein bodies.  
• **European Union (EU):** ~2,000 t. Key EU producers in 2024 were Austria (~800 t), Spain (~700 t), and Portugal (~500 t) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=8)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=9)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=10)). For example, Austria’s Wolfram Bergbau/Ost mine (Mittersill) supplied ~800 t, Spain’s Barruecopardo and Los Santos (Saloro/Almonty) ~700 t, and Portugal’s Panasqueira (Almonty) ~500 t. Reserve bases are modest (Austria ~10 kt W ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=8)), Spain ~66 kt W ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=9)), Portugal ~3.4 kt W ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=10))) but current production is in the low hundreds of tonnes per country. Other EU nations (e.g. UK, Sweden) produce negligible tungsten today.  
• **Other Allies (Norway, Iceland, Japan):** ~0 t. None of these countries has active tungsten mining. Japan and Norway import tungsten concentrates/metals. Japan has some tungsten metallurgy (e.g. powder producers using imported feedstock), but no domestic ore production.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **Growth sectors:** Cemented carbide and superalloys dominate tungsten demand. USGS notes the largest end use is tungsten carbide in hard-metal tools ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/tungsten-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Tungsten%20,for%20lead%20in%20bullets%20and)). In 2014 US consumption was ~11,600 t (1,000's of t) with ~6,880 t in cemented carbides ([www.indexmundi.com](https://www.indexmundi.com/en/commodities/minerals/tungsten/tungsten_t5.html#:~:text=Other%20alloys,)).  Demand is expected to grow in manufacturing (cutting/drilling tools) and aerospace/defense (heavy alloy counterweights, penetrators) through 2030 ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/tungsten-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Tungsten%20,for%20lead%20in%20bullets%20and)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20conflict%20over%20critical%20minerals,countries%20highly%20reliant%20on%20Chinese)).  
• **Defense and heavy industry:** Tungsten heavy alloys are used in kinetic penetrators, rocket subcomponents, and military lighting. Modern warfare and infrastructure (e.g. *FT* commentary) suggest rising strategic demand, especially for US/NATO militaries ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=The%20conflict%20over%20critical%20minerals,countries%20highly%20reliant%20on%20Chinese)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/tungsten-statistics-and-information/#:~:text=Tungsten%20,for%20lead%20in%20bullets%20and)).  For example, tungsten’s unique properties (highest melting point, density) drive its use in jet engine turbine blades and munitions, sectors that are projected to expand.  
• **Projected tonnage:** No single public forecast is available, but by 2030 US+allied consumption can be roughly estimated from global trends.  Global tungsten demand was ~81,000 t in 2024 ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=With%20that%20in%20mind%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,in%20South%20Korea%20and%20Australia)) with China ~67,000 t. Removing China’s ~80% implies Western consumption ~14,000 t ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-five-new-critical-metal-exports-restricted-by-china-2025-02-04/#:~:text=1.%20,controls%20impact%20eight%20tungsten%20products)) ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=With%20that%20in%20mind%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,in%20South%20Korea%20and%20Australia)). Even modest growth (3–5%/yr) in industrial activity would raise US/allies demand to on the order of **15–20,000 t** by 2030, with the majority in hard-metal tooling and defense ([www.nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/top-10-tungsten-p-roducing-countries-updated-2024#:~:text=With%20that%20in%20mind%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,in%20South%20Korea%20and%20Australia)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-five-new-critical-metal-exports-restricted-by-china-2025-02-04/#:~:text=1.%20,controls%20impact%20eight%20tungsten%20products)). Recent studies indicate global tungsten market value is set to increase (CAGR ~3–4% to 2030), implying similar tonnage growth in major markets.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **New mine development:** Projected allied supply hinges on startup of key projects outside China.  Canada’s Mactung (Fireweed Metals) could begin production in the late 2020s; its huge resource (290,000 t WO₃ ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6262590#:~:text=2021%2C%20the%20latest%20price%20was,%28%28Capitalight%20Research))) could yield several thousand tonnes per year of WO₃-concentrate once in operation. In Europe, Barruecopardo (Spain) resumed production (~1.5 Mt ore/year crush, ~80–82% recovery ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=The%20Barruecopardo%20mine%20is%20a,Martin%2C%20Director%20of%20the%20site))) and others (Los Santos, Panasqueira) will continue contributing (~500–700 t W each). Australia’s restart of Dolphin/Kara and expanded mines (Mt. Carbine) will supply ~1–2 kt. **If all projects ramp up**, combined domestic/projected allied output might approach **~5,000 to 10,000 t/year** by 2030 (still well below total demand). These figures assume Barruecopardo’s 1.5 Mt/y and similar-scale projects: e.g. Barruecopardo processes 1.5 Mt ore with ~80% scheelite recovery ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=The%20Barruecopardo%20mine%20is%20a,Martin%2C%20Director%20of%20the%20site)), roughly yielding 1,200 t of WO₃ concentrate (≈840 t W) per year. Mactung’s high grade and size could supply a significant fraction of North American needs once active ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6262590#:~:text=2021%2C%20the%20latest%20price%20was,%28%28Capitalight%20Research)).  
• **Recycling and secondary supply:** Allies are also investing in recycling tungsten-bearing scrap (e.g. end-of-life carbide tools, mining scraps). Pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical recycling plants (mostly in EU, Japan) can recover ~80–90% of W from scrap. While precise volumes are proprietary, industry analyses suggest recycling will supply **at least several hundred tonnes** per year by 2030. For example, US consumers report growing scrap recovery from tool remelting and direct reuse. However, without first-stage production, scrap alone cannot fill the gap.  
• **Processing capacity and imports:** Even with mining additions, allied tungsten processing (to powders, APT, FeW) remains limited. So meaningful “domestic supply” in 2030 will include tungsten compounds and alloys imported from allied-friendly sources (e.g. Japan or possibly scaled-up Korea/EU plants) rather than raw ore. In summary, by 2030 US/allied supply is expected to remain on the order of only a few thousand tonnes per year, derived from new allied mines and recycling ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=The%20Barruecopardo%20mine%20is%20a,Martin%2C%20Director%20of%20the%20site)) ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6262590#:~:text=2021%2C%20the%20latest%20price%20was,%28%28Capitalight%20Research)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Aerial Radiometric Surveys:** Though tungsten minerals are not inherently radioactive, tungsten often occurs in skarns or greisens with uranium/thorium pathfinders. Airborne gamma-ray surveys can highlight U/Th anomalies in granitic terrains, indirectly pointing to possible tungsten-gold or uranium-copper skarn systems (e.g. Canada’s Yukon, Colorado Plateau) ([www.sciencepg.com](https://www.sciencepg.com/article/10.11648/j.earth.20241303.12#:~:text=On%20the%20field%2C%20tungsten%20%28scheelite%29,Scheelite)).  
• **UV-Fluorescence Mapping:** Scheelite (CaWO₄), a major tungsten ore, strongly fluoresces bright blue under ultraviolet light. Field or drone-mounted UV lamps can illuminate scheelite-bearing veins. For example, exploration crews use UV surveys (Heli-flars or handheld lamps) to trace scheelite in quartz veins, as documented in Cameroon ([www.sciencepg.com](https://www.sciencepg.com/article/10.11648/j.earth.20241303.12#:~:text=On%20the%20field%2C%20tungsten%20%28scheelite%29,Scheelite)).  
• **Geological Mapping and Geochemistry:** Seeking host environments – such as granitic intrusions with greisen alteration or contact skarns – guides discovery. Detailed mapping identifies quartz veins, calc-silicate zones and hydrothermal alteration (e.g. scheelite typically in hornfelses or skarn facies). Geochemical soil and rock sampling can detect tungsten or associated indicators (e.g. Mo, Sn, Bi) anomalies above mineralization. For example, stream-sediment sampling has been used to outline hard-rock W targets.  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** High-density tungsten minerals can produce minor gravity anomalies if deposits are large. Magnetometer surveys can highlight magnetite-rich skarns often spatially associated with scheelite. Induced polarization (IP) may detect disseminated sulphides (e.g. arsenopyrite) that occur with tungsten. Modern approaches also use hyperspectral and satellite (Landsat/ASTER) data to map alteration minerals (mica, chlorite, epidote) typical of tungsten systems ([www.sciencepg.com](https://www.sciencepg.com/article/10.11648/j.earth.20241303.12#:~:text=%28Adamawa%20Cameroon%29%20Using%20Ultra,Mbowou%20Gbambie%20Isaac%20Bertrand%2C%20Ngounouno)).  
• **Techniques Integration:** In practice, modern exploration combines techniques. For example, analysts have applied Landsat-8 imagery processing along with UV survey data to efficiently locate scheelite-rich veins in new districts ([www.sciencepg.com](https://www.sciencepg.com/article/10.11648/j.earth.20241303.12#:~:text=%28Adamawa%20Cameroon%29%20Using%20Ultra,Mbowou%20Gbambie%20Isaac%20Bertrand%2C%20Ngounouno)), demonstrating multi-sensor discovery workflows for tungsten.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Conventional Hard-Rock Mining:** Tungsten ores (wolframite/scheelite veins and skarns) are mined by drill-and-blast. Barruecopardo (Spain) uses standard open-pit benches with drilling, blasting and load-haul-dump to remove ore ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=The%20initial%20step%20is%20the,start%20of%20the%20processing%20area)). High-grade veins (e.g. Cantung, past Canadian mines) employ underground methods such as cut-and-fill or shrinkage stoping to selectively mine steep ore shoots. Large-tonnage projects (e.g. Mactung) plan underground decline and stope operations. In all cases, heavy excavators, LHDs and haul trucks move ore to surface.  ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=The%20initial%20step%20is%20the,start%20of%20the%20processing%20area))  
• **Ore Crushing and Grinding:** Primary crushers (jaw, gyratory) reduce run-of-mine rock to sub–10 cm. Secondary crushing (cone or HPGR) and SAG/AG mills grind ore typically to <200 µm. Barruecopardo’s plant, for instance, crushes ore to 0–5 mm ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=The%20initial%20step%20is%20the,start%20of%20the%20processing%20area)) before concentration. High-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are used in Austria (Mittersill) and some modern plants to improve energy efficiency on fine tungsten ores.  
• **Gravitational Concentration:** Given tungsten minerals’ high density, dense-media separation is key. On site, tunsgten ore is often pre-concentrated via jigs, spirals or shaking tables right after crushing. These gravity units recover coarse wolframite/scheelite before flotation. For example, Barruecopardo’s processing uses multiple gravity (gravimetric) circuits ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20process%20comprises%20a%20crushing,%E2%80%9D%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Martin%20explains)) to roughly triple ore grading.  
• **Hydraulic Mining and Tailings:** Though not novel for tungsten, adjacent techniques like high-pressure water jets have been tested to remove weathered tungsten ore in placer-like deposits. Most tailings are pumped to impoundments; some modern projects (e.g. Sangdong/Korea) are evaluating tailings reprocessing (scavenging residual W) using re-crushing and re-floating.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Dense-Media Separation:** Early separation often uses heavy-liquid cyclones or baths. A ferrosilicon-water slurry provides a medium (~ρ=2.7–3.0 g/cc) that separates dense scheelite/wolframite (ρ≈6–7) from lighter waste ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20process%20comprises%20a%20crushing,%E2%80%9D%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Martin%20explains)). This produces a tungsten-rich rougher product and a lighter tail.  
• **Gravity Tables and Jigs:** Following dense media, gravity tables (Wilfley) and jigs boost purity. These devices exploit slight differences in mineral density and shape. They are especially effective for coarse scheelite (to ~0.5 mm). Many plants (Europe, Australia) also use spiral concentrators on finer fractions. Barruecopardo’s circuit of “gravimetric equipment” implies such tables and spirals ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20process%20comprises%20a%20crushing,%E2%80%9D%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Martin%20explains)).  
• **Magnetic Separation:** Wolframite ((Fe,Mn)WO₄) is paramagnetic; low-intensity magnetic separators (LIMS) can pull it from mixed heavy concentrates. Magnetic separation is routine on wolframite circuits (for example, at Mittersill in Austria). Scheelite (non-magnetic) requires alternate methods, so after any magnetics, flotation/gravity handles remaining tungsten.  
• **Flotation:** Froth flotation is used on fine-grained or silicate-rich concentrates. Collectors (commonly sodium oleate or butyl xanthate) preferentially float scheelite from siliceous gangue ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20process%20comprises%20a%20crushing,%E2%80%9D%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Martin%20explains)). In Europe/Japan, plants include a flotation stage after gravity to upgrade to final concentrate (~60–70% WO₃).  (No single reference here, but this is standard practice corroborated by industry texts, and implied by Barruecopardo’s concentrate quality ([www.metso.com](https://www.metso.com/insights/case-studies/mining-and-metals/reopened-tungsten-mine-operating-at-full-speed/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20process%20comprises%20a%20crushing,%E2%80%9D%20Jes%C3%BAs%20Martin%20explains)).)  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Ammonium Paratungstate (APT) Process:** Concentrates are converted to a refined intermediate. Tungsten oxides (WO₃) or scheelite are digested (typically with H₂O₂ or NaOH) to yield soluble tungstate. Ammonia is added to precipitate ammonium paratungstate. APT crystallization plants (common in China/Japan) enable shipment of a stable, high-purity tungsten precursor. Geoscience Australia notes that “tungsten is not typically sold as raw ore… [but as] ammonium paratungstate (APT)” ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/tungsten#:~:text=Tungsten%20is%20not%20typically%20sold,3)).  
• **Hydrogen Reduction:** Calcined WO₃ or APT is reduced in hydrogen furnaces at ∼800–1000 °C to metallic tungsten powder. This multi-stage process yields ‘brittle tungsten’ which can be milled. World’s largest producers (H.C. Starck, Kennametal) use hydrogen furnaces in sealed vacuum or pressurized systems to avoid re-oxidation.  
• **Ferrotungsten Smelting:** For applications in steel, WO₃ is fused with carbon (coke) and ferrosilicon in electric-arc furnaces to produce Fe–W alloys (typically 75% W). This carbothermic reduction melts the charge under argon; after cooling and crushing, high-purity ferrotungsten is recovered (often >80% W in final FeW). Western Steel mills use imported FeW, as few domestic smelters exist.  
• **Carbide & Alloy Fabrication:** Tungsten metal is carburized (often via tungsten carbide powder routes) or sintered with cobalt to make WC-Co cemented-carbide parts. Allied firms (e.g. Kennametal, Japan’s Kawasaki Heavy) dominate tooling manufacture. High-purity electrolysis or thermal plasma methods (emerging R&D) are under study for specialty tungsten powders, but conventional chemical reduction remains primary ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/tungsten#:~:text=Tungsten%20is%20not%20typically%20sold,3)).  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Given tungsten’s value and stability, many old mine wastes can be treated. Modern operations may re-crush tailings and use gravity/flotation to extract residual WO₃. This simultaneously reduces environmental footprint. For example, Canada’s Cantung site roots for possible tailings recovery to offset clean-up costs ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6262590#:~:text=Cantung%2C%20roughly%20160%20kilometres%20southeast,care%20and%20maintenance%20ever%20since)).  
• **Hydrometallurgical Extraction:** Advanced chemical methods can remediate co-contaminants while recovering tungsten. Recent research demonstrates using deep-eutectic solvents together with electrodialysis to leach W and associated arsenic from old tailings ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06591#:~:text=coupling%20DES%20in%20a%20two,This)). In one study, an ED cell (100 mA, 4 days) removed ~77% of tungsten from Panasqueira mine residues, allowing reuse of treated tailings ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06591#:~:text=coupling%20DES%20in%20a%20two,This)).  
• **Water Treatment & Stabilization:** Standard practices (lime precipitation, ion exchange) can remove tungsten from drainage waters if needed. Tungsten forms tungstate (WO₄²⁻) which can be captured by anion exchange resins in extreme cases. More typically, remediation focuses on arsenic/sulfate in skarn tailings, with tungsten essentially insoluble after neutralization.  
• **Bioremediation (Research):** Preliminary studies have explored tungsten uptake by plants or microbes. Certain fungi and grasses show limited tungsten absorption from soil. While not yet commercialized, phytostabilization (planting to prevent erosion of W-bearing tailings) is sometimes applied. These bioremediation routes are experimental, but represent future options for low-level W contamination.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The critical bottleneck is **downstream processing** (chemical refining) of tungsten concentrate.  Even with new Western mines, the lack of domestic facilities to convert raw ore into saleable tungsten products (like ammonium paratungstate and tungsten metal powders) stymies supply. Nearly all technology and capacity for these steps resides in China/Japan; the West has only a handful of small scrap recyclers.  In effect, without a home-grown APT/powder plant or FeW smelter, new ore can’t be economically utilized.  In commentary on China’s export curbs, experts noted that “controls on APT and tungsten carbide could be the most affected due to the limited availability of alternatives outside China” ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/shares-china-tungsten-producers-rally-beijings-latest-export-curbs-2025-02-05/#:~:text=3,la%20limitada%20disponibilidad%20de%20alternativas)).  Thus, **purification/refining technology** (APT plants, hydrogen-reduction furnaces, etc.) is the bottleneck.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Despite planned allied mining projects, the failure point is processing, not ore.  The U.S. and partners lack commercial facilities (autoclave digesters, hydrogen-reduction for WO₃, etc.) to turn concentrate into tungsten metal or carbide; virtually all high-purity W production is abroad ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/minerals/mineral-resources-and-advice/australian-resource-reviews/tungsten#:~:text=Tungsten%20is%20not%20typically%20sold,3)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/shares-china-tungsten-producers-rally-beijings-latest-export-curbs-2025-02-05/#:~:text=3,la%20limitada%20disponibilidad%20de%20alternativas)).  Without domestic APT/powder capacity, even sizable Western mine output would depend on foreign (primarily Chinese or Japanese) refineries.  In short, advanced refinement of tungsten concentrate is the single chokepoint limiting US/allied production.
