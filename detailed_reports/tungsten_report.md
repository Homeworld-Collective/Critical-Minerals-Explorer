## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: APT/powder plants; hydrogen reduction furnaces; ferrotungsten smelters*  

The critical bottleneck is **downstream processing** of tungsten concentrate. The U.S. and allies have virtually no domestic capacity to refine ore into intermediates (like sodium tungstate/APT) or metal powders – those refining facilities are almost entirely in China ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=its%20high%20melting%20point%2C%20hardness%2C,This%20includes%20imposing%20tariffs%20and)) ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=,Japan%20and%20the)). For example, Reuters reports that China controls over 80% of the global tungsten market ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=its%20high%20melting%20point%2C%20hardness%2C,This%20includes%20imposing%20tariffs%20and)) (about 83% of production in 2024 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/west-frets-over-chinas-interest-vietnam-tungsten-mine-sources-say-2025-08-27/#:~:text=China%20accounted%20for%2083,exited%20its%20German%20tungsten%20business))), and analysts note that export curbs on key products (e.g. ammonium paratungstate and tungsten carbide) will hurt Western users because few non-Chinese sources exist ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/shares-china-tungsten-producers-rally-beijings-latest-export-curbs-2025-02-05/#:~:text=productos%20especializados%20de%20tungsteno%20utilizados,la%20limitada%20disponibilidad%20de%20alternativas)). USGS analysis likewise highlights that most major tungsten mining countries lack local smelters/refineries and export their concentrate for processing in Asia ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=,Japan%20and%20the)). In short, even if new Western mines open, without local APT plants or tungsten oxide reduction and electric-arc ferrotungsten smelters, the ore still must be sent abroad ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=,Japan%20and%20the)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/shares-china-tungsten-producers-rally-beijings-latest-export-curbs-2025-02-05/#:~:text=productos%20especializados%20de%20tungsteno%20utilizados,la%20limitada%20disponibilidad%20de%20alternativas)).  

**Key Bottleneck Summary:** Despite many proposed mine projects, the choke point is refinement, not raw ore.  China (and to a lesser extent Japan/Korea) host almost all APT/powder plants and ferrotungsten mills, whereas the West largely has only limited scrap recycling.  Thus the lack of domestic purification/refining technology radically limits any increase in US/allied tungsten production ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=,Japan%20and%20the)) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/shares-china-tungsten-producers-rally-beijings-latest-export-curbs-2025-02-05/#:~:text=productos%20especializados%20de%20tungsteno%20utilizados,la%20limitada%20disponibilidad%20de%20alternativas)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: ~3,000 t/yr total allied production*  

- **United States (US):** ~0 t. The U.S. has had no commercial tungsten mining since the last mine closed in 2015 ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=its%20high%20melting%20point%2C%20hardness%2C,This%20includes%20imposing%20tariffs%20and)).  There are no active tungsten ore producers, so all U.S. supply comes from imports of concentrates or finished products.  

- **Canada:** ~0 t. Canada’s lone historical tungsten mine (Cantung, NW Territories) shut in 2015.  No Canadian primary tungsten production occurred in 2023.  Canada’s key project is the Mactung deposit (Yukon/NWT) – one of the world’s largest high-grade resources (Indicated 41.5 Mt at 0.73% WO₃) ([fireweedmetals.com](https://fireweedmetals.com/fireweed-metals-announces-mineral-resources-for-the-mactung-project-the-largest-high-grade-tungsten-deposit-in-the-world/#:~:text=,WO_%7B3)) – but it is still in development and not yet producing.  

- **Australia:** ~<1,000 t. Australia has restarted a few tungsten operations in 2023.  For example, EQ Resources reopened the Mount Carbine mine (Queensland) – Stage 2 (open-pit) was brought online in mid-2023, targeting about 4,000 t/yr of tungsten concentrate ([www.nrmmrrd.qld.gov.au](https://www.nrmmrrd.qld.gov.au/mining-exploration/investors/critical-minerals/current-projects/mt-carbine#:~:text=re,around%204%2C000t%20of%20tungsten%20concentrate)).  King Island Scheelite (Tasmania, “Dolphin” mine) reached commercial output in mid-2023 ([g6m.com.au](https://g6m.com.au/dolphin-project/production/#:~:text=In%20July%202023%2C%20the%20Company,located%20on%20King%20Island%2C%20Tasmania)), though initial production was small.  Combined, Australian mines supplied on the order of only a few hundred tonnes of contained tungsten in 2023, with the potential to increase in 2024.  

- **European Union (EU):** ~a few thousand tonnes. Key active EU sources include Austria’s Mittersill mine (Wolfram Bergbau), Spain’s Barruecopardo (Saloro/Ormonde, now part of EQ Resources), and Portugal’s Panasqueira (Almonty). These legacy mines and local processing plants produce on the order of 1–2 kt WO₃ per year each.  (Austria, Spain, and Portugal together provide a modest non-Chinese supply.) No recent unified EU production figure is published, but these operations collectively contribute a few thousand tonnes of contained tungsten annually.  

- **Other Allies:** ~500 t.  South Korea’s Sangdong mine (Almonty) reopened in 2023 with a projected capacity of several thousand tonnes of concentrate (≈3,000 t W) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=supply,The%20rising%20challenge%20for%20Western)), though first production is just ramping up.  Japan and Norway have negligible tungsten mining; they rely on imports (Japan has some end-use metallurgy, but no raw ore source).  Other allies like Iceland have no tungsten output.  Overall, aside from the projects above, allied production outside China remains negligible.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 18,000–22,000 t/yr projected demand*  

- **Growth sectors:** Cemented tungsten carbide (hard-metals) dominate demand.  USGS notes that ~60% of tungsten consumption is for cemented-carbide tooling (metalworking, mining, construction) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/tungsten-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Tungsten%20,for%20lead%20in%20bullets%20and)).  Other major end uses include tungsten steels and superalloys for high-performance applications. Industrial and manufacturing growth (including oil/gas drilling, cutting tools, machine tools, and automated manufacturing) drive sustained demand.  

- **Defense and heavy industry:** Tungsten’s combination of very high density (19.3 g/cm³) and highest metal melting point (3422 °C) makes it critical for aerospace/defense.  It is widely used in heavy alloy components (kinetic energy penetrators, jet engine counterweights, radiation shielding, and high-temperature furnace parts).  For example, Reuters highlights tungsten’s importance in military and industrial applications and notes China supplies ~80% of it ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-five-new-critical-metal-exports-restricted-by-china-2025-02-04/#:~:text=1.%20,controls%20impact%20eight%20tungsten%20products)). (Modern weapons and hypersonic vehicles increasingly rely on tungsten for penetrator rods and hot-section components.)  

- **Projected tonnage:** Total US/allied annual demand is currently on the order of ~15,000 t (US alone on the order of 8–9 kt).  With steady industrial growth (~3–4%/yr) and expanded defense programs, analysts suggest demand could approach roughly **18,000–22,000 t/yr** by 2030 (primarily for hard-metal tooling and defense alloys).  (This is roughly double the current US consumption.) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/tungsten-statistics-and-information#:~:text=Tungsten%20,for%20lead%20in%20bullets%20and)) *[Projections from industry sources (Roskill/ITIA) imply continued growth; exact values are estimates.]*  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 8,000–12,000 t/yr projected supply*  

- **New mine development:** Allied production depends on several key projects.  Canada’s Mactung (Fireweed Metals) is planned to start in the late 2020s (targeting ≥2,000–3,000 t W/yr once at full capacity) ([fireweedmetals.com](https://fireweedmetals.com/fireweed-metals-announces-mineral-resources-for-the-mactung-project-the-largest-high-grade-tungsten-deposit-in-the-world/#:~:text=,WO_%7B3)).  In Europe, Barruecopardo (Saloro/EQR) is operating (~700 t W/yr) with possible expansion, and Panasqueira (Almonty) continues at similar scale.  South Korea’s Sangdong (Almonty) has resumed commissioning; once fully ramped it aims for around 8,000 t/yr of concentrate (~3,000 t W) ([www.reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/tungsten-tipped-answer-wests-critical-metals-dilemma-andy-home-2025-02-19/#:~:text=supply,The%20rising%20challenge%20for%20Western)).  In Australia, Mt Carbine Stage 2 could yield roughly 3,000–4,000 t concentrate/year ([www.nrmmrrd.qld.gov.au](https://www.nrmmrrd.qld.gov.au/mining-exploration/investors/critical-minerals/current-projects/mt-carbine#:~:text=re,around%204%2C000t%20of%20tungsten%20concentrate)) and Dolphin mine is building output.  If all these deliver as planned, new allied mines might add on the order of *8,000–12,000 t WO₃/yr* by 2030 (still below projected demand).  

- **Recycling and secondary:** Tungsten recycling (from carbide scrap, worn tools, swarf) is increasingly part of supply.  Recent reviews stress that recycling is an “essential part of the global tungsten flow” ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263436821000780#:~:text=Recycling%20is%20an%20essential%20part,of%20tungsten%20recycling%20is%20discussed)). Modern recycling can recover 70–90% of W from end-of-life hardmetal, and industry reports estimate current Western recycling around 2–3 kt/yr, potentially rising to 3.5–4.5 kt/yr by 2030 with expanded collection.  (Recycling pipelines exist in the U.S., EU, Japan, etc., but require more collection and refining capacity.)  

- **Processing capacity and imports:** Crucially, even as mining increases, supply depends on refining. Without new APT and powder plants or ferrotungsten mills in the West, most allied output will still need processing abroad.  In practice, by 2030 the majority of mined supply will likely be exported to Asia for refining unless investments create domestic facilities.  In short, projected allied mined output (8–12 kt) plus ~4 kt from recycling still leaves a supply gap if domestic processing is not developed ([pubs.usgs.gov](https://pubs.usgs.gov/publication/fs20253038/full#:~:text=,Japan%20and%20the)).  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: UV-fluorescence mapping; aerial radiometric surveys; geochemical sampling; hyperspectral imaging*  

- **Aerial radiometric surveys:** Tungsten itself is not radioactive, but many W deposits (especially skarns and greisens) contain trace U/Th pathfinder elements.  Airborne gamma-ray surveys can thus highlight U/Th anomalies over granitic intrusions, indirectly helping pinpoint scheelite/wolframite mineralization zones. For example, airborne spectroscopy has guided exploration over Yukon and Nevada tungsten prospects by detecting such pathfinders alongside structural targets.  

- **UV-fluorescence mapping:** Scheelite (CaWO₄), a major tungsten ore, bright-white to blue-white fluoresces under shortwave UV light (254 nm).  Nighttime field mapping or drone-mounted UV lamps can reveal scheelite-bearing veins and skarn zones.  Recent exploration studies (e.g. Cameroon, China) have successfully used handheld and aerial UV to trace tungsten veins – simplified by scheelite’s distinctive luminescence ([www.sciencepg.com](https://www.sciencepg.com/article/10.11648/j.earth.20241303.12#:~:text=,UV%20lamp%2C%20fluorescing%20pale%20blue)). (Wolframite is not fluorescent, so UV is mainly for scheelite.) 

- **Geological mapping and geochemistry:** Classic targeting of tungsten relies on identifying favorable rock types and alteration.  Detailed mapping locates greisenized granites, quartz veins, calc-silicate skarns, and associated minerals. Soil and rock sampling can pick up tungsten or pathfinder anomalies (Mo, Sn, Bi, As) indicative of nearby scheelite/wolframite. Stream-sediment sampling is also useful in mountain belts (e.g. Europe, Africa) where hard rock sources shed traces downstream. Integrated geochem mapping is fundamental in most recent tungsten exploration programs.  

- **Geophysical and remote sensing:** Because tungsten ores contain high-density minerals, gravity surveys can sometimes detect large massive skarns.  Magnetics and induced polarization may help map associated magnetite-scheelite zones.  More broadly, modern exploration uses satellite hyperspectral data (e.g. ASTER, Sentinel-2) and airborne hyperspectral to map alteration minerals like muscovite, chlorite, epidote, calcite, and alunite – guides for greisen and skarn environments.  For example, multispectral coregistration of ASTER bands (hydroxyl, iron oxides, carbonate indexes) can highlight propylitic/greisen alteration.  Integrating these data with field UV and geochem has proven effective: recent case studies in Asia and Africa combined Landsat/ASTER alteration mapping with UV-illuminated outcrop surveys to pinpoint scheelite-rich zones.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: open-pit/underground mining; drill-and-blast; crushing to <5 mm; SAG/ball milling*  

- **Conventional hard-rock mining:** Tungsten ores (wolframite/scheelite in veins or skarns) are typically mined by drill-and-blast. Low-grade bulk orebodies (e.g. skarns) are extracted by open-pit benches; spectacular examples include Barruecopardo (Spain) and Mt Carbine (Aus) using standard open-pit rigs and haul trucks. High-grade vein systems are often mined underground by cut-and-fill or sublevel stoping (e.g. past operations at King Island Diamond or the historic Scheelite recamps).  Modern projects like Mactung plan decline-access stopes exploiting high-grade shoots; Sangdong (Korea) uses legacy declines. Heavy LHDs and loaders move ore to surface.

- **Crushing and grinding:** Run-of-mine ore is broken down by crushers. Typical flowsheet: primary jaw/gyratory crush to ~150 mm, secondary crushing (cone or roll) to 0–10 mm, then milling (SAG mills + ball mills) to ~100–200 μm for liberation.  For example, Barruecopardo’s plant uses a primary jaw crusher, HPGR rolls, then SAG/ball mill grinding to 0.5 mm feeds.  Some plants use high-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) on very hard ores to improve energy efficiency. After crushing, ore may be stockpiled and later blended.

- **Dense pre-concentration:** Because scheelite (ρ=6.1) and wolframite (ρ≈7.5) are very dense, many circuits use gravity separation early on. Coarse crushed ore is often jigged or run through dense-media cyclones to upgrade grade (for example, Mactung’s PEA envisions jigs/HCIS centrifuges).  Typical practice: After primary crushing, material is screened (e.g. 5–75 mm) and fed to jigs or heavy-media separation. These gravity units can boost WO₃ content from raw ~0.3% up to several percent in a rough concentrate, lowering load on downstream flotation.

- **Tailings and waste:** Tungsten plants pump tailings (slurry) to engineered impoundments with water recycling. Modern designs (e.g. Sangdong) emphasize water recirculation and tailings consolidation. Some new projects (e.g. prospective sites in Patagonia) plan dry-stack tailings to minimize water issues. Existing legacy tailings (e.g. Cantung, Panasqueira) are being reviewed – these often contain 0.05–0.2% WO₃ and may be reprocessed with fine grinding to capture residual tungsten as prices justify.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: dense-media, gravity tables/jigs, magnetic separation, froth flotation*  

- **Gravity and heavy-medium separation:** Initial concentrating relies on specific gravity contrast. Crushed ore is commonly fed to dense-media cyclones or baths (e.g. using a ferrosilicon+magnetite slurry at ρ≈3.0–3.5). The dense fraction gravitates down (containing scheelite/wolframite) while gangue floats.  Gravity jigging (e.g. Kelsey or Holman jigs) and shaking tables (Wilfley tables, spirals) further upgrade the coarse material. A typical circuit might cascade jigs and spiral tables over progressively finer size fractions, boosting WO₃ grade from ~0.5% to 5–15% in rough concentrate.

- **Magnetic separation:** Wolframite ((Fe,Mn)WO₄) is paramagnetic, differentiated from non-magnetic gangue by high-intensity magnetic separation (HIMS/WHIMS, ~10,000–20,000 gauss).  Many plants (especially handling wolframite) include wet high-intensity magnetic separators on mid-sized fractions (e.g. 0.5–5 mm) to recover magnetic wolframite floats.  Scheelite (non-magnetic) bypasses this step. Magnetic circuits clean wolframite concentrates to ~65–75% WO₃ before flotation.

- **Flotation:** Froth flotation is the workhorse for fine tungsten recovery. Scheelite is floated at alkaline pH (~9–10) using fatty-acid collectors (e.g. sodium oleate, tall oil) and calcium reagents (Na₂CO₃, silicate) as depressants. Multiple stages of rougher, scavenger, and cleaner flotation concentrate CaWO₄.  Typical outputs are concentrates grading 60–70% WO₃.  Wolframite (acid float): for Fe-rich ore, flowsheets often float wolframite at mildly acidic pH using fatty acids or cationic collectors; dan rinse cleaners as needed. Combined gravity + flotation circuits can recover >90% of W in good ore.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: alkaline digestion to APT; hydrogen reduction to W powder; carbothermic reduction to FeW*  

- **Ammonium Paratungstate (APT) production:** Concentrates (~60–70% WO₃) are chemically digested in hot alkali (sodium hydroxide or carbonate, 120–150 °C) to convert scheelite/wolframite to soluble sodium tungstate.  The pregnant solution is purified (removing Mo, Cu, Fe by precipitation or ion-exchange), then treated with ammonia to precipitate ammonium paratungstate [(NH₄)₁₀W₁₂O₄₁·5H₂O].  Modern processes (e.g. Chinese and European plants) achieve >99.5% purity APT.  (Recent research also explores electrodialysis and closed-loop NH₃ recycling to reduce waste ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42864-022-00155-4#:~:text=download%2FmineralProfiles%2Ftungsten_profile,Nov%202021)).)  

- **Hydrogen reduction to tungsten metal:** Calcined APT or pure WO₃ is reduced in hydrogen furnaces to produce tungsten metal powder.  The reduction is temperature-staged (WO₃ → WO₂·₉ → WO₂ → W) typically at 700–900 °C.  Careful control yields powder from 1–10 μm.  The resulting W powder is suitable for sintering into cemented carbides or drawing into wires.  (For example, patents and reviews note multistep hydrogen reduction at ~850 °C for high-purity W powder.)  

- **Ferrotungsten smelting:** Tungsten ore or concentrates can be directly smelted with iron in electric-arc furnaces to make ferrotungsten (FeW). Typical practice: Mix concentrate (>60% WO₃) with coke/coal and scrap iron in an AC/DC arc furnace at >3,000 °C. Under CO atmosphere, the carbothermic reduction yields ferro-tungsten alloys (Fe₂W, Fe₇W₆) containing 75–82% tungsten. A slag (SiO₂, etc.) forms floating above the alloy. Modern plants rely on EAF for FeW (as in Australia’s Kronos or Germany’s Outokumpu furnaces) because it produces clean alloy; older plants may have used aluminothermic or ladle processes, but arc furnaces dominate.  

- **Carbide & alloy production:** Tungsten metal powder is carburized to tungsten carbide (1500–1600 °C) and mixed with a cobalt binder (5–15%) to make cemented carbides.  These green compacts are sintered (often at 1400–1500 °C) to near-full density.  Western advanced tooling companies (e.g. Kennametal, Sandvik, Mitsubishi) use powder metallurgy and hot isostatic pressing to control grain size.  Some specialty processes (spark plasma sintering, RHI injection molding) are used for complex shapes.  All of these depend on high-quality W powder (often from APT/H₂ reduction) as feed.

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: tailings reprocessing; hydrometallurgical extraction; water treatment; phytostabilization*  

- **Tailings reprocessing:** Historical tungsten tailings (especially from old scheelite mines) often still contain 0.05–0.2% WO₃.  Modern reprocessing grinds these tailings and runs them through improved gravity/flotation circuits to recover residual tungsten.  For example, projects at Panasqueira (Portugal) and a proposed scheme at the former Cantung (Canada) mine plan to re-mine tailings.  Recoveries of 70–90% of the residual WO₃ are achievable, turning waste into product while reducing liability.  

- **Hydrometallurgical extraction:** Contaminated tungsten spoil or low-grade ore can be leached with alkaline or acidic solutions.  Alkaline leach (Na₂CO₃/NaOH) or pressure oxidation dissolves WO₃; then solvent extraction or ion-exchange concentrates tungsten in solution.  Studies report 70–80% recovery of W from low-grade scheelite via multi-stage leaching.  For example, CaWO₄ (scheelite) can be oxidatively digested and the tungstate recovered by precipitation as APT or oxidized tungsten liquor. These methods can clean-up sites (dirt and runoff) while yielding product.  

- **Water treatment & stabilization:** Tungsten itself is low-toxicity, but tungsten ores often co-occur with As, Cd, etc. Remediation focuses on immobilizing these.  Conventional lime or alkaline precipitation (pH~10–11) removes heavy metals and arsenic from mine drainage, with most tungstate remaining soluble in residual effluent.  Tungstate rarely needs removal, but if required, adsorbents (e.g. iron oxyhydroxides, activated alumina) can polish waters.  Creating wetland or filtration cells also aids in immobilization of co-contaminants. Overall, typical tungsten mine effluent is managed with standard neutralization and metal-removal steps.  

- **Bioremediation and revegetation:** Metal-tolerant plants (e.g. certain grasses or shrubs) can stabilize tungsten waste sites. Tungsten uptake in plants is generally low (<100 mg/kg), so plants serve to anchor soils rather than phytoextract.  For example, *Agrostis* species or *Betula nana* have been trialed on tailings, after adding lime and nutrients. Biological soil crusts and mycorrhizal microbes can also help. The main goal is dust and erosion control.  Over decades, such phytostabilization provides passive remediation of old tungsten mine dumps.
