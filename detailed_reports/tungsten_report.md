## Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: APT/powder plants; hydrogen reduction furnaces; ferrotungsten smelters*

The critical bottleneck is **downstream processing** (chemical refining) of tungsten concentrate. Even with new Western mines, the lack of domestic facilities to convert raw ore into saleable tungsten products (like ammonium paratungstate and tungsten metal powders) stymies supply. Nearly all technology and capacity for these steps resides in China; the West has only a handful of small scrap recyclers. In effect, without a home-grown APT/powder plant or FeW smelter, new ore cannot be economically utilized. Expert commentary notes that "controls on APT and tungsten carbide could be the most affected due to the limited availability of alternatives outside China" ([Reuters, 2024](https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/shares-china-tungsten-producers-rally-beijings-latest-export-curbs-2024)). Thus, **purification/refining technology** (APT plants, hydrogen-reduction furnaces, etc.) is the bottleneck.

**Key Bottleneck Summary:** Despite planned allied mining projects, the failure point is processing, not ore. The U.S. and partners lack commercial facilities (autoclave digesters, hydrogen-reduction for WO₃, etc.) to turn concentrate into tungsten metal or carbide; virtually all high-purity W production is in China. Without domestic APT/powder capacity, even sizable Western mine output would depend on foreign (primarily Chinese) refineries. In short, advanced refinement of tungsten concentrate is the single chokepoint limiting US/allied production.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~3,000 tons/year total allied production*

• **United States (US):** 0 t. The US has had no active tungsten mines since 2018 when the last producer in California ceased operations. There are no operating US sources, and historic producers (e.g., high-grade scheelite deposits) have been idled. The US relies entirely on imports (mostly finished products or concentrates) ([USGS, 2024](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/tungsten-statistics-and-information)).

• **Canada:** 0 t. Historic Canadian mines (Cantung, NWT) closed by 2015. Canada's known deposits (e.g., Cantung and the Mactung skarn) are under development, but as of 2024 no production. The Mactung deposit (Yukon–NWT border) has ~33,000 t WO₃ indicated resource at 0.88% WO₃, making it one of the world's largest high-grade tungsten deposits, but it remains in pre-production. Thus Canadian domestic output remains nil pending new mine startups.

• **Australia:** ~400-500 t in 2024. Australia has several tungsten producers. EQ Resources' Mount Carbine mine (Queensland) and King Island Scheelite's Dolphin mine (Tasmania) account for most output. Production has been intermittent, with several mines reopening in recent years as tungsten prices improved.

• **European Union (EU):** ~3,000 t. Key EU producers in 2024 were Austria (~1,000 t), Spain (~900 t), and Portugal (~600 t). Austria's Wolfram Bergbau mine at Mittersill is Western Europe's only continuously operating tungsten mine. Spain's Barruecopardo (operated by Ormonde Mining/Orvana) resumed production in 2019, and Portugal's Panasqueira mine (owned by Almonty Industries) continues century-old operations. Reserve bases are modest but current production provides critical non-Chinese supply.

• **Other Allies (Norway, Iceland, Japan, South Korea):** ~500 t. South Korea's Sangdong mine (Almonty Industries) restarted in 2023 after being closed since 1992, with production ramping up. Japan and Norway import tungsten concentrates/metals and have no domestic ore production, though Japan maintains significant tungsten metallurgy capacity using imported feedstock.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 18,000-22,000 tons/year projected demand*

• **Growth sectors:** Cemented carbide and superalloys dominate tungsten demand. USGS notes the largest end use is tungsten carbide in hard-metal tools, accounting for approximately 60% of consumption. In 2023, US consumption was approximately 8,500 t with ~5,100 t in cemented carbides. Demand is expected to grow 3-4% annually in manufacturing (cutting/drilling tools) and aerospace/defense (heavy alloy counterweights, penetrators) through 2030.

• **Defense and heavy industry:** Tungsten heavy alloys are critical for kinetic penetrators, rocket nozzles, and radiation shielding. Modern military applications and infrastructure development suggest rising strategic demand, especially for US/NATO forces. Tungsten's unique properties (highest melting point at 3,422°C, density of 19.3 g/cm³) drive its use in hypersonic vehicle components and advanced munitions, sectors projected to expand significantly.

• **Projected tonnage:** Based on current consumption patterns and growth projections, US consumption alone could reach 10,000-12,000 t by 2030. Total allied consumption (US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Australia) currently stands at approximately 15,000 t annually. With projected 3-4% annual growth in industrial activity and defense spending, US/allies demand could reach **18,000-22,000 t** by 2030, with the majority in hard-metal tooling and defense applications.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 8,000-12,000 tons/year projected supply*

• **New mine development:** Projected allied supply hinges on startup of key projects outside China. Canada's Mactung project (Fireweed Metals) targets production by 2028; its resource could yield 2,000-3,000 tonnes WO₃ per year once operational. In Europe, Barruecopardo (Spain) is producing ~700 t W annually with expansion potential. South Korea's Sangdong mine is ramping to 3,000 t/year capacity. Australia's reopened mines could collectively supply ~1,000 t. **If all projects achieve targets**, combined domestic/projected allied output might reach **8,000-12,000 t/year** by 2030 (still below total demand).

• **Recycling and secondary supply:** Allies are investing in recycling tungsten-bearing scrap (e.g., end-of-life carbide tools, grinding swarf). Recycling can recover 30-40% of tungsten from scrap through chemical and pyrometallurgical processes. Current Western recycling capacity is estimated at 2,000-3,000 t/year and could reach **3,500-4,500 t/year** by 2030 with expanded collection and processing infrastructure.

• **Processing capacity and imports:** Even with mining additions, allied tungsten processing (to powders, APT, FeW) remains severely limited. Meaningful "domestic supply" in 2030 will require either new processing facilities or continued reliance on imports from China. In summary, by 2030 US/allied primary supply is expected to reach 8,000-12,000 tonnes per year from new allied mines, with an additional 3,500-4,500 tonnes from recycling.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: UV-fluorescence mapping; aerial radiometric surveys; geochemical sampling; hyperspectral imaging*

• **Aerial Radiometric Surveys:** Though tungsten minerals are not inherently radioactive, tungsten often occurs in skarns or greisens with uranium/thorium pathfinders. Airborne gamma-ray surveys can highlight U/Th anomalies in granitic terrains, indirectly pointing to possible tungsten-bearing skarn systems (e.g., Canada's Yukon, Nevada).

• **UV-Fluorescence Mapping:** Scheelite (CaWO₄), a major tungsten ore, fluoresces bright blue-white under shortwave ultraviolet light (254 nm). Field or drone-mounted UV lamps can illuminate scheelite-bearing veins at night. Exploration crews use UV surveys to trace scheelite in quartz veins, as documented in recent African exploration programs.

• **Geological Mapping and Geochemistry:** Targeting host environments – such as granitic intrusions with greisen alteration or contact skarns – guides discovery. Detailed mapping identifies quartz veins, calc-silicate zones and hydrothermal alteration. Geochemical soil and rock sampling can detect tungsten or associated pathfinder elements (Mo, Sn, Bi, As) anomalies above mineralization. Stream-sediment sampling has successfully outlined hard-rock W targets in multiple jurisdictions.

• **Geophysical Surveys:** High-density tungsten minerals can produce minor gravity anomalies if deposits are sufficiently large. Magnetometer surveys can highlight magnetite-rich skarns often spatially associated with scheelite. Induced polarization (IP) may detect disseminated sulfides that occur with tungsten. Modern approaches use hyperspectral and satellite (Sentinel-2, ASTER) data to map alteration minerals (muscovite, chlorite, epidote) typical of tungsten systems.

• **Techniques Integration:** Modern exploration combines multiple techniques. For example, analysts apply multispectral satellite imagery processing along with UV survey data and geochemical sampling to efficiently locate scheelite-rich veins, demonstrating integrated discovery workflows for tungsten.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: open-pit/underground mining; drill-and-blast; crushing to <5mm; SAG/ball milling*

• **Conventional Hard-Rock Mining:** Tungsten ores (wolframite/scheelite veins and skarns) are mined by drill-and-blast methods. Barruecopardo (Spain) uses standard open-pit benches with drilling, blasting and load-haul-dump to remove ore. High-grade veins employ underground methods such as cut-and-fill or sublevel stoping to selectively mine steep ore shoots. Large-tonnage projects (e.g., Mactung) plan underground decline and stope operations. Heavy excavators, LHDs and haul trucks move ore to surface.

• **Ore Crushing and Grinding:** Primary crushers (jaw, gyratory) reduce run-of-mine rock to <150 mm. Secondary crushing (cone crushers or HPGR) and SAG/ball mills grind ore typically to <200 μm for liberation. Barruecopardo's plant crushes ore to 0-5 mm before concentration. High-pressure grinding rolls (HPGR) are increasingly used to improve energy efficiency on hard tungsten ores.

• **Gravitational Pre-concentration:** Given tungsten minerals' high specific gravity (scheelite: 6.1; wolframite: 7.5), dense-media separation is employed early. Tungsten ore is often pre-concentrated via jigs, spirals or shaking tables immediately after crushing. These gravity units recover coarse tungsten minerals before flotation, achieving initial upgrading from 0.3-0.5% WO₃ to 2-5% WO₃.

• **Mine Dewatering and Tailings:** Most operations pump tailings as slurry to engineered impoundments with water recycling. Some modern projects (e.g., Sangdong, South Korea) are evaluating dry-stack tailings to reduce water consumption and environmental footprint. Historical tailings are increasingly viewed as potential resources for reprocessing.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: dense-media separation; gravity tables/jigs; magnetic separation; froth flotation*

• **Dense-Media Separation:** Early-stage separation uses heavy-liquid cyclones or baths. A ferrosilicon-magnetite suspension provides a medium (ρ=3.0-3.5 g/cm³) that separates dense scheelite/wolframite from lighter gangue minerals. This produces a tungsten-rich rougher concentrate and waste tailings.

• **Gravity Tables and Jigs:** Following dense media separation, gravity tables (Wilfley, Holman) and jigs enhance grade. These devices exploit differences in mineral density and particle behavior in water films. They are especially effective for coarse scheelite (0.5-3 mm). Many plants also use spiral concentrators for finer fractions (0.1-0.5 mm). Multiple stages can upgrade concentrates from 5% to 20-30% WO₃.

• **Magnetic Separation:** Wolframite ((Fe,Mn)WO₄) is weakly magnetic; high-intensity magnetic separators (HIMS/WHIMS) at 10,000-20,000 gauss can separate it from non-magnetic gangue. Magnetic separation is routine in wolframite circuits. Scheelite (non-magnetic) requires alternative methods, typically flotation.

• **Flotation:** Froth flotation recovers fine-grained tungsten minerals. For scheelite, collectors (fatty acids, sodium oleate) and modifiers (sodium silicate, sodium carbonate) selectively float CaWO₄ from silicates and carbonates at pH 9-10. Multiple cleaning stages upgrade rougher concentrates to final products of 60-70% WO₃. Wolframite flotation uses different reagent schemes at acidic pH.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: alkaline digestion to APT; hydrogen reduction to metal; carbothermic reduction to ferrotungsten*

• **Ammonium Paratungstate (APT) Process:** Concentrates (60-70% WO₃) undergo alkaline digestion with sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate at 110-150°C, converting tungsten minerals to soluble sodium tungstate. After purification by precipitation and ion exchange, ammonia is added to crystallize ammonium paratungstate ((NH₄)₁₀W₁₂O₄₁·5H₂O). APT serves as the primary traded intermediate, with >99.5% purity achievable.

• **Hydrogen Reduction:** Calcined APT or tungsten oxide (WO₃) undergoes staged reduction in hydrogen atmosphere at 700-900°C to produce tungsten metal powder. The process follows: WO₃ → WO₂.₉ → WO₂ → W, with careful temperature control to manage particle size. Product tungsten powder (1-10 μm) feeds carbide and alloy production.

• **Ferrotungsten Smelting:** For steel alloying applications, tungsten concentrates are carbothermically reduced with iron sources in electric arc furnaces at >3,000°C. The reaction: 2FeWO₄ + 2Fe + 4C → 2Fe₂W + 4CO produces ferrotungsten alloys (75-85% W). Western capacity is limited to a few facilities in Europe and Japan.

• **Carbide & Alloy Fabrication:** Tungsten metal powder is carburized at 1,400-1,600°C (W + C → WC) then mixed with cobalt binder and sintered at 1,350-1,500°C to produce cemented carbides. Advanced techniques include spark plasma sintering and hot isostatic pressing for specialized applications. Western firms (Kennametal, Sandvik, Element Six) dominate high-end carbide tool manufacture but rely on imported tungsten inputs.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: tailings reprocessing; hydrometallurgical extraction; water treatment; phytostabilization*

• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Historical tungsten mine wastes often contain 0.05-0.2% WO₃, making reprocessing economically viable at current prices. Modern operations re-grind tailings and use enhanced gravity separation and flotation to extract residual tungsten. This simultaneously reduces environmental liabilities and recovers valuable metal. Projects at Panasqueira (Portugal) and planned work at Cantung (Canada) exemplify this approach.

• **Hydrometallurgical Extraction:** Advanced leaching methods can remediate contaminated sites while recovering tungsten. Alkaline leaching with sodium carbonate/hydroxide or pressure oxidation can solubilize tungsten from low-grade materials. Ion exchange or solvent extraction then recovers tungsten from pregnant solutions. Recovery rates of 70-85% are achievable from tailings containing >0.1% WO₃.

• **Water Treatment & Stabilization:** Mine water treatment focuses on removing arsenic and heavy metals often associated with tungsten deposits. Lime precipitation at pH 10-11 removes most dissolved metals. Tungstate itself has low toxicity and limited mobility at neutral pH. Specialized adsorbents (activated alumina, iron hydroxides) can remove trace tungstate if required.

• **Bioremediation and Revegetation:** Phytostabilization using metal-tolerant plants prevents erosion of tungsten-bearing tailings. Species like *Agrostis* grasses and *Betula* (birch) trees can establish on tungsten mine wastes after pH adjustment and nutrient addition. While tungsten uptake by plants is minimal (<100 mg/kg dry weight), vegetation cover reduces dust and water erosion, limiting contaminant spread.
