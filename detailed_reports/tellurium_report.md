## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Copper refinery Te recovery circuits; anode slime processing; chlorination/roasting infrastructure*

The principal bottleneck is **Te recovery capability in copper refining**. Today's copper leaching/electrorefining plants are optimized for Cu and do not capture all contained Te. As DOE notes, existing refineries often have not deployed Te recovery units. The Kennecott example shows it is feasible, but most allied refineries still send anode slimes to tailings. Without retrofitting these facilities with Te extraction processes (chlorination, roasting, dedicated electrolytic cells, etc.), significant Te remains lost. In practice, this limits allied Te output to the ~150-160 t/yr range (Kennecott ~20 t + existing byproduct streams) despite much higher theoretical potential. In short, lack of co-product recovery tech in the copper refining chain seriously constrains US/allied Te supply.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)
Tellurium is virtually never mined directly; almost all supply comes as **byproduct of copper/gold refining**. The bottleneck is that many allied refineries lack efficient Te recovery steps. For example, only Rio Tinto's Kennecott has a dedicated 20 t/yr Te circuit, while other plants omit this step. Thus, despite rising demand, US/allied Te production is capped by **processing technology**, not geology. Expanding extraction will require retrofitting refineries to capture the Te in anode slimes.

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: ~155-160 tons/year total allied production*

• **United States:** Historically no active tellurium (Te) mines exist and domestic output was essentially zero. In 2022, Rio Tinto commissioned a Te recovery circuit at its Kennecott (Utah) copper refinery (~20 t/yr), making it one of only two U.S. Te producers. Prior to that start-up, U.S. "production" was entirely byproduct recovery from imported or recycled sources. Thus current U.S. mine production remains ≈0 t, with only the Kennecott stream adding ~20 t/yr.

• **Canada:** Canadian refiners produced on the order of 10-15 t in recent years. Note that the Kidd Creek operation closed in 2022, reducing Canadian capacity. Columbia University data indicate Canada accounted for ~4.1% of world Te output in 2022. With global production at ~580 t (USGS 2023), this suggests ~24 t/yr, though actual production may be lower post-Kidd Creek closure. Canada has no Te mines; all domestic output is recovered from copper/gold processing and electronic scrap.

• **Japan:** Japan remains a major Te source. In 2022 it supplied ~21.45% of world Te production according to Columbia University data. Taking global output ~580 t, that implies ~124 t/yr from Japanese refiners. Pan Pacific Copper's Saganoseki smelter and JX Nippon Mining's operations historically process Te-bearing copper concentrates. Japan has no primary Te mines; all supply is byproduct recovery.

• **European Union (e.g. Sweden, Belgium):** The EU has no Te mines. Sweden produced ~5.65% of world Te in 2022 (≈33 t/yr based on 580 t global). Belgium's Umicore also recovers Te from recycling operations. Other EU nations have negligible Te output. EU production is entirely from metallurgical slimes and recycled sources.

• **Australia, Norway, Iceland:** These allies have no reported Te production. Australia's critical-minerals strategy notes Te as an "identified mineral resource" (trace in copper/nickel ores), but no operating Te recovery. Likewise Norway/Iceland have no mine or refinery output.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 400-600 tons/year projected by 2030*

• **CdTe Photovoltaics:** The largest demand sector by far is cadmium-telluride (CdTe) solar modules. Te demand for CdTe cells is approximately 90-100 g per kW of modules at present. With U.S./allied CdTe capacity expanding (First Solar planning 10.5 GW/yr U.S. capacity by 2025, plus facilities in India and Vietnam), Te consumption will rise. Global solar capacity is projected to exceed 5,400 GW by 2030 (IEA). If CdTe maintains even 3-5% market share, allied demand could reach 200-300 metric tons annually for solar alone.

• **Thermoelectric Devices:** Advanced thermoelectric materials (e.g., bismuth telluride, lead telluride) use significant Te. Argus Media (2022) estimated ~30% of Te use is in thermoelectrics. US and allied research in waste heat recovery and cooling applications suggests this fraction will grow, requiring 50-100 tonnes more by 2030.

• **Metallurgical Alloys and Glass:** Te is added to specialty steels/aluminum alloys (improves machinability, grain refinement) and optical glasses. This accounts for roughly 10-15% of Te demand. Allied steelmaking and specialty glass industries will therefore need on the order of 40-60 t/yr by 2030.

• **Electronics/Sensors:** Te compounds (CdTe, HgCdTe, CdZnTe) are used in infrared detectors, medical imaging and X-ray sensors. Growth in the semiconductor and medical-imaging sectors (EU, US, Japan) may add ~10% of Te demand by 2030. Experimental tellurium-based batteries remain in early research phases.

• **Total Allied Demand Estimate:** Summing these, U.S. & allied demand by 2030 is likely on the order of **400-600 metric tons per year**. For context, global demand was ~580 t/yr in 2022 (USGS); projected PV growth and new technologies imply allied demand could approach 50-60% of global consumption by 2030.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: 150-200 tons/year domestic production capacity*

• **Domestic Production Capacity:** Even with forecast increases, allied domestic Te "mined" or refined output will remain limited. By 2030, the largest continuous source is still Rio Tinto's Kennecott (20 t/yr). Canada can sustain ~10-15 t/yr from remaining copper-gold refineries (post-Kidd Creek closure). Sweden about 33 t/yr. Japan ~124 t/yr from its smelters. Belgium (Umicore) ~10-15 t/yr from recycling. Summing these gives roughly 150-200 t/yr across all allies. New projects are exploration-stage only. Thus **allied domestic production** by 2030 might only be on the order of 150-200 t/yr.

• **Recycling and Scraps:** Allied supply can be augmented by recycling. First Solar (US) and others recover >95% of Te from end-of-life CdTe modules; this returns several tons each year to the supply pool. Other electronics and metallurgical scrap recycling could contribute additional tens of tons. However, recycling alone cannot fill the multi-hundred tonne gap given the long lifespan of solar panels (25+ years).

• **Imports:** The balance of allied Te needs (~200-400 t/yr) will have to come from imports. China (by far the largest Te producer/exporter, ~290 t/yr or 50% of global production) and others (Russia, Kazakhstan) currently fill this role. By 2030, unless more allied output comes online, the U.S. and other allies will remain highly import-dependent.

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Copper-gold deposit analysis; anode slime assaying; hyperspectral imaging; tailings reprocessing*

• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Exploration targets known Te-bearing systems. Geologists map porphyry-Cu and epithermal gold fields where telluride minerals (calaverite, sylvanite, hessite) occur. Stream-sediment and soil sampling for Te and pathfinder elements (Bi, Sb, Se, Au) can highlight anomalies in favorable host lithologies. Te was discovered at Dashuigou (China) during gold exploration.

• **Geophysical Surveys:** While Te has no direct geophysical signature, airborne and ground geophysics (magnetics, induced-polarization, gravity) delineate the underlying structures. Identifying porphyry intrusions or epithermal alteration zones informs where Te-bearing Cu/Au mineralization might exist. High-resolution hyperspectral sensors can detect alteration minerals (e.g., alunite, silica) typical of epithermal deposits.

• **Data Integration/ML:** Modern discovery uses GIS and machine-learning on multivariate datasets (geology, geochemistry, geophysics). Combining known Te occurrences with satellite geology and drill-core assays helps vector toward blind deposits.

• **Re-examination of By-product Deposits:** Te often occurs in trace amounts. Reprocessing historic copper-gold tailings or analyzing preexisting ore samples for Te using ICP-MS can identify overlooked Te-rich sources (as in Sweden's Boliden operations).

• **Indicator Mineral Techniques:** Bismuth tellurides and other Te-bearing minerals in stream sediments can be exploited. However, Te's extreme scarcity (1-5 ppb in Earth's crust per USGS) makes direct detection challenging; thus exploration usually piggybacks on established Cu-Au prospects.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Copper anode slime roasting; chlorination circuits; vacuum distillation; hydrometallurgical leaching*

• **Copper Electrorefinery Slime Processing:** The dominant extraction route. In electrolytic copper refining, Te accumulates in insoluble anode slimes. Specialized circuits (as at Rio's Kennecott) then treat these slimes. Kennecott's new circuit processes slimes to yield ~20 t/yr of granular Te. Many refineries (in Canada, Japan, etc.) similarly roast or chlorinate slimes to separate Te/Se fractions. This extraction is a byproduct adaptation of standard Cu refining.

• **Pyrometallurgy of Slimes:** Traditional methods (Pan Pacific Copper's Saganoseki smelter, JX Nippon operations) roast anode slimes; Te volatilizes as TeO₂ or sulfur compounds, then condenses. Modern plants often use chlorination: slimes are treated with chlorine gas to convert Te to TeCl₄ vapors, which are then hydrolyzed to TeO₂.

• **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** Alternative approaches dissolve Te from refractory materials. Strong oxidizing acid leach (HNO₃/H₂SO₄) can strip Te from slimes into solution as tellurous acid, which is then precipitated by reducing agents or by pH adjustment. Ion-exchange resins or solvent extraction can separate Te from Se and other metals in such solutions.

• **Direct Mineral Processing:** Where Te occurs in telluride ores, conventional flotation can concentrate Au-Te minerals. Subsequent processing (roasting & acid leach or direct smelting) separates Te. Japanese smelters historically used such approaches on high-Te concentrates.

• **Thermal Refining:** Final steps often involve reductive smelting. TeO₂ (from roasting slimes) is mixed with reductants (e.g., carbon or H₂) and heated in an inert atmosphere to yield metallic Te (mp ~450°C). Advanced versions use vacuum distillation to achieve high purity.

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Selective precipitation; solvent extraction; ion exchange; fractional crystallization*

• **Precipitation & Redox Control:** In electrolytic slimes processing, Te is separated from selenium and precious metals by controlled oxidation/reduction. After leaching, Te⁴⁺ is precipitated by reducing it to elemental Te with agents like SO₂. Careful pH control allows Te(IV) to precipitate while Se and others remain in solution. Such selective chemistry yields Te sludges that are filtered and smelted to metal.

• **Solvent Extraction / Ion Exchange:** Alkaline tellurite (Na₂TeO₃) or tellurate (Na₂TeO₄) solutions are compatible with anion-exchange resins or solvent-extractant carriers (e.g., tributyl phosphate) to separate Te from competing anions. After loading onto resin, Te is eluted and converted to TeO₂. This method is practiced in some specialty refineries for ultra-pure Te production.

• **Fractional Distillation:** Impure Te metal or TeO₂ is purified via distillation. Under reduced pressure at 500-600°C, Te compounds vaporize and re-condense in a cooler zone, leaving impurities behind. These methods achieve 4N-5N (99.99-99.999%) Te metal for semiconductor use.

• **Cementation Methods:** Some refineries use copper cementation to recover Te from solution. Metallic copper powder is added to Te-bearing solutions, causing Te to precipitate as metal while copper dissolves. This simple method is effective for dilute streams.

• **Selective Crystallization:** Tellurate salts (e.g., K₂TeO₄) have low solubility at certain temperatures/pH. Refiners can crystallize these salts out of solution, further separating Te from more soluble elements.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Zone refining; vacuum distillation; electrolytic refining; chemical recrystallization*

• **Zone Refining and Solidification:** High-purity Te for electronics is often produced by zone melting. A molten zone is passed through a Te ingot; impurities concentrate in the molten zone and are swept to one end. Multiple passes can yield 99.9999% Te (used in infrared detectors).

• **Vacuum Distillation:** Ultra-pure Te metal is obtained by repeated vacuum distillation at 500-600°C. Crude Te metal is heated in a vacuum; Te vapor condenses in a cooler portion of the apparatus. Newer systems using graphite-lined chambers minimize contamination.

• **Electrolytic Refining:** Te metal can be electrorefined. A crude Te anode is dissolved in an alkaline electrolyte and redeposited on cathodes. This removes residual metals (Bi, Pb, Se). Canada's 5N Plus uses proprietary electrorefining to achieve "5N" Te for CdTe PV.

• **Chemical Recrystallization:** TeO₂ is dissolved in alkaline media and re-precipitated to remove impurities. Dissolving crude Te in NaOH and re-crystallizing sodium tellurite yields a cleaner intermediate. Such chemical cycling, followed by reduction with SO₂, can improve purity.

• **Hydride Generation:** Advanced facilities use hydrogen reduction of TeO₂ at 400-500°C to produce high-purity Te metal. The H₂TeO₃ intermediate can be purified by crystallization before reduction.

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: CdTe module recycling; tailings reprocessing; wastewater precipitation; emissions scrubbing*

• **PV Module Recycling:** Expanding end-of-life CdTe PV recycling is essential. First Solar's process (used in US and Malaysia) mechanically shreds and chemically leaches Cd and Te from modules, recovering >95% of each. This not only recaptures critical Te but also avoids landfill of toxic Cd. Research is ongoing on improved solvents and direct material reuse.

• **Copper Mine Tailings Treatment:** Since Te largely ends up in Cu tailings if unrecovered, some operations are piloting tailings reprocessing. Acid or bio-leaching of historic Cu tailings can extract residual Te (along with Cu/Au). This both remediates unstable dumps and supplies Te. Pilot projects in Chile and Peru have demonstrated technical feasibility.

• **Wastewater Scrubbing:** Refinery effluents containing Te (as tellurite) are treated by precipitation. Neutralization with ferric sulfate or lime converts soluble Te to insoluble compounds, which are filtered. Modern smelters include closed-loop scrubbers that capture Se/Te as solid residues, minimizing environmental release.

• **Stabilization of Byproducts:** Captured Te-bearing sludges and slags must be stabilized. Portland cement or polymer encapsulation prevents Te leaching from waste dumps. The reduced waste volume (e.g., Kennecott's circuit prevents 20 t/yr of Te from entering tailings) simplifies long-term management.

• **Emissions Control:** Baghouse filters and wet scrubbers in smelters capture any volatilized Te/Se before stack release. Captured emissions are processed like slimes. Overall, modern Te production is designed to minimize pollution by recycling intermediate wastes.
