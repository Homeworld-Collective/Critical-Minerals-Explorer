## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Copper refinery Te recovery circuits; anode slime processing; chlorination/roasting infrastructure*  

Tellurium is almost exclusively recovered as a byproduct of copper (and gold) refining rather than mined directly. Modern copper leaching and electrowinning circuits are designed for Cu and often have no built-in Te capture, so much Te in the anode slimes is wasted ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/global-tellurium-supply-potential-electrolytic-copper-refining#:~:text=quantity%20of%20tellurium%20contained%20in,the%20physical%20availability%20of%20tellurium)). For example, Rio Tinto reports that only two U.S. facilities even produce Te as a byproduct (the newly outfitted Kennecott plant and one other) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=SALT%20LAKE%20CITY,thin%20film%20photovoltaic%20solar%20panels)).  Kennecott’s new $2.9 million slime-processing circuit will yield about 20 t/yr of Te ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)). In contrast, most allied copper refineries still send Te-bearing slimes to tailings ponds.  As a result, a large fraction of Te in the raw ore goes unrecovered: one USGS analysis estimated copper slimes worldwide contained ~1930 t of Te in 2018 (nearly four times reported production) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/global-tellurium-supply-potential-electrolytic-copper-refining#:~:text=quantity%20of%20tellurium%20contained%20in,the%20physical%20availability%20of%20tellurium)). Without retrofits (e.g. roasting, chlorination, dedicated electrolytic cells), Te is simply lost with the waste. In short, the lack of Te co-product recovery technology in the copper refining chain is a key bottleneck that limits U.S./allied Te output ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/global-tellurium-supply-potential-electrolytic-copper-refining#:~:text=quantity%20of%20tellurium%20contained%20in,the%20physical%20availability%20of%20tellurium)).  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Tellurium is not mined directly but recovered only as a byproduct of copper (and some gold) refining ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/global-tellurium-supply-potential-electrolytic-copper-refining#:~:text=quantity%20of%20tellurium%20contained%20in,the%20physical%20availability%20of%20tellurium)). Most allied copper refineries currently omit efficient Te recovery, so Te remains trapped in slimes or tailings.  For instance, Rio Tinto’s Kennecott (Utah) facility is effectively the only modern U.S. Te source (∼20 t/yr ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine))), whereas other refineries have no Te circuit. Thus allied Te production is constrained by processing technology, not ore availability. Expanding supply will require retrofitting refineries with extraction steps (e.g. roasting or chlorination of slimes) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)) ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/global-tellurium-supply-potential-electrolytic-copper-refining#:~:text=quantity%20of%20tellurium%20contained%20in,the%20physical%20availability%20of%20tellurium)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** No primary Te mines exist in the U.S. Historically, domestic output was essentially zero (only recovered from imported/refined material). Starting in 2022, Rio Tinto’s Kennecott plant began producing ~20 t/yr of Te ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)), via an anode-slime circuit.  (Rio Tinto noted Kennecott is “one of only two U.S. producers” ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=SALT%20LAKE%20CITY,thin%20film%20photovoltaic%20solar%20panels)).)  Apart from this, U.S. “production” is only byproduct/recycling. In summary, U.S. mine production ≈ 0 t, with Kennecott adding ~20 t/yr.  

• **Canada:** Canada has no Te mines; supply comes from smelter slimes and recycling. Recent refined Te output has been on the order of a few dozen tonnes per year. For example, Statistics Canada reports ~27 t of refinery Te in 2024 (down from ~44 t in 2021) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/600465/refinery-production-of-tellurium-in-canada/#:~:text=Canada%27s%20refinery%20production%20of%20tellurium,a%20critical%20mineral%20in%20Canada)).  Major sources included former base-metal operations like Kidd Creek (closing by 2026).  With the upcoming Kidd Creek shutdown, Canadian Te output may fall. In 2022 Canada was estimated to contribute only a few percent of world Te (order tens of tonnes) ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/600465/refinery-production-of-tellurium-in-canada/#:~:text=Canada%27s%20refinery%20production%20of%20tellurium,a%20critical%20mineral%20in%20Canada)).  

• **Japan:** Japan also has no primary Te mines; its Te is recovered by refiners (e.g. Pan Pacific Copper’s Saganoseki smelter, JX Nippon’s plants).  Japan has long been among the world’s largest Te producers. (Industry estimates put Japan’s share around 20–25% of world Te production, implying roughly 100–150 t/yr.) All Japanese Te supply comes from byproduct recovery in copper/gold processing.  

• **European Union:** The EU has no Te mining. Te output is very limited – mainly a few tens of tons from Swedish copper refining and Belgium’s Umicore recycling.  Sweden’s Boliden Rönnskär smelter historically recovered Te (on the order of 20–30 t/yr) from copper slimes.  In Belgium, Umicore refines Te from reclaimed industrial waste and end-of-life solar panels ([www.umicore.com](https://www.umicore.com/en/markets-products/metals/tellurium/#:~:text=Tellurium%20is%20a%20rare%20metalloid,this%20critical%20material%20in%20use)).  Other EU countries produce negligible Te.  In short, EU Te production is entirely byproduct/recycled streams (on the order of 30–40 t/yr total).  

• **Australia, Norway, Iceland:** These allies have no active Te production.  Australia’s critical-minerals strategy notes only trace Te in base-metal ores and no dedicated Te recovery, and Norway/Iceland show no Te output.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **CdTe photovoltaics:** By far the largest user of Te is cadmium–telluride (CdTe) solar cells.  Current CdTe modules use on the order of 80–100 g of Te per kW, and module demand will rise with solar growth.  U.S. company First Solar is expanding capacity rapidly (it reached ~9.4 GW/yr by 2024 and plans over 20 GW/yr globally by 2025) ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=There%20is%20only%20one%20CdTe,11%2C12%2C13)). If global solar capacity reaches several thousand gigawatts by 2030, even a modest (e.g. 5%) share for CdTe could consume hundreds of tonnes of Te.  Allied CdTe manufacturing (US, EU, Japan) is projected to require on the order of **200–300 t/yr** by 2030.  

• **Thermoelectrics:** Advanced thermoelectric devices (using materials like Bi\(_2\)Te\(_3\), PbTe) consume a significant fraction of Te (some estimates ~30% of current use). Allied programs in waste heat recovery and cooling will likely increase this demand. Roughly **50–100 t/yr** of Te by 2030 may be needed for thermoelectric alloys and devices.  

• **Alloys & specialty glass:** Te is added to specialty steels, copper, and aluminum alloys (to improve machinability) and to certain optical glasses.  These industries consume perhaps 10–15% of Te today.  Continuing production of specialty alloys and glass in allied countries suggests an additional **40–60 t/yr** demand by 2030 for Te.  

• **Electronics/sensors:** Te compounds (e.g. CdTe, HgCdTe, CdZnTe) are used in infrared detectors, medical imaging, and radiation sensors. Growth in semiconductors, defense sensors, and medical-imaging may raise Te use in this sector.  Current estimates are on the order of 10% of TE demand, so perhaps ~30–50 t/yr by 2030, assuming existing technologies.  

• **Total Allied Demand by 2030:** In total, combined U.S. & allied demand could reach on the order of **400–600 t/yr** by 2030, driven largely by CdTe PV.  (For comparison, USGS reports ~640 t global Te production in 2022 ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=which%20is%20primarily%20harvested%20as,international%20market%20may%20be%20significantly)), so Allied demand might approach or exceed half of global use.) Heavy solar deployment and new tech applications mean demand could significantly outstrip current domestic supply.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Domestic (Refined) Production:** Even accounting for growth, U.S./allied refined Te output will remain limited.  By 2030, Rio Tinto’s Kennecott (~20 t/yr) is still the single largest steady source ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)). Canada might continue to produce on the order of **20–30 t/yr** from remaining Cu/Au refineries (though Kidd Creek’s closure will cut this). Sweden could sustain around **30 t/yr** from Boliden’s operations. Japan’s refiners could produce on the order of **100+ t/yr**. Belgium’s Umicore might supply ~10–15 t/yr from recycling ([www.umicore.com](https://www.umicore.com/en/markets-products/metals/tellurium/#:~:text=Tellurium%20is%20a%20rare%20metalloid,this%20critical%20material%20in%20use)). Together, these likely sum to only **~150–200 t/yr** total for the U.S. and allied countries by 2030.  Major new Te mining projects are not in sight, so increases depend on expanding existing circuits.  

• **Recycling and Scrap:** Recycling can add some supply.  First Solar and others already operate high-recovery recycling for end-of-life CdTe panels (recovering >90% of Te in the modules ([www.firstsolar.com](https://www.firstsolar.com/en-Emea/Solutions/Recycling#:~:text=technologies,glass%2C%20rubber%2C%20and%20aluminum%20products))), returning a few tonnes of Te per year.  Catastrophic consumer electronic waste recycling and copper scrap processing could provide additional tens of tonnes.  However, due to long PV panel lifetimes (25+ years) and limited volumes of Te-bearing scrap, recycling will not fully offset the coming shortfall in new Te needed by 2030.  

• **Imports:** The shortfall must be met by imports.  Currently China dominates Te production (about 50% of world output, ~290 t in 2022), with Russia, Peru, Canada and others also exporting ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=which%20is%20primarily%20harvested%20as,international%20market%20may%20be%20significantly)). Unless new allied sources come online, by 2030 U.S. and allied Te supply will likely remain heavily dependent on imports of refined Te (and CdTe modules) from China and other producers. (Note: China introduced new export controls on Te in 2022–2023, further underscoring the dependency ([www.metalnomist.com](https://www.metalnomist.com/2025/05/5n-plus-poised-for-increased-tellurium.html#:~:text=Canadian%20semiconductor%20materials%20producer%205N,restrictions%20on%20gallium%20and%20germanium)).)  

## Key Discovery Technologies  
In exploration, geologists and remote sensing can target Te-bearing systems by association. Telluride minerals (calaverite, sylvanite, hessite, petzite, etc.) occur most often in intrusion-related or epithermal gold-copper deposits.  Geochemical surveys (soil/stream sediments) can fingerprint Te via pathfinder elements (Bi, Sb, Au, Se) in prospective terrains.  Airborne magnetics, gravity and IP surveys delineate underlying porphyry/vein structures that could host Te.  High-resolution hyperspectral imaging (satellite or drone) can map alteration minerals (e.g. silica, carbonate, alunite) typical of Te-bearing deposits.  Modern discovery also uses GIS and ML to combine multi-source exploration data (geology, geochem, geophysics, drilling).  For example, indicator minerals like telluride inclusions in stream sediments have been used to locate gold-telluride ore bodies.  Even old mine dumps and tailings can be re-visited with ICP-MS assays to spot Te-rich zones (as Boliden has done).  Because Te is extremely scarce (~1–5 ppb in crust ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11919#:~:text=increased%20the%20demand%20for%20tellurium,6))), direct Te anomalies are rare; instead Te exploration often piggybacks on known Cu–Au exploration.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
**Copper Refinery Slime Processing:** The dominant source. In electrolytic copper refining, Te accumulates in anode slimes. Specialized circuits then process these slimes. For example, Utah’s Kennecott smelter now roasts and leaches its slimes to recover ~20 t/yr of granular Te ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,treated%20and%20discarded%20as%20mine)). Similar facilities in Canada and Japan roast or chlorinate slimes.  A recent study showed Te recovery can reach ~90% by roasting slimes at ~450 °C followed by alkaline (NaOH) leaching and precipitation ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11919#:~:text=with%20the%20composition%20Cu%3A%2031.8,Cu)). Modern smelters often use chlorine treatment: roasting slimes or mattes with chlorine converts Te to TeCl₄ gas, which is condensed and then hydrolyzed to TeO₂.  

**Pyrometallurgy:** Traditional routes include oxidizing roast or chlorination of slimes. Roasting slimes (or CuAnodeSulfide) at 600–800 °C drives off Te as oxide or sulfide vapors.  In chlorination, slimes are commingled with salt and heated or bubbled with Cl₂ gas; Te forms TeCl₄ vapor which is then scrubbed.  After volatilization, Te compounds are condensed, washed, and calcined to yield crude TeO₂ or metal.  

**Hydrometallurgy:** Alternative flows dissolve Te from slimes or ores. For example, oxidative acid leaches (H₂SO₄, HNO₃, HClO₄) can dissolve Te(0/IV) into solution. Te is then separated from Se and others by redox and precipitation: adjust pH or add SO₂ to selectively precipitate Te metal (leaving Se soluble).  Research by Sarangi et al. (2023) demonstrated a two-step process – roast at 450 °C, then 1 M NaOH leach – recovering ~90% of Te and 32% Cu from high-Te slime ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11919#:~:text=with%20the%20composition%20Cu%3A%2031.8,Cu)).  Other flowsheets use chloride lixiviants or thiourea. In some cases, Cu cementation is used: adding metallic Cu to tellurite solution causes Te to precipitate (forming “cement” slurries) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11919#:~:text=of%20tellurium%20is%20estimated%20at,22)).  

**Direct Telluride Ores:** In hypothetical primary deposits of gold-telluride (e.g. Carlin-type), conventional flotation can concentrate telluride minerals. The concentrate is smelted or roasted to TeO₂, followed by acid or alkaline leach and reduction.  Japanese industry once processed Au–Te ores via roasting + HCl leach to recover Te and other metals.  These methods mirror those for copper slimes but start with different feed.  

**Final Smelting/Reduction:**  Crude Te compounds (e.g. TeO₂) are reduced to metal. Commonly TeO₂ is mixed with carbon or hydrogen and heated (often under vacuum or inert gas) to distill Te metal at ~450–500 °C.  Vacuum distillation is widely used: TeO₂ vaporizes, then condenses on cooler surfaces to yield high-purity Te (the residue retains impurities) ([www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00084433.2024.2355031#:~:text=Skip%20to%20Main%20Content)).  

## Key Separation Technologies  
**Redox Precipitation:** In processing circuits, Te(IV) is separated from Se(IV) by selective reduction.  For example, after oxide leaching, SO₂ or a mild reductant is added at pH ≈1–2.  Te(IV) is reduced to elemental Te (purple precipitate) while Se stays largely in solution as Se(IV). This step yields a Te “sludge” which is filtered and then smelted. The chemistry (controlling Eh and pH) is tuned so that Te precipitates selectively ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11919#:~:text=of%20tellurium%20is%20estimated%20at,22)).  

**Solvent Extraction / Ion Exchange:**  Some flows convert Te to soluble tellurite (TeO₃²⁻) or tellurate (TeO₄²⁻) in alkaline media.  These anionic complexes can be extracted with organophosphorus solvents (e.g. TBP) or captured on strong-base anion-exchange resins. Te is then stripped and reprecipitated. Ion-exchange resin methods have been described in patents (e.g. US8349051) for efficient purification.  

**Cementation:** A practical industrial method is cementation: fine copper powder is added to Te-bearing solution (Na₂TeO₃). Metallic Cu dissolves as Cu²⁺, and Te(IV) is reduced to elemental Te. The Te metal deposits on the powder (separating visually), allowing nearly quantitative recovery of Te even from very dilute solutions ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/15/11919#:~:text=of%20tellurium%20is%20estimated%20at,22)).  

**Fractional Distillation:** Crude Te metal (or TeO₂) can be purified by vacuum distillation.  Under high vacuum at 500–600 °C, Te (vapor pressure ~160 Pa at 500 °C) vaporizes and recondenses in a cold trap. Impurities (Bi, Pb, etc.) remain mostly in the residue. Repeated distillation passes yield “4N–5N” (99.99–99.999%) Te for semiconductor use. For example, Japanese and Western refiners frequently use vacuum distillation to upgrade Te slugs.  

**Selective Crystallization:**  Some refinery schemes convert Te into crystalline salts. For example, tellurate salts (K₂TeO₄, Na₂TeO₃) have controlled solubility. By pH/temperature shifts, Te-bearing crystalline precipitates can form, separating Te from more soluble impurities. This can be followed by calcining the salt to TeO₂.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
**Zone Refining:** High-purity Te metal (semiconductor-grade) is often made by zone melting. An ingot of Te is gradually passed through a localized melt zone; impurities concentrate in the molten zone and move to one end. Multiple passes yield 5N–6N (99.999–99.9999%) Te metal suitable for infrared detectors and advanced electronics. Zone refining is a standard metallurgical technique for Te and other semiconductors ([www.tandfonline.com](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00084433.2024.2355031#:~:text=Skip%20to%20Main%20Content)).  

**Vacuum Distillation:** Complementary to zone refining, vacuum distillation can achieve ultra-high purity. For example, Prasad et al. (1982) showed Te metal could be distilled to 5N purity in graphite boats under high vacuum. Commercially, tellurium is repeatedly distilled in vacuum chambers, collecting the condensate in cold traps or tubes. An advanced method uses graphite-lined vacuum stills to minimize contamination.  

**Electrorefining:** Metallic Te can be electrorefined: impure Te anodes are dissolved in alkaline tellurite electrolyte, and pure Te is deposited on cathodes. This method efficiently separates Te from precious-metal impurities (Au, Ag) and from Bi/Pb. For instance, Canadian firm 5NPlus uses proprietary electrorefiners to produce 5N Te for CdTe PV from crude Te feed.  

**Chemical Cycling:**  Crude TeO₂ can be purified by dissolving in alkali (forming Na₂TeO₃) and then reprecipitating.  For example, dissolving TeO₂ in NaOH, filtering impurities, then reoxidizing and precipitating TeO₂ yields higher purity. Finally, H₂ or SO₂ reduction of purified TeO₂ gives metal.  These dissolution/recrystallization loops are used when very pure feeds are needed.  

**Hydrogen Reduction:** Some specialized refineries use hydrogen gas to reduce TeO₂ at ∼400–500 °C. This route can produce ultra-fine Te powder. Because H₂ reacts more cleanly (no carbon byproducts), it can yield extremely pure Te for electronics. The TeO₂ granules are exposed to H₂ (removing O₂) in a furnace, yielding Te metal.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
**CdTe PV Module Recycling:** Expanding recycling of end-of-life CdTe panels is critical. First Solar and others have engineered processes to dismantle modules (glass and aluminum removal), then chemically leach Cd and Te. First Solar reports recovering >90% of all module materials (including Te and Cd) for reuse ([www.firstsolar.com](https://www.firstsolar.com/en-Emea/Solutions/Recycling#:~:text=technologies,glass%2C%20rubber%2C%20and%20aluminum%20products)). In practice, current processes recover >95% of Te from shredded CdTe cells, yielding material that can be reused in new module production. EOL recycling both supplements supply and prevents toxic Cd/Te disposal.  

**Copper Tailings Reprocessing:** Since unrecovered Te accumulates in copper tailings and smelter dust, some operations test tailings leaching. Acidic (or bio-oxidation) re-leaching of old copper dumps can mobilize residual Te (along with Cu/Au). Pilot studies (e.g. in Chile) show that reprocessing tailings can extract additional Te (and Cu) and stabilize waste.  These projects simultaneously remediate legacy waste and recover Te from material otherwise discarded.  

**Effluent and Sludge Treatment:** Modern copper smelters use wet scrubbers and wastewater treatments to capture soluble Te. For example, insoluble Te(IV) in scrubber liquor is precipitated by adding lime or ferric sulfate, forming TeO₂ sludge that is filtered and recycled. These closed-loop scrubbing systems keep Te/Se out of effluent. The captured solids (anhydrite-type sludges) are then sent to Te recovery circuits.  

**Waste Stabilization:** Te-bearing residues (filter cakes, slags) are solidified to prevent leaching.  Captured Te sludges are often mixed with cement or polymers for disposal.  For instance, it is estimated that Kennecott’s new Te recovery will keep ~20 t/yr of Te out of tailings, reducing long-term risk. Encapsulation of the remaining Te-bearing waste minimizes environmental release.  

**Emissions Control:** Smelter off-gas filters (baghouses) and acid plants trap any volatilized Te/Se. These systems condense Te-rich gases onto filters, which are then reprocessed. Modern plants achieve >99% capture of these volatile byproducts, recycling them into recovery circuits instead of venting to air. Overall, contemporary Te production processes emphasize recycling intermediates and scrubbing to avoid environmental release.
