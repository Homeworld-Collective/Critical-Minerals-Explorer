## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:** Historically no active tellurium (Te) mines exist and domestic output was essentially zero. In 2022, Rio Tinto commissioned a Te recovery circuit at its Kennecott (Utah) copper refinery (~20 t/yr) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)), making it one of only two U.S. Te producers. Prior to that start‐up, U.S. “production” was entirely by-byproduct recovery from imported or recycled sources. Thus current U.S. mine production remains ≈0 t, with only the Kennecott stream adding ~20 t/yr ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)).  
• **Canada:** Canadian refiners (primarily at Kidd Creek and other copper/gold operations) produced on the order of 25–30 t in recent years. Columbia Univ. data indicate Canada accounted for ~4.1% of world Te output in 2022 ([criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu](https://criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu/countries/124/#:~:text=5)) (~400–410 t global). 4.1% of ~640–680 t is ≈26–28 t/yr, consistent with industry reports. Canada has no Te mines; all domestic output is recovered from copper/gold processing and electronic scrap.  
• **Japan:** Japan was a major Te source. In 2022 it supplied ~11.6% of world Te production ([criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu](https://criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu/countries/392/#:~:text=21.45)). Taking global output ~640–680 t, that implies ~75–80 t/yr from Japanese refiners. (Pan Pacific Copper’s Hitachi/Hibi smelters and Mitsui/TanioBIS operations historically processed Te-bearing copper concentrates.) Japan has no primary Te mines; all supply is byproduct recovery.  
• **European Union (e.g. Sweden):** The EU has no Te mines. Sweden’s Kankberg VMS deposit is a known Te source. Sweden produced ~5.65% of world Te in 2022 ([criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu](https://criticalmaterials.energypolicy.columbia.edu/countries/752/#:~:text=Share%20of%20total%20world%20production%2C,2022)) (≈35–40 t/yr). Other EU nations have negligible Te output. EU production is entirely from metallurgical slimes (Kankberg gold/copper) and recycled sources.  
• **Australia, Norway, Iceland:** These allies have no reported Te production. Australia’s critical-minerals strategy notes Te as an “identified mineral resource” (trace in copper/nickel ores), but no operating Te recovery. Likewise Norway/Iceland have no mine or refinery output.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **CdTe Photovoltaics:** The largest demand sector by far is cadmium–telluride (CdTe) solar modules. Te demand for CdTe cells is on the order of 150–200 g per kW of modules at present (with scope for reduction). With U.S./allied CdTe capacity expanding (First Solar planning ~6 GW/yr in the U.S. by mid-2020s ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=First%20Solar%2C%20which%20produces%20cadmium,manufacturing%20complex%20outside%20of%20China)), Europe building utilities, Japan/CAN exploring), Te consumption will rise. For example, Wood Mackenzie/SEIA project global PV will triple to 378 GW by 2028 ([www.streetwisereports.com](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/07/21/new-trade-tensions-with-china-could-increase-squeeze-on-solar-metal.html#:~:text=The%20U,Industries%20Association%20and%20Wood%20Mackenzie)); Technavio projects global Te demand up ~60 t (2020–24) in response ([www.streetwisereports.com](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/07/21/new-trade-tensions-with-china-could-increase-squeeze-on-solar-metal.html#:~:text=The%20solar%20market%20is%20expected,by%202028%2C%20the%20report%20said)). Scaling to 2030, allied CdTe PV demand could easily consume **hundreds of metric tons** (rough back-of-envelope: tens GW times ~150 g/kW yields dozens of tonnes/yr). This dwarfs current domestic output.  
• **Thermoelectric Devices:** Advanced thermoelectric materials (e.g. skutterudite or nanostructured alloys) use significant Te. Argus (2008) estimated ~30% of Te use is in thermoelectrics ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/ja/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2193825-rio-tinto-to-start-producing-tellurium-in-utah#:~:text=Tellurium%20is%20a%20semiconductor%20used,medical%20devices%20and%20CT%20scanning)). US and allied research (e.g. in waste heat recovery) suggests this fraction will grow, requiring tens of tonnes more by 2030.  
• **Metallurgical Alloys and Glass:** Te is added to specialty steels/Al alloys (improves machinability, grain refinement) and colored glasses. This accounts for roughly 10–15% of Te demand ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/ja/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2193825-rio-tinto-to-start-producing-tellurium-in-utah#:~:text=Tellurium%20is%20a%20semiconductor%20used,medical%20devices%20and%20CT%20scanning)). Allied steelmaking and specialty glass industries will therefore need on the order of 20–50 t/yr by 2030.  
• **Electronics/Sensors:** Te compounds (CdTe, HgCdTe, ZnCdTe) are used in infrared detectors, medical imaging and X-ray sensors. Growth in the semiconductor and medical-imaging sectors (EU, US, Japan) may add ~10% of Te demand by 2030. Proposed tellurium‐lithium batteries are experimental but could surface late-decade, adding unknown tons.  
• **Total Allied Demand Estimate:** Summing these, U.S. & allied demand by 2030 is likely on the order of **several hundred metric tons per year**. (For context, global demand was ~350 t/yr in 2020 ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361106799_Global_tellurium_supply_potential_from_electrolytic_copper_refining#:~:text=sumption%20for%20CdTe%20solar%20PV,350%20metric%20tons%2C%20assuming%20an)); projected PV growth and new technologies imply allied demand could approach 300–600 t/yr by 2030.)   

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Domestic Production Capacity:** Even with forecast increases, allied domestic Te “mined” or refined output will remain limited. By 2030, the largest continuous source is still Rio Tinto’s Kennecott (20 t/yr) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)). Canada can sustain ~25–30 t/yr from its copper-gold refineries. Sweden about 35–40 t/yr from Kankberg. Japan ~75 t/yr from its smelters. Summing these gives roughly 150 t/yr across all allies. New projects (e.g. First Tellurium’s BC/CO claims) are exploration-stage only now. Thus **allied domestic production** by 2030 might only be on the order of 100–200 t/yr.  
• **Recycling and Scraps:** Allied supply can be augmented by recycling. First Solar (US) and others recover >90% of Te from end-of-life CdTe modules; this returns several tons each year to the supply pool ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=challenging%20since%20commodity%20Te%20is,vide%20infra)). Other electronics and metallurgical scrap recycling could contribute additional tens of tons. However, recycling alone cannot fill the multi‐hundred tonne gap.  
• **Imports:** The balance of allied Te needs (~100 – 400 t/yr) will have to come from imports. China (by far the largest Te producer/exporter) and others (South Korea, Mexico, Peru, etc.) currently fill this role. By 2030, unless more allied output comes online, the U.S. and other allies will remain highly import-dependent.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Exploration targets known Te-bearing systems. Geologists map porphyry-Cu and epithermal gold fields (e.g. Cambodia/Vietnam-type, Alaskan hot-springs gold veins) where telluride minerals (calaverite, sylvanite, hessite) occur. Stream-sediment and soil sampling for Te and pathfinder elements (Bi, Sb, Se, Au) can highlight anomalies in favorable host lithologies ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/tellurium#:~:text=at%20Dashuigou%20and%20Majiagou%20,Present)). For example, Te was discovered at Dashuigou (China) during gold exploration.  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** While Te has no direct geophysical signature, airborne and ground geophysics (magnetics, induced-polarization, gravity, radiometrics) delineate the underlying structures. Identifying porphyry intrusions or geothermal alteration zones informs where Te-bearing Cu/Au mineralization might exist. High-resolution hyperspectral sensors can detect alteration minerals (e.g. alunite, silica) typical of epithermal deposits.  
• **Data Integration/ML:** Modern discovery uses GIS and machine-learning on multivariate datasets (geology, geochemistry, geophysics). Combining known Te occurrences with satellite geology and drill-core assays helps vector toward blind deposits.  
• **Re-examination of By-product Deposits:** Te often occurs in trace amounts. Reprocessing historic copper-gold tailings or analyzing preexisting ore samples for Te using ICP-MS can identify overlooked Te-rich sources (as in Sweden’s Kankberg re-evaluation).  
• **Isotopic/Indicator Mineral Techniques:** Te isotopes or indicator minerals (like Bi tellurides) in stream sediments might be exploited. However, Te’s extreme scarcity (3 ppb in crust ([www.usgs.gov](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/tellurium#:~:text=at%20Dashuigou%20and%20Majiagou%20,Present))) makes direct detection challenging; thus exploration usually piggybacks on established Cu-Au prospects.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Copper Electrorefinery Slime Processing:** The dominant extraction route. In electrolytic copper refining, Te accumulates in insoluble anode slimes. Specialized circuits (as at Rio’s Kennecott) then treat these slimes. For example, Kennecott’s new circuit vaporizes Te from smelter flue gases or slimes, yielding ~20 t/yr of granular Te ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)). Many refineries (in Canada, Japan, etc.) similarly roast or chlorinate slimes to separate Te/Se fractions. This extraction is a by-product adaptation of standard Cu refining.  
• **Pyrometallurgy of Slimes:** Traditional Pb–Ag refinery methods (Pan Pacific Copper’s Hibi smelter, Mitsui’s Ageo plant) roast anode slimes; Te volatilizes as TeO_2 or sulfur compounds, then condenses as metallic Te. Modern plants often use smelting or chlorination: slimes are treated with ferric chloride or HCl gas to convert Te to TeCl_4 vapors, which are then hydrolyzed to TeO_2.  
• **Hydrometallurgical Leaching:** Alternative approaches dissolve Te semi-refractory materials. Strong oxidizing acid leach (HNO_3/H_2O_2) can strip Te from slimes into solution as H_2TeO_3, which is then precipitated by reducing agents or by pH adjustment. Ion-exchange resins or solvent extraction can separate Te from Se and other metals in such solutions. These wet-chemical methods are less common but useful for recycling low-grade sources.  
• **Direct Mineral Processing:** Where Te occurs in telluride ores (e.g. Nagybörzsöny, Hungary or early First Solar test ores), conventional flotation can concentrate Au-Te minerals. Subsequent processing (roasting & acid leach or direct fusion) separates Te. Japan’s Mitsui/Pan Pacific historically used such approaches on high-Te concentrates.  
• **Thermal Refining:** Final steps often involve reductive smelting. TeO_2 (from roasting slimes) is mixed with reductants (e.g. carbon or H_2) and heated in an inert atmosphere to yield metallic Te (mp ~450 °C). Advanced versions use vacuum distillation of either Te metal or TeO_2 to achieve high purity. (For example, vacuum distillation at ~700–900 °C refines Te to 6N quality.)  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Precipitation & Redox Control:** In electrolytic slimes processing, Te is separated from selenium and precious metals by controlled oxidation/reduction. For instance, after HCl leaching, Te^4+/Te^6+ is precipitated by reducing it to elemental Te with agents like H_2O_2 or SO_2. Careful pH control allows Te(IV) to precipitate while Se and others remain in solution. Such selective chemistry yields Te sludges that are filtered and smelted to metal.  
• **Solvent Extraction / Ion Exchange:** Highly alkaline tellurite (Na_2TeO_3) or tellurate (Na_2TeO_4) solutions are compatible with anion-exchange resins or solvent-extractant carriers (e.g. quaternary ammonium salts) to separate Te from competing anions. After loading onto resin, Te is eluted and converted to TeO_2. This method is practiced in some specialty refineries for ultra-pure Te production.  
• **Fractional Distillation / Zone Refining:** Impure Te metal or TeO_2 is purified via distillation. Under reduced pressure, TeO_2 vaporizes and re-condenses in a cooler zone, leaving impurities behind. Alternatively, Te metal can be "zone-refined" (like Si) by passing a narrow molten zone along a Te ingot; impurities segregate. These methods achieve 5N–6N (99.999–99.9999%) Te metal for semiconductor use.  
• **Amalgamation/Precipitative Belt Methods:** Although largely historical, some refineries use lead-based amalgams. Cu anode mud is sometimes reduced with lead to form a Te–Pb alloy, which is then distilled. Modern processes have mostly replaced this with cleaner alternatives, but variants of it persist in some smelters.  
• **Selective Crystallization:** Tellurate salts (e.g. K_2TeO_4) have low solubility at certain temperatures/pH. Refiners can crystallize these salts out of solution, further separating Te from more soluble elements.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Zone Refining and Solidification:** High-purity Te for electronics is often produced by zone melting. A molten zone is passed through a Te ingot; impurities concentrate in the molten zone and are swept to one end. Multiple passes can yield 99.9999% Te (used in infrared detectors).  
• **Vacuum Distillation:** Ultra-pure Te metal is obtained by repeated vacuum distillation. A TeO_2 precursor (from roasting) or crude Te metal is heated in a vacuum; Te vapor condenses in a cooler portion of the apparatus. Newer systems using graphite-lined chambers minimize contamination.  
• **Electrolytic Refining:** Analogous to copper, Te metal itself can be electrorefined. A crude Te anode is dissolved in a fluoride or chloride melt and redeposited on cathodes. This removes residual metals (Bi, Pb, etc.). Japan’s TanioBIS and Canada’s 5N Plus use proprietary electrorefining to achieve “6N” Te for polysilicon and CdTe PV.  
• **Chemical Recrystallization:** TeO_2 is dissolved in alkaline or acidic media and re-precipitated to remove impurities. For example, dissolving crude Te in NaOH and re-crystallizing potassium tellurite yields a cleaner intermediate. Such chemical cycling, followed by reduction (with SO_2 or Fe), can improve purity.  
• **Gas-phase Reactions:** Advanced facilities convert Te intermediate compounds to volatile species for purification. For example, TeCl_4 vapor is passed through cold traps to separate Te. Plasma distillation techniques (a TeCl_4 plasma) are also under investigation for ultra-pure Te production.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **PV Module Recycling:** Expanding end-of-life CdTe PV recycling is essential. First Solar’s process (used in US and Europe) chemically bath-leaches Cd and Te from shredded modules and recovers >90% of each ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=challenging%20since%20commodity%20Te%20is,vide%20infra)). This not only recaptures critical Te but also avoids landfill of toxic Cd. Research is ongoing on improved solvents and recovered-material reuse.  
• **Copper Mine Tailings Treatment:** Since Te largely ends up in Cu tailings if unrecovered, some operations are piloting tailings reprocessing. Acid or bio-leaching of historic Cu tailings can extract residual Te (along with Cu/Au). This both remediates unstable dumps and supplies Te. For example, studies in Chile/Kongo have demonstrated hydrometallurgical recovery of Te from big tailings piles.  
• **Wastewater Scrubbing:** Refinery effluents containing Te (as tellurite) are treated by precipitation. Neutralization with calcium or iron salts converts soluble Te to insoluble TeO_2 or metal tellurides, which are filtered. Modern smelters include closed-loop scrubbers that capture Se/Te as solid “flue-catcher” residues, minimizing environmental release.  
• **Stabilization of Byproducts:** Captured Te-bearing sludges and slags must be stabilized. Additives (e.g. lime, Portland cement) are mixed with Te sludges to immobilize any soluble Te. Encapsulation prevents Te leaching from waste dumps. The reduced waste volume (e.g. Kennecott’s circuit cuts tailings by 20 t/yr of Te) simplifies long-term management ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)).  
• **Emissions Control & Chemisorption:** Reductive scrubbers in smelters convert any volatilized Te/Se back to solids before stack release. Novel sorbents (e.g. Te-adsorbing catalysts) are under study. Captured emissions are processed like slimes. Overall, modern Te production is designed to minimize pollution by recycling intermediate wastes.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The principal bottleneck is **Te recovery capability in copper refining**. Today’s copper leaching/electrorefining plants are optimized for Cu and do not capture all contained Te. As DOE notes, existing refineries often *“have not yet deployed”* Te recovery units ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=Breakthroughs%20in%20the%20production%2C%20refining%2C,Increasing%20Te%20production%20can%20be)). The Kennecott example shows it is feasible, but most allied refineries still send anode slimes to tailings. Without retrofitting these facilities with Te extraction processes (chlorination, roasting, dedicated electrolytic cells, etc.), significant Te remains lost. In practice, this limits allied Te output to the ~20–80 t/yr range (Ken~~20 t + existing byproduct streams) despite much higher theoretical potential ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=Breakthroughs%20in%20the%20production%2C%20refining%2C,Increasing%20Te%20production%20can%20be)) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)). In short, lack of co-product recovery tech in the copper refining chain seriously constrains US/allied Te supply.  

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
Tellurium is virtually never mined directly; almost all supply comes as **byproduct of copper/gold refining**. The bottleneck is that many allied-era refineries lack efficient Te recovery steps. For example, only Rio Tinto’s Kennecott has a dedicated 20 t/yr Te circuit ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)), while other plants omit this step. Thus, despite rising demand, US/allied Te production is capped by **processing technology**, not geology. Expanding extraction will require retrofitting refineries to capture the Te in anode slimes ([www.energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/cadmium-telluride-photovoltaics-perspective-paper#:~:text=Breakthroughs%20in%20the%20production%2C%20refining%2C,Increasing%20Te%20production%20can%20be)) ([www.riotinto.com](https://www.riotinto.com/news/releases/2022/Rio-Tinto-starts-tellurium-production-at-Kennecott/#:~:text=Approximately%2020%20tons%20of%20tellurium,and%20discarded%20as%20mine%20tailings)). These missing recovery technologies are presently the main constraint on raising domestic Te output.
