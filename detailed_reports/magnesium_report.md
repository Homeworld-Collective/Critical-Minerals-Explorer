## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
The United States and its close allies currently have **no active primary magnesium (Mg) smelters**.  The US produces 0 MT/yr Mg metal domestically (all US magnesium is imported) ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=The%20situation%20has%20countries%20like,aiming%20for%20zero%20emission%20goals)).  Likewise, Canada and Australia have *magnesium compounds* (MgO/MgCO₃) mining (e.g. Australian magnesite mines at Rockhampton ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/education/minerals-energy/australian-mineral-facts/magnesium#:~:text=Resources))) but no primary Mg metal plants.  The EU stopped primary Mg production (last plant closed in 2001 ([www.verdemg.com](https://www.verdemg.com/archives/category/uncategorized#:~:text=The%20EU%20depends%20heavily%20on,such%20as%20Israel%20and%20Turkey))) and relies almost entirely on imports.  Indeed, the EU is “heavily dependent” on Chinese imports for magnesium ([ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=653608&title=International_trade_in_critical_raw_materials#:~:text=Highlights)), and Japan imports about 99% of its Mg supply from China ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=The%20situation%20has%20countries%20like,aiming%20for%20zero%20emission%20goals)).  In practice, current “domestic” Mg production for US/allies is essentially zero – Europe and Japan import tens of thousands of tons per year while US imports were only ~3.24 kt in 2022 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/USA/year/2022/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/product/810490#:~:text=United%20States%20imports%20of%20Magnesium,80K%20%2C%2018%2C531%20Kg)).  (For context, world Mg production is on the order of 800–900 kt/yr, ~90% from China+Russia ([www.minago.ca](https://www.minago.ca/blank-5#:~:text=Used%20in%20the%20aerospace%2C%20automotive%2C,not%20produced%20Mg%20for%20decades)).)

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Magnesium demand is forecast to rise steeply by 2030 due to electric vehicles, aerospace, and lightweighting in aluminum alloys.  Automobiles and EVs are the largest drivers: roughly ~50–60% of Mg goes into aluminum automotive alloying ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/education/minerals-energy/australian-mineral-facts/magnesium#:~:text=The%20largest%20single%20use%20for,titanium%20in%20the%20Kroll%20process)) and ~20–30% into cast components like EV battery housings ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2365954-magnesium-sector-eyes-growing-opportunities-in-evs#:~:text=A%20typical%20battery%20pack%2C%20using,by%202030%2C%20according%20to%20Argus)) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/education/minerals-energy/australian-mineral-facts/magnesium#:~:text=The%20largest%20single%20use%20for,titanium%20in%20the%20Kroll%20process)).  For example, a typical EV battery pack housing uses ~60 kg of Mg ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2365954-magnesium-sector-eyes-growing-opportunities-in-evs#:~:text=A%20typical%20battery%20pack%2C%20using,by%202030%2C%20according%20to%20Argus)).  With global EV sales projected ~26 million by 2030 ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2365954-magnesium-sector-eyes-growing-opportunities-in-evs#:~:text=A%20typical%20battery%20pack%2C%20using,by%202030%2C%20according%20to%20Argus)), potential Mg demand in vehicles alone could approach 1.5×10^6 t (global) if widely adopted.  If even 20–30% of those vehicles are sold in US/EU/Canada/Australia/Japan, that implies on the order of ~300–450 kt just for EVs.  Other sectors (aircraft, electronics) add more.  By scaling current consumption, allied demand could be on the order of **hundreds of thousands of tons** by 2030.  (As data points, the EU imported ~171,500 t of Mg articles in 2021 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/EUN/year/2021/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/product/8104#:~:text=European%20Union%20imports%20of%20Magnesium%3B,63K%20%2C%20705%2C710%20Kg)) and US only ~3.24 kt in 2022 ([wits.worldbank.org](https://wits.worldbank.org/trade/comtrade/en/country/USA/year/2022/tradeflow/Imports/partner/ALL/product/810490#:~:text=United%20States%20imports%20of%20Magnesium,80K%20%2C%2018%2C531%20Kg)); even modest CAGR growth (5–7% p.a. ([southeast.newschannelnebraska.com](https://southeast.newschannelnebraska.com/story/51925469/magnesium-metal-industry-research-2023-to-2033-consumer-preferences-towards-nutritional-supplements-and-shift-towards-lightweight-materials-bolsters#:~:text=The%20global%20magnesium%20metal%20market,during%20the%20forecast%20period))) from those bases would yield roughly 200–300 kt in two decades.)  In sum, US+allied Mg demand by 2030 is expected to be on the order of a few 10^5 t/yr, dominated by automotive and high-tech alloy usage, unless major substitution occurs.

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Planned new projects suggest some domestic supply by 2030, but still well below demand.  Key potential suppliers include:  
- **USA:** The existing Utah Great Salt Lake operation (US Magnesium LLC) has capacity ~63.5 kt/yr ([usmagnesium.com](https://usmagnesium.com/about-us-mag/#:~:text=US%20Magnesium%20has%20the%20capacity,acres%20including%20100%20square%20miles)).  If fully utilized, this could be a major domestic source.  New processes (e.g. direct electrolysis of brines) are also being piloted but not yet commercial.  Secondary recycled Mg (aluminum turnout, scrap) in the US is ~100 kt/yr ([www.statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1472002/secondary-magnesium-production-in-the-united-states/#:~:text=U.S.%20secondary%20magnesium%20production%202024,Magnesium%20is%20considered%20a%20critical)), which supplements availability.  
- **EU (Romania):** Verde Magnesium has a concession on a dormant Romanian magnesite mine and plans a renewably-powered Mg plant. It expects to start ~2027 at ~90,000 t/yr, enough to meet ~45% of EU demand ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f77bf51f-0cae-42bf-8d9c-c11d24dac906#:~:text=stable%20supply%20and%20support%20Europe%27s,sets%20goals%20for%20mining%2C%20processing)). This would be the first EU primary Mg source in decades. (No other EU projects are yet committed.)  
- **Australia:** The startup Magnium Australia (in partnership with CSIRO) is developing a novel zero-carbon Mg smelter. It aims to produce >100,000 t/yr by ~2032 ([www.magnium.com.au](https://www.magnium.com.au/#:~:text=growth%20of%20renewables%2C%20create%20hundred%E2%80%99s,green%20critical%20minerals%2C%20driven%20in)). By 2030 Magnium could be at tens of thousands of t/yr capacity.  
- **Canada:** Canada has no current Mg metal plant, but new nickel deposits host thick Mg-rich cover rock.  For example, West High Yield’s Record Ridge (BC) contains ~10.6 Mt of magnesite and is slated to begin production in Q3 2024 ([investingnews.com](https://investingnews.com/securing-north-americas-strategic-and-critical-magnesium-supply-chain/#:~:text=Supporting%20infrastructure%20for%20the%20project%2C,Yield%20is%20currently%20exploring%20additional)).  If developed, it could supply feedstock for Mg production.  (Ni-based projects like Minago are investigating extracting Mg from waste dolomite ([www.minago.ca](https://www.minago.ca/blank-5#:~:text=The%20Minago%20Ni%2FPGM%20deposit%20sits,material%20into%20an%20economic%20commodity)).)  
- **Norway/Iceland/Japan:** No primary plants; Japan continues to import (mostly from Russia/China) ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=The%20situation%20has%20countries%20like,aiming%20for%20zero%20emission%20goals)), and Norway/Iceland have no Mg metal outputs.  

In sum, by 2030 allied domestic production might reach perhaps ~200–300 kt/yr (e.g. 63 kt from US + 90 kt from Romania + incremental Australia/Canada), versus demand on the order of several hundred kilotons, implying continued import reliance.

Historical shares (93% from China/Russia) are from industry data ([www.minago.ca](https://www.minago.ca/blank-5#:~:text=Used%20in%20the%20aerospace%2C%20automotive%2C,not%20produced%20Mg%20for%20decades)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geological Mapping & Geochemistry:** Map and sample Mg-bearing lithologies (dolomite, serpentinite, magnesite). High-Mg carbonate units are traced in outcrop and soil/stream sampling. For example, Canada’s Minago Ni-dolomite cover was identified as 10–12% Mg ([www.minago.ca](https://www.minago.ca/blank-5#:~:text=The%20Minago%20Ni%2FPGM%20deposit%20sits,material%20into%20an%20economic%20commodity)), suggesting critical Mg mineralization underlain. Elemental assays (XRF for MgO) and rock/geochemical anomalies (high Mg/Ca ratios) flag prospective zones.  
• **Remote Sensing (Hyperspectral):** Mg carbonates (magnesite vs calcite/dolomite) show distinct VNIR/SWIR absorption features. Hyperspectral imagers (airborne or satellite) can distinguish high-Mg carbonates by their shifted OH-band positions ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/8/1325#:~:text=accessory%20minerals,The%20spectral)). For instance, laboratory studies show the Mg–OH vibrational band in magnesite shifts with Mg content ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/8/1325#:~:text=accessory%20minerals,The%20spectral)), enabling identification of Mg-rich outcrops.  
• **Geophysical Surveys:** Gravity and magnetic surveys can detect dense marble/dolomite bodies or alteration zones. Magnesite has slightly lower density (≈2.9 g/cm³) than typical host rock, so gravity lows may indicate ore. EM/induced polarization surveys help outline sub-surface carbonate structures and clayized zones often associated with Mg alteration.  
• **Brine and Seawater Sampling:** In regions with saline lakes or geothermal wells, chemical analysis of brines can reveal dissolved magnesium concentrations. High-Mg brines (as in Utah’s Great Salt Lake or the Dead Sea) guide location of potential desalination extraction. Methods include pumping/brine sampling and measuring Mg²⁺ and residual salts crystallization.  
• **Re-evaluating Waste/Byproducts:** Assess tailings and industrial residues as Mg sources. Example: Mine development may first quarry carbonate waste-rock (dolomite) as an unnecessary overburden – as at Canada’s Record Ridge (10.6 Mt Mg in waste) ([investingnews.com](https://investingnews.com/securing-north-americas-strategic-and-critical-magnesium-supply-chain/#:~:text=Supporting%20infrastructure%20for%20the%20project%2C,Yield%20is%20currently%20exploring%20additional)). Similarly, bauxite red mud or coal fly ash (Mg-bearing) are screened by analytical geochemistry for Mg content.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Pidgeon (Silicothermic) Reduction:** The classic thermal process (invented in Canada) remains widespread. Calcined dolomite (MgO) is mixed with a reductant (often ferrosilicon) and heated in sealed retorts under deep vacuum (~10⁻²–10⁻³ Pa) at ~1150–1400 °C ([www.verdemg.com](https://www.verdemg.com/archives/category/uncategorized#:~:text=,to%20dolime)). Magnesium vapor distills off and is condensed to metal. Modern vertical retort designs (China) improve throughput: each retort can yield ~65–70 kg per batch vs ~25–30 kg in old horizontal units ([www.verdemg.com](https://www.verdemg.com/archives/category/uncategorized#:~:text=,appropriately%20expanded%20to%20retort%20volume)). Slag is removed after each cycle. Pidgeon is energy-intensive (and CO₂-emitting if FeSi is used).  
• **Aluminothermic Reduction:** Powdered alumina-free MgO is blended with aluminum (and flux) and ignited. The exothermic reaction (3 MgO + 2 Al → 3 Mg + Al₂O₃) produces molten Mg that vaporizes or is collected once the reaction self-heats. This method (a form of thermite reaction) avoids external heating. It is used on small to moderate scale (e.g. California Magnesium process) for ~10–20% of world Mg and requires non-oxidized MgO feed.  
• **Electrolysis of MgCl₂ (Dow Process):** Anhydrous MgCl₂ (often from dehydrated sea/lake brine or carnallite salts) is melted in a cell (often with NaCl/CaCl₂ flux) at ~700 °C. Passing a direct current reduces Mg²⁺ to metal at the cathode and produces Cl₂ gas at the anode. This produces high-purity Mg ingots. It requires high-purity feed and large electricity supply; historically used e.g. at Dow in USA and in parts of Israel/Turkey.  
• **Molten-Salt Electrolysis & Other Novel Methods:** Research continues on new electrolytic routes. For example, molten-salt electrolysis of MgO in CaCl₂ (FFC-Cambridge cell) has been demonstrated at lab scale. Continuous tilt-reactors and multiple-effect distillations are being developed ([www.frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/chemistry/articles/10.3389/fchem.2023.1192202/full#:~:text=Frontiers%20,Salt%20Electrolysis%20View%20all%205)) to improve efficiency. In general, electrolytic methods are considered key “breakthrough” targets for cleaner Mg.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Magnesium Vapor Condensation:** In thermal reduction (Pidgeon, aluminothermic), Mg is produced as vapor. The primary separation is physical: the Mg vapor decoalesces on cool surfaces as pure metal, leaving behind nonvolatile slag (Ca₂SiO₄ etc.). Careful temperature control ensures Mg condenses while MgO/Fe remains in slag.  
• **Slag Separation:** After reduction, the solidified magnesium (often ~~83% purity) is physically separated from the calcium silicate or aluminate slag (by breaking retorts or skimming). Supplementary separation occurs when Al₂O₃ (from aluminothermic) is less dense and may be decanted off.  
• **Vacuum Refining:** Molten crude Mg (from any process) can be flashed under vacuum. Since Mg boils at 1,090 °C, evacuating molten Mg causes it to vaporize and recondense away from higher-boiling impurities (Cu, Ni, Fe, etc.). This in-situ vaporization (as in the Pidgeon cooling) inherently separates pure Mg from slagging agents.  
• **Crystallization:** For electrolytic Mg, once solidified, ingots may still contain residual salts. These are leached out (water-washing the metal) or removed by mechanical means. Centrifugation of molten Mg can also separate entrained slag.  
• **Electrolytic Refining (Conceptual):** Analogous to zinc countercurrent cells, proposals exist for refining Mg by electrolysis (e.g. using impure Mg anodes in molten salt baths to plate pure Mg). These have not yet seen large-scale use.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Vacuum Distillation:** The predominant method to achieve high-purity Mg. Crude Mg ingots are melted and subjected to high vacuum distillation (often in multi-stage columns) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/1/85#:~:text=match%20at%20L213%20Therefore%2C%20vacuum,explained%20in%20the%20following%20section)). Under <10⁻³ Pa, Mg vaporizes (T ≈700–750 °C) leaving most impurities (Zn, Pb, etc.) in the residue ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/1/85#:~:text=match%20at%20L213%20Therefore%2C%20vacuum,explained%20in%20the%20following%20section)). Condensing Mg in successive stages yields metal of 6N (99.9999%) purity. Vacuum distillation is energy-intensive but remains the industry standard for 5–6N Mg ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/1/85#:~:text=match%20at%20L213%20Therefore%2C%20vacuum,explained%20in%20the%20following%20section)).  
• **Remelting and Fluxing:** To remove oxide inclusions, molten Mg is often fluxed (e.g. chlorine gas injection or use of chemical fluxes like sulfur-halogen mixtures) and filtered through cloth or ceramic filters. This yields cleaner metal for final cast.  
• **Centrifugal Casting:** High-purity Mg alloys can be produced by spray or centrifugal casting, which further removes dross.  
• **Zone Refining (Experimental):** Analogous to semiconductor purification, a molten zone is passed along a Mg ingot to segregate impurities at one end. This achieves ultra-high purity (research-scale).  
• **Electrolytic Polishing:** For applications needing ultimate purity (semiconductor grade), a dissolved MgCl₂ bath can re-electroplate Mg with controlled impurity rejection.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Effluent pH Neutralization:** Electrolytic and extraction plants discharge Mg-rich wastewater. Treatment often involves adding lime or caustic to precipitate Mg as Mg(OH)₂, which can be filtered out. The residual filtrate (low in heavy metals) can be safely discharged. Some processes recover CO₂ by reacting it with Mg(OH)₂ to form magnesite, aiding carbon sequestration.  
• **Slag Reuse:** Calcium silicate slag (from Pidgeon) is alkaline and can be repurposed as cement/construction additive, or backfilled, reducing waste. Unwanted Mg-rich solids (from hydrate processing) can similarly be calcined or converted to Mg(OH)₂.  
• **Gas Scrubbing:** Chlorine gas from MgCl₂ electrolysis or HCl from Al-Mg scrap treatments is scrubbed in water or caustic scrubbers to recover hydrochloric acid or bleach, preventing air emissions. Fluoride byproducts from fluoride-containing fluxes are captured in lime scrubbers to produce harmless CaF₂ slag.  
• **Dust and Fume Controls:** Dedicated filters (baghouses) and electrostatic precipitators remove particulate MgO dust and metal fume. Collected dust is often recycled back into the process or stabilized in concrete.  
• **Brine Crystallization:** Spent brines (after Mg removal) are evaporated or crystallized to recover NaCl and KCl for reuse, minimizing liquid discharge. Remaining magnesium residues are solidified in waste ponds.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
• **Low-Carbon Primary Reduction:** The largest bottleneck is developing a cleaner replacement for the traditional reduction step.  Presently, Pidgeon or electrolytic processes demand huge energy inputs (thermal or electrical) and often fossil reductants. For example, Pidgeon reduction requires calcination and vacuum heating above 1150 °C ([www.verdemg.com](https://www.verdemg.com/archives/category/uncategorized#:~:text=,to%20dolime)), leading to high CO₂ and cost.  Without a breakthrough (e.g. renewable-powered electrolysis or new chemical reductants), scaling allied production is limited by energy/carbon constraints ([www.verdemg.com](https://www.verdemg.com/archives/category/uncategorized#:~:text=,to%20dolime)) ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=The%20situation%20has%20countries%20like,aiming%20for%20zero%20emission%20goals)).

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
In sum, the critical bottleneck is the **high energy and carbon cost of primary Mg extraction and refining**.  Conventional processes (thermal or electrolytic) are energy-intensive and emit CO₂ (e.g. Pidgeon’s vacuum heating ([www.verdemg.com](https://www.verdemg.com/archives/category/uncategorized#:~:text=,to%20dolime))), making them difficult to justify in carbon-sensitive US/EU economies ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=The%20situation%20has%20countries%20like,aiming%20for%20zero%20emission%20goals)).  Until low-carbon alternatives (e.g. renewable-powered electrolysis or novel reductants) become viable, domestic Mg output will remain constrained.  This energy/emissions hurdle is thus the pivotal technology challenge for US/allied magnesium supply.
