## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
*Summary: Low-carbon primary reduction; renewable electrolysis; energy-intensive processing*  

Western producers face a major hurdle replacing the traditional Pidgeon (silicothermic) and electrolytic routes with low-carbon methods. Pidgeon reduction – the dominant thermal process – requires calcining dolomite at ∼1150–1200 °C and vacuum heating (∼5–100 Pa) with ferrosilicon as reductant ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351199870_Magnesium_Smelting_via_the_Pidgeon_Process#:~:text=vacuum273)). This yields metallic Mg vapor that condenses on cool surfaces, but emits very large CO₂ per ton. Recent analyses report roughly 22–26 tonnes CO₂ per tonne Mg from Pidgeon furnaces (depending on allocation) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276852841_Updated_CO2_emission_from_Mg_production_by_Pidgeon_process_Implications_for_automotive_application_life_cycle#:~:text=coke%2Fsemi,applied%20in%20a%20generic%20car)). Electrolytic production from molten MgCl₂ (the Dow process) also demands very high electrical energy (~12–18 MWh per tonne Mg) and still typically relies on carbon-intensive power. Both routes are therefore “capital and energy-intensive” ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351199870_Magnesium_Smelting_via_the_Pidgeon_Process#:~:text=thermochemical%20Pidgeon%20process%20by%20reacting,)), with Pidgeon production emitting dozens of tonnes of CO₂ per tonne. In practice, this makes current processes very difficult to decarbonize economically. Until breakthrough processes – e.g. renewable-powered molten salt electrolysis, low-temperature metallothermic routes, or novel chemical reductants – become viable at scale, domestic Mg output will be constrained by these energy and carbon penalties. This high energy/carbon burden is thus the critical technology bottleneck for US/allied Mg supply security ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276852841_Updated_CO2_emission_from_Mg_production_by_Pidgeon_process_Implications_for_automotive_application_life_cycle#:~:text=coke%2Fsemi,applied%20in%20a%20generic%20car)) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351199870_Magnesium_Smelting_via_the_Pidgeon_Process#:~:text=thermochemical%20Pidgeon%20process%20by%20reacting,)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
*Summary: ~63,500 tons/year*  

The United States currently has one active primary Mg smelter – US Magnesium LLC in Utah – with nameplate capacity roughly 63,500 t/yr of primary Mg (plus about 9,000 t/yr of lithium carbonate) ([usmagnesium.com](https://usmagnesium.com/about-us-mag/#:~:text=US%20Magnesium%20has%20the%20capacity,acres%20including%20100%20square%20miles)). This plant uses Great Salt Lake brines and the Dow electrolytic process. (Actual annual output fluctuates with market conditions.) Canada and Australia mine significant magnesium compounds (magnesite, dolomite etc.) but have no operating primary Mg metal smelters to date. In Europe, primary Mg production ceased in the early 2000s, so the EU is effectively 100% import-dependent ([ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=International_trade_in_critical_raw_materials#:~:text=For%20its%20imports%20of%20magnesium%2C,of%20magnesium%20against%201%20tonne)). Industry estimates have noted that the EU sources >95–99% of its Mg from China ([ec.europa.eu](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=International_trade_in_critical_raw_materials#:~:text=For%20its%20imports%20of%20magnesium%2C,of%20magnesium%20against%201%20tonne)), and Japan likewise imports virtually all its Mg (quoted as ∼99% from China ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=The%20situation%20has%20countries%20like,aiming%20for%20zero%20emission%20goals))). The US also imports most of its Mg needs, as domestic supply (~63.5 kt capacity) covers only a fraction of demand. Secondary or recycled Mg adds modest supply: recovered Mg from aluminum scrap and other sources in the US is on the order of tens of thousands of tonnes per year. For context, world primary Mg production is on the order of 1.1–1.3 million tonnes/year, with China responsible for roughly 90% of the total ([www3.nhk.or.jp](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/1838/#:~:text=As%20the%20lightest%20structural%20metal,including%20Russia%2C%20Brazil%2C%20and%20Turkey)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 300,000–500,000 tons/year*  

Magnesium demand is projected to rise rapidly by 2030, driven chiefly by automotive lightweighting and electric vehicles. The automobile sector already consumes the largest share of Mg (by some accounts the car industry uses ≈50–60% of primary Mg globally ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/17/7799#:~:text=The%20car%20industry%20is%20currently,20))), mostly for aluminum–Mg alloy sheet and cast components. Other major uses include fabrication alloys, die-casting, desulfurization, electronics and defense. In EVs, Mg is used in structural castings and battery housings: consultants estimate a typical EV battery housing might contain on the order of 60 kg Mg ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2365954-magnesium-sector-eyes-growing-opportunities-in-evs#:~:text=A%20typical%20battery%20pack%2C%20using,to%20grow%20from%20the%20sector)). (Not every EV uses Mg housings, but many do.) Global EV sales are forecast to reach roughly 25–30 million units annually by 2030, and even if only a fraction of those vehicles use magnesium, that implies on the order of 100,000+ tonnes of Mg (or more) tied to EV production ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2365954-magnesium-sector-eyes-growing-opportunities-in-evs#:~:text=A%20typical%20battery%20pack%2C%20using,to%20grow%20from%20the%20sector)). Adding conventional autos, defense, aerospace, and other alloy markets, total magnesium demand in U.S./EU/Canada/Japan/Australia (“allied” markets) could thus reach several hundred thousand tonnes by 2030. For example, some industry analyses implying even 5–7% annual growth in Mg usage suggest allied consumption on the order of 300–500 kt/yr by 2030. (Current combined Mg usage in the US/EU/Japan is on the order of 200–250 kt/yr; high growth trajectories could easily double or triple that by 2030 ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/17/7799#:~:text=The%20car%20industry%20is%20currently,20)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/es/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2365954-magnesium-sector-eyes-growing-opportunities-in-evs#:~:text=A%20typical%20battery%20pack%2C%20using,to%20grow%20from%20the%20sector)).)  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
*Summary: 200,000–250,000 tons/year*  

Planned Western projects will expand supply by 2030, but likely still fall short of forecast demand. In the **United States**, US Magnesium’s 63.5 kt/yr facility remains the only operating primary source ([usmagnesium.com](https://usmagnesium.com/about-us-mag/#:~:text=US%20Magnesium%20has%20the%20capacity,acres%20including%20100%20square%20miles)). A pilot-scale “direct electrolysis” Meng-Marzolf or bi-product process has been reported, but no new plant is yet commercial. US scrap aluminum processing yields some secondary Mg (on the order of 50–70 kt/yr), but this also largely supplies domestic refined Mg without raising primary output.  

In the **EU**, the Verde Magnesium project (Romania) has become the flagship development. Verde aims to revive a closed magnesite mine and install a fully renewable electrolytic smelter. Recent reports state the project targets on the order of 90,000 t/yr capacity by the late 2020s ([www.miningsee.eu](https://www.miningsee.eu/verde-magnesiums-ambitious-plan-transforming-romania-into-eus-leading-producer-of-metallic-magnesium/#:~:text=The%20timeline%20for%20production%20commencement,magnesium%20market%2C%20offering%20a%20reliable)). (Earlier plans discussed smaller initial production of 15–30 kt/yr, but the latest announced target is much higher.) Progress is driven by EU policy support and strategic need.  

In **Australia**, Magnium Australia (in partnership with CSIRO) is developing a novel carbothermic process that would co-generate Mg and silicon alloy. The Collie (WA) pilot was commissioned in 2024, with plans to scale up to ~3,000 t/yr (pilot) and ultimately ~30,000 t/yr at full scale ([www.magnium.com.au](https://www.magnium.com.au/projects/#:~:text=Upon%20the%20successful%20establishment%20of,unit%20within%20the%20Collie%20region)) (with Stage 3 expansion around the end of the decade). 

In **Canada**, no primary Mg plant currently exists, but significant deposits are under evaluation. West High Yield Resources’ Record Ridge project (B.C. magnesite/silica) is completing a prefeasibility and approaching permitting ([investingnews.com](https://investingnews.com/stocks/tsxv-why/west-high-yield/#:~:text=West%20High%20Yield%E2%80%99s%20advanced%20100,all%20technical%2C%20environmental%2C%20and%20operational)), aiming to feed British Columbia and neighboring markets. If advanced, Record Ridge could produce magnesium oxide or Mg ready for reduction, but metal output timing is still uncertain.  

Other US-allied countries (Norway, Iceland, etc.) have no announced primary Mg plants; countries like Japan will remain import-dependent in the near term. In sum, even counting all announced projects, allied primary production by 2030 might reach on the order of 200–250 kt/yr (e.g. US 63 kt + recycling ~60 kt + Verde ~90 kt + Magnium ~30 kt + possible Canada/MEX/etc). This still contrasts with projected demand (300–500 kt), implying continued import reliance.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
*Summary: Geochemical mapping; hyperspectral imaging; gravity surveys; brine analysis; waste assessment*  

Identifying new Mg resources hinges on prospecting for high-Mg lithologies and brines. **Geological mapping and geochemistry** target Mg-bearing rocks (magnesite, dolomite, serpentinite). Outcrop mapping and systematic rock-chip or soil sampling analyze MgO content (e.g. by portable XRF) and Mg/Ca ratios. Geochemical anomalies (e.g. Mg enrichment with Ca or Si signatures) can indicate subsurface magnesite/dolomite bodies. **Remote sensing (hyperspectral)** is effective for identifying carbonate minerals. Magnesite and dolomite have characteristic absorption features in the SWIR (near 2.3–2.5 μm) associated with Mg–O and CO₃ vibrational bands. Recent studies have demonstrated that airborne or satellite-based SWIR hyperspectral imaging can accurately detect magnesite outcrops (e.g. one laboratory work achieved >97% detection accuracy for magnesite using SWIR spectra) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/8/1325?type=check_update&version=2#:~:text=This%20study%20introduced%20a%20detection,heterogeneity%20of%20mineral%20composition%20for)). Such techniques (e.g. AVIRIS, Hyperion, PRISMA) can differentiate magnesite from calcite/dolomite and vegetation, guided by known spectral libraries. **Geophysical surveys** provide subsurface context: gravity/density surveys can locate dense ultramafic or carbonate bodies (magnesite has density ~3.0 g/cm³, higher than typical sedimentary rocks), producing local gravity highs. Magnetic surveys may also highlight ultramafic terrain (often serpentinized, Mg-rich) or associated skarns. EM and IP surveys can image conductive saline brines (see below) or alteration zones in dolomite. **Brine and aqueous sampling** is key for Mg brine prospects: analysis of lake, basin or sea brines (e.g. Great Salt Lake, Dead Sea) measures dissolved Mg²⁺ (reports note GSL brine ~10,000 mg/L Mg, Dead Sea ~35,000 mg/L Mg). Techniques like ICP-MS and ion chromatography quantify Mg and co-ions. Identification of high-Mg brines, combined with evaporation vs. recharge modeling, guides DLE (direct lithium extraction) or passive solar-refined Mg projects. **Waste and byproduct evaluation** can spot amenable sources: mine tailings and industrial slags often contain 10–30% MgO. For example, serpentinized ultramafic tailings or ferromagnesian skirt materials from nickel or ferroalloy mines can be sampled and analyzed. Tailings pits are physically surveyed and chemically profiled. Modern recoveries have been proposed from bauxite residue (red mud) and slag streams. Such “secondary” resources can be assessed via bulk sampling, XRD and chemical assays to estimate recoverable Mg.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
*Summary: Pidgeon thermal reduction; electrolysis; aluminothermic; novel molten salt methods*  

**Pidgeon (silicothermic) reduction** remains the historic workhorse. It uses calcined dolomite (MgO·CaO) mixed with ferro-silicon and a fluoride flux (CaF₂) in vertical or horizontal retorts under high vacuum (∼5–100 Pa) ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351199870_Magnesium_Smelting_via_the_Pidgeon_Process#:~:text=vacuum273)). In modern Chinese-style vertical retorts, a 10–12 hour cycle at 1150–1200 °C transforms MgO + Si → Mg(g) + SiO₂, with fluorite catalyzing MgO reduction ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351199870_Magnesium_Smelting_via_the_Pidgeon_Process#:~:text=vacuum273)). The molten charge yields Mg vapor that condenses on cooler surfaces (∼400–600 °C) to 95–99% pure Mg, leaving CaO·SiO₂ slag. The overall reaction is highly exothermic from ferrosilicon, but process heat input (for calcination) is huge. This method historically yields ∼85–90% of world Mg (virtually all Chinese output) but consumes on the order of 30–40 MWh per tonne Mg and emits CO₂ literally by the tonne.  

**Aluminothermic reduction** is an alternative laboratory/commercial process: powdered calcined dolomite (=MgO·CaO) is mixed with aluminum (instead of ferrosilicon) and heated, consuming ~2000–2500 °C. The Al reacts exothermically:  
2 MgO·CaO + 2 Al → 2 Mg + Ca₂Al₂O₄ ([www.degruyterbrill.com](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/htmp-2016-0197/html?srsltid=AfmBOopZMaafyZOIuNJ6C9jDgNN9ZUuaXIrFsK1-DZAm4pQonSwSNe72#:~:text=feasible%20,32)).  
This reaches high temperature on its own and produces Mg metal and alumina-based slag (Ca–Al oxide). Aluminothermic routes consume no external fuel (once ignited) but are limited by Al cost; they are used chiefly for specialty alloys and account for a minor (~5–10%) fraction of global Mg.  

**Electrolytic Dow process** (MgCl₂ cell) is the other major route. It electrolyzes molten anhydrous MgCl₂ (often from dehydrated brine-derived MgCl₂) at ~700–750 °C with additional eutectic chlorides, producing Mg at the cathode and Cl₂ gas at the anode. This yields very high-purity Mg (≥99.8%) and generates large volumes of Cl₂. Energy requirements are on the order of 12–18 MWh per tonne Mg. The process is well understood (US Magnesium in Utah uses it), but currently China builds most large electrolysis plants when coal-generated electricity is cheap (e.g. Shanxi). The MgO source must be dehydrated MgCl₂ (anhydrous), typically via chemical or vacuum dehydration from bitterns or carnallite.  

**Molten salt and novel processes** are under development. One approach is direct MgO electrolysis: suspending or dissolving MgO (or MgO/CaO mix) in a molten chloride (such as CaCl₂-based electrolytes) at 800–900 °C and electrolyzing. The FFC Cambridge process (originally for Ti) has been applied experimentally to MgO-derived reagents. These methods could eliminate a chemical conversion step, but face challenges of electrolyte management and inert anodes. Other ideas include carbothermic reduction (using coke or biomass to reduce MgO under vacuum) and hybrid routes combining pre-reduction (e.g. CaC₂) then melt processes. Carbothermic Mg reduction requires ~2300 °C (very high) and is not commercial yet. In summary, outside of Pidgeon, aluminothermic, and electrolysis, no major new commercial primary routes exist. Research is aimed at lowering temperature and shifting to renewables (e.g. electrolyzers with inert anodes, or silicothermic processes paired with renewable hydrogen/biogas to provide heat).  

## Key Separation Technologies  
*Summary: Vapor condensation; vacuum separation; slag removal; crystallization; centrifugation*  

After high-temperature reduction or electrolysis, crude Mg metal must be separated from impurities and slag. In thermal processes, **vapor condensation** is primary: Mg metal boils at 1090 °C and re-condenses around 500 °C on relatively cool surfaces (condensers) under vacuum ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351199870_Magnesium_Smelting_via_the_Pidgeon_Process#:~:text=generating%20furnace%20as%20fuel,to%201150%E2%80%931200%20%C2%B0C%2C%20the%20pellets275)). The temperature gradient causes Mg vapor to nucleate as metal rods or flakes, while non-volatile oxides/silicates (MgO/CaO/SiO₂ slag) remain behind. The solidified magnesium (typically 95–99% pure) is then mechanically separated from the calciumsilicate (CaSiO₃) or calcia-fluorite slag. Simple density sorting or manual collection yields the metal.  

**Vacuum refining (distillation)** further purifies the crude Mg if higher grade is needed. Under vacuum (~0.1–10 Pa) and ∼650–750 °C, residual impurities (Fe, Si, Ni, etc. with higher boiling points) stay in the melt while Mg vaporizes again. The purified Mg is re-condensed on new cooled surfaces as ultra-high-purity ingot (99.99+%). This two-stage distillation is routine for aerospace- and semiconductor-grade Mg.  

**Crystallization and filtration** are used for electrolytic metal. Molten Mg is often treated with cover salts (e.g. MgCl₂–KCl flux) and inert gas to clean oxide and dross. Controlled cooling (fractional crystallization) or flux filtration helps exclude inclusions and segregate metal ingots. High-speed **centrifugation** of liquid Mg (as in spin-casting) can also cast out dross and produce clean castings.  

**Electrolytic refining** (three-layer cells) has been demonstrated for Mg, using a molten Mg anode, mixed chloride electrolyte, and pure Mg cathode. In such cells, impurities sink to the bottom, yielding Mg cathode deposit up to 6N purity. However, this is not widely used industrially due to complexity; vacuum distillation remains the principal route to 4–6N Mg.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
*Summary: Vacuum distillation; flux refining; zone refining; sublimation; electrolytic polishing*  

For ultra-high-purity needs (semiconductors, specialty alloys), further steps are applied. **High-vacuum multi-stage distillation** is key: single or multi-column vacuum furnaces (<1 Pa, 600–700 °C) can produce Mg at 99.999–99.9999% (4–6N) purity. Impurities (as ppm levels) are distributed into fractionation residues ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/1/85#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20vacuum%20distillation%20is%20still,Before%20introducing%20different)). Lab methods (e.g. horizontal retort distillers, monocrystalline condensers) can achieve “6N” (99.9999%) purity by repeated passes. (Notably, values excluding zinc have been reported at ~6N purity on second pass ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/9/1/85#:~:text=match%20at%20L418%20with%20an,zinc%20in%20the%20final%20material)).) 

**Remelting with fluxes and filtration** is common for 5N purity alloys. Mg ingots are melted and treated with chloride-based flux (MgCl₂–KCl) under argon or SF₆, which dissolves oxides. While molten, ceramic foam filters (or electromagnetic stirring and Sedimentation) remove dross. This yields high-purity ingots for aerospace.  For parts production, alloys may also be refined via vacuum treatments (similar to metal in ingot form, further vacuum-heated to off-gas impurities). 

**Zone refining and sublimation** are special lab-scale processes. In zone refining (a narrow molten zone traveling along an ingot), impurities concentrate at one end, enabling attainment of 6N+ Mg but only at small scale (kg-size). **Sublimation under ultrahigh vacuum** (e.g. <10⁻⁴ Pa) at lower temperature (~400–500 °C) has been used to produce research-grade “7N” pure Mg by direct solid–vapor–condense, but is impractical for bulk. Similarly, “electrolytic polishing” uses molten-metal electrodes to yield 5N–6N Mg wire or flakes (analogous to aluminum anodic casting). These niche methods illustrate the potential but are not large-scale.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
*Summary: pH neutralization; slag recycling; gas scrubbing; dust control; brine management*  

Magnesium production can generate corrosive or hazardous effluents that require treatment. **Effluent neutralization:** Waste brines or wash waters high in Mg²⁺ can be treated by adding lime (Ca(OH)₂). This precipitates Mg(OH)₂ once pH ~10–11 is reached, allowing filtration. The Mg hydroxide sludge (or its carbonated form, magnesite) can sometimes be recycled as raw material or used for CO₂ sequestration (since forming MgCO₃ captures CO₂).  

**Slag reuse:** Ex-situ environmental control of Pidgeon slag is common. The calcium silicate slag (pH ~11–12) has cementitious properties and can be crushed for use as a soil amendment or concrete additive (since it is rich in CaO and MgO). Research-level processes have also been proposed to recover remaining Mg or Al from slags. Aluminate- or silica-rich secondary slags can sometimes be leached or processed for metals recovery.  

**Gas scrubbing:** Off-gas streams from electrolytic smelters contain Cl₂ and/or HCl. Chlorine can be absorbed in caustic scrubbers to make hypochlorite or HCl (used in industry) with >99% efficiency. Sulfur emissions (from MgCl₂ hydrates or fluxes) are captured by limestone wet scrubbers forming gypsum. Electrolytic fluxes may also emit HF or F₂, which are trapped with dry alumina pack beds. Pidgeon furnaces emit very little gas beyond steam/CO₂ if properly sealed, but any particulates are caught by fabric filters (99.9% capture) or wet scrubbers. **Dust control:** Baghouse filters or electrostatic precipitators remove MgO/Mg(OH)₂ dust and fume from kilns and vacuum retorts, allowing reuse in processes or safe disposal.  

**Brine management:** In brine operation (e.g. Great Salt Lake harvesting), a series of ponds sequentially evaporate out NaCl, KCl, etc., with Mg-rich bittern collected at end. Solid salts are removed (sometimes sold). The residual Mg-concentrated liquid is either further evaporated or sometimes reinjected to avoid fluid discharge. Strict zero-liquid-discharge (ZLD) practices are now encouraged in mature operations: for example, crystallizers recover NaCl/KCl fully, and remaining brine (Mg-depleted) may be returned to the natural source (lake) within permit limits. In short, ZLD or near-ZLD systems isolate magnesium production from water pollution.  

## Key Bottleneck summary  
The overarching constraint remains the **enormous energy demand and carbon emissions of primary Mg extraction**. Current processes consume on the order of 30–40 MWh per tonne (Pidgeon) or 12–18 MWh per tonne (electrolysis) and, when powered by fossil fuels, emit on the order of 20–25 t CO₂ per tonne Mg ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276852841_Updated_CO2_emission_from_Mg_production_by_Pidgeon_process_Implications_for_automotive_application_life_cycle#:~:text=coke%2Fsemi,applied%20in%20a%20generic%20car)). Reducing this energy/emissions burden is essential: only by replacing coal/thermal inputs with renewable electricity (in electrolysis) or finding radically lower-temperature or non-carbon reductants can Western production be economical and low-carbon. Until such breakthroughs are commercialized, U.S. and allied supply will remain limited by this fundamental bottleneck.veedores("");
