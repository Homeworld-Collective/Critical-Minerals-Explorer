## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
• **United States:**  US barite output is concentrated in Nevada and processed mainly for oilfield mud.  In 2012 Nevada mines (Halliburton’s Rossi, Baker Hughes/CIMBAR’s Argenta, NOV’s Big Ledge, and M-I Swaco’s Greystone) shipped about 811 kt ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Production%20of%20the%20innocuous%20gray,697%2C946%20tons%20shipped%20in%202011)).  M-I Swaco (Schlumberger) alone sent 317,241 t from Nevada’s Greystone mine in 2013 ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=M,from%20the%20plant%20in%202013)).  US crushers and grinders sold ~2.6 Mt in 2013 ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=production%2C%20the%20U,customers%2C%20the%20USGS%20reports)).  In 2022, US ground/crushed barite totaled ~2.10 Mt ([m.3gcj.com](https://m.3gcj.com/baogao/1037973.html#:~:text=221%E3%80%81ltrapure%20barite%20is%20used%20as,2%2C100%20Imports%20for%20consumption2%202%2C4)).  Major domestic processors include Baker Hughes/CIMBAR (grinding plants in Ohio and Texas), Halliburton (Rossi mine and Dunphy mill, NV), Schlumberger (Battle Mountain mill, NV), and NOV (Wells, NV jig plant) ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Four%20companies%20have%20a%20presence,and%20a%20mill%20in%20Dunphy)) ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/cimbar-opens-new-us-barite-plant-acquires-ath-plant/#:~:text=The%20new%20plant%E2%80%99s%20main%20product,5m)).  Nearly all US barite (90–95%) is used as an oil/gas well-drilling fluid weighting agent ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/page/barite-weighs-in-on-critical-minerals-list/5753.html#:~:text=,report%2C%20Mineral%20Commodity%20Summaries%202018)) ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Ninety,control%20gas%20and%20water%20pressures)).  (Note: total US consumption was ~3.0 Mt in 2017 ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/page/barite-weighs-in-on-critical-minerals-list/5753.html#:~:text=While%20the%20U,States%20last%20year%20was%20imported)), so domestic production is a fraction and net import reliance ≈75% ([m.3gcj.com](https://m.3gcj.com/baogao/1037973.html#:~:text=value%2Cground%2Cex,a%20percentage%20of%20apparent%20consu)).)  

• **Canada:**  Four barite mines operate in Canada (two in British Columbia, one in Ontario, one in Nova Scotia) producing drilling-, pigment-, and pharmaceutical-grade barite ([www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/barite#:~:text=The%20major%20grades%20of%20barite,for%20pharmaceuticals)).  Combined annual output is modest (tens of kt).  Companies (e.g. Bisley Pty in Australia also markets to U.S./Canada) supply domestic oilfield and industrial users, but Canada still imports significant volume for drilling needs. No recent comprehensive production data is published.  

• **Australia:**  Australia has small barite operations (e.g. micronized barite supplied by local mining companies), but production is minor (<0.1 Mt/yr) compared to global leaders.  Domestic use in drilling and specialty bins is limited, and much Australian barite is exported.  

• **EU, Norway, Iceland:**  Europe and Norway have very limited barite output.  Historic producers (Spain, southeastern Europe) are few and nearly all barite must be imported.  Norway’s offshore industry uses barite shipped in.  Iceland has no known barite mines.  

• **Japan:**  Essentially no domestic barite mining; Japan is fully import-dependent (mostly from China/India).  Use is limited to fills and shielding.  

• **Global context:**  Allied countries collectively constitute a small share of world barite production.  For perspective, ~77% of global supply comes from China, India, Morocco, and Mexico ([imformed.com](https://imformed.com/cimbar-opens-new-us-barite-plant-acquires-ath-plant/#:~:text=As%20can%20be%20seen%20in,by%20India%2C%20Morocco%2C%20and%20Mexico)), highlighting the relative paucity of US/allied output.

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
• **O&G drilling (oil & gas):**  Continued growth in drilling activity will chiefly drive barite demand.  Barite’s dominant market (≈75–90%) is as a drilling-fluid weighting agent ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/page/barite-weighs-in-on-critical-minerals-list/5753.html#:~:text=,report%2C%20Mineral%20Commodity%20Summaries%202018)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=,oil%20%26%20gas%20producers%20in)).  Research and Markets projects global barite market to expand at ~5.1 % CAGR through 2030 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=The%20global%20barite%20market%20size,over%20the%20forecast%20period)), driven by oil/gas exploration.  In 2022 North America (US+Canada) commanded ~40% of the market revenue ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=in%202022,demand%20high%20in%20the%20region)).  Thus US/allied drilling demand may rise toward ∼4–5 Mt/yr by 2030 (up from ~3 Mt today ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/page/barite-weighs-in-on-critical-minerals-list/5753.html#:~:text=While%20the%20U,States%20last%20year%20was%20imported)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=The%20global%20barite%20market%20size,over%20the%20forecast%20period))).  This assumes steady rig counts and continued offshore/onshore drilling.  

• **Industrial uses:**  Secondary markets include high-density concrete (radiation shielding), paints/plastics extenders, rubber and brake-linings.  Allied industrial demand is smaller but growing; for example, barite use in medical X-ray/CT applications (contrast medium) is increasing.  Forecasts suggest the chemical & filler applications will grow (∼5% CAGR ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=The%20global%20barite%20market%20size,over%20the%20forecast%20period)) ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=,are%20propelling%20product%20demand))).  By 2030, allied non-O&G demand (fills, chemicals, etc.) might add a few hundred kilotons to the total.  

• **Combined allied demand:**  Summing US consumption with allied needs (Canada phosphorous industry, Australia mining, EU construction) indicates US+allied demand on the order of ~5–6 Mt/yr by 2030, though precise figures vary by scenario.  (Roughly, global market $2.13B by 2030 ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=The%20global%20barite%20market%20size,over%20the%20forecast%20period)) at ~$170/t is ~12.5 Mt; 40% of that is ~5 Mt US/North America.)  In summary, US/allied markets will remain in the multi-million-ton range in 2030, with oilfield drilling the overwhelming driver ([www.globenewswire.com](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/07/05/2699369/0/en/Global-Barite-Market-2023-to-2030-Increasing-Investments-in-the-Oil-Gas-Sector-Drives-Growth.html#:~:text=,oil%20%26%20gas%20producers%20in)) ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/page/barite-weighs-in-on-critical-minerals-list/5753.html#:~:text=,report%2C%20Mineral%20Commodity%20Summaries%202018)).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
• **Domestic production forecast:**  Barring major new discoveries, domestic supply growth is modest.  The only significant potential project is Constantine Metals’ Palmer (Alaska) zinc-copper mine, which would co-produce barite (PEA: 2.89 Mt over 11 yr, ~0.26 Mt/yr) ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=%2A%2012.48%20million%20tonnes%20%28,of%20the%20critical%20mineral%20barite)).  If advanced by 2030, that could be a new US source.  Nevada production is expected to continue at current levels; Halliburton’s planned expansion of the Rossi mine (approved via BLM permits) would extend life and output of its existing open pits ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Halliburton%20has%20plans%20on%20file,the%20Rossi%20mine%20since%201947)).  No large new barite mines are known in US or allied states beyond ongoing drills.  Thus projected US/allied mined supply by 2030 likely ranges under 1 Mt/yr from domestic sites (Palmer + NV + small Canada) – i.e. only a fraction of demand.  

• **Imports and allied sources:**  To meet excess demand, the US and allies will still rely heavily on imported barite.  Current import sources (China, India, Mexico, Morocco) will likely remain important.  Allied suppliers (e.g. Australia) also import some foreign barite.  In summary, US/allied supply in 2030 will be dominated by these existing domestic sources (Nevada mines, any Palmer output) plus imports.  Domestic share will remain well under consumption.

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Geologic mapping & geochemistry:**  Traditional field mapping to identify barite-bearing lithologies (Mississippi-Valley type carbonates, exhalative-sedimentary horizons, hydrothermal veins) remains primary.  Geochemical sampling (rock/soil/stream assays for Ba, Sr, Pb-Zn pathfinders) highlights anomalies.  For example, advanced sampling delineated the high-grade barite zone at Alaska’s Palmer VMS deposit ([www.miningnewsnorth.com](https://www.miningnewsnorth.com/page/barite-weighs-in-on-critical-minerals-list/5753.html#:~:text=According%20to%20a%20resource%20calculated,12%20million%20metric%20tons)).  
• **Airborne surveys:**  Gravity surveys can detect dense mineralized layers, and airborne gamma-ray radiometrics may pick up any associated U/Th. These help outline barite horizons (though barite itself is non-radioactive, it can co-occur with radioactive elements).  
• **Electrical geophysics:**  Resistivity/VES methods can map barite veins in conductive host rocks.  Nigerian studies used vertical electrical soundings and horizontal resistivity profiles to locate concealed barite veins ~10–40 m deep ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332543245_Reserve_Estimation_of_Barite_Deposits_using_Geological_and_Geophysical_Investigations_in_Cross_River_State_South_Eastern_Nigeria#:~:text=Barite%20deposits%20occur%20mostly%20as,horizontal%20resistivity%20profiling%20results%2C%20and)).  
• **Drilling and downhole techniques:**  Core drilling with quantitative XRF or portable gamma logging can confirm barium-rich zones.  Exploratory drillholes (e.g. the Palmer coring) provide grade data. Downhole tools (e.g. density logging) might also identify high-SG veins.  
• **Remote sensing:**  Hyperspectral and satellite imagery may aid in regional targeting (e.g. mapping Ba-bearing alteration minerals).  In frontier settings, marine seismic/ROV exploration is being considered: recent evaluations suggest seawater barite blankets (“chemogenic” deposits) on ocean floors as novel targets ([www.researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375629657_World%27s_barite_resources_as_critical_raw_material#:~:text=Iran%2C%20Laos%2C%20Mexico%2C%20Pakistan%2C%20Bulgaria,including%20chemogenic%20marine%20bottom%20sediments)).

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-pit mining:**  Predominant for near-surface barite (low overburden).  Large shovels and haul trucks are used to mine from benches, as at Nevada’s Rossi mine ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Halliburton%20has%20plans%20on%20file,the%20Rossi%20mine%20since%201947)). Conventional drill-and-blast breaks ore for loading. Some US mining has been done by contractor draglines and loaders in open pits.  
• **Underground mining:**  For deeper or high-grade veins, room-and-pillar or longhole stoping is applied.  The planned Palmer (AK) operation, for instance, would use longhole sublevel stoping with ore passes and an underground crusher to yield 3,500 t/d throughput ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=This%20PEA%20models%20concurrent%20mining,potentially%20acid%20generating%20and%20will)).  Levels and declines give access to barite-rich zones in sulfide deposits.  
• **Bulk blasting advancements:**  Controlled blasting (e.g. electronic detonators) improves fragmentation of brittle barite ore, enhancing efficiency in both open and underground mines.  
• **Byproduct/co-product mining:**  Many barite deposits occur with base-metal ores (Zn-Pb).  Technologies from base-metal mining (gravity tables, flotation, etc.) are adapted at such mines to recover barite concentrates as coproduct (see Palmer example ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=This%20PEA%20models%20concurrent%20mining,potentially%20acid%20generating%20and%20will))).  
• **Material handling:**  High-capacity conveyors and dense-phase pneumatic systems move barite ore; heavy-duty screens grind lumps to < ~3".  Due to barite’s high SG (~4.5), specialized belt feeders and pumps are used in processing plants to handle the dense slurry.  

_(Examples: Halliburton’s long-time open-pit operations at Rossi ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Halliburton%20has%20plans%20on%20file,the%20Rossi%20mine%20since%201947)); Constantine PEA longhole plan in Alaska ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=This%20PEA%20models%20concurrent%20mining,potentially%20acid%20generating%20and%20will)).)_  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Crushing & grinding:**  Ore is crushed (jaw, cone crushers) and milled (ball/rod mills) to liberate barite.  The goal is API-specified fineness (~200 mesh). Gravity-flow shredders and rod mills are also used. For instance, the Palmer PEA envisaged multi-stage grinding to separate zinc, copper, and barite produces ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=%2A%2012.48%20million%20tonnes%20%28,of%20the%20critical%20mineral%20barite)).  
• **Gravity separation:**  The workhorse for coarse barite.  High-density media cyclones (dense-medium separation) exploit BaSO₄’s ~4.2 SG: barite sinks, gangue floats.  Jigs and shaking tables separate based on density; spiral chutes further refine fines.  These gravity circuits yield 4.2+ SG concentrate.  (Common equipment: heavy-media cyclones, Wilfley tables, spirals) ([www.xinhaimining.com](https://www.xinhaimining.com/newp/choose-optimal-barite-processing-equipment.html#:~:text=The%20barite%20gravity%20separation%20method,Commonly%20used%20equipment%20includes)) ([www.xinhaimining.com](https://www.xinhaimining.com/newp/choose-optimal-barite-processing-equipment.html#:~:text=4)).  
• **Flotation:**  Used primarily for fine ore or when gangue is silica/clay.  Barite has intrinsic floatability; appropriate collectors (e.g. fatty acids) allow recovery of sub-2 mm particles.  Flotation cells (mechanical agitators) can scrub and float barite ahead of clay and silicate impurities ([www.xinhaimining.com](https://www.xinhaimining.com/newp/choose-optimal-barite-processing-equipment.html#:~:text=07Flotation%20equipment%C2%A0for%20barite%20processing)).  Multi-stage flotation cleans up the concentrate, especially for sedimentary ores.  
• **Hand and sensor-based sorting:**  High-grade lump barite (30–150 mm) may be separated by hand (density pickers) or with X-ray/optical sorters, separating it from host rock.  (Hand sorting is practical for super-high-grade ore >92% BaSO₄ ([www.xinhaimining.com](https://www.xinhaimining.com/newp/choose-optimal-barite-processing-equipment.html#:~:text=05Barite%20Hand%20Selection%20Equipment)).)  
• **Magnetic separation:**  Barite itself is non-magnetic, but HI-MAG separators can remove iron sulfide impurities.  This step is rarely a main separation for barite but can polish concentrate purity.  
• **Dense-medium cycloning:**  Beyond jigs, modern plants use heavy-media cyclones (suspension of ferrosilicon or magnetite) to finely separate barite by density ([www.xinhaimining.com](https://www.xinhaimining.com/newp/choose-optimal-barite-processing-equipment.html#:~:text=4)).  This is especially valuable for large-scale, continuous separation.

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Acid leaching:**  Barite concentrates often undergo dilute acid (HCl or H₂SO₄) washing to dissolve carbonate (dolomite/calcite) gangue.  This raises barium sulfate purity and SG. For example, treating crude barite with hydrochloric acid removes minor carbonates without attacking BaSO₄.  
• **Fluid/chemical bleaching:**  To remove organics or trace iron, oxidizing agents (H₂O₂) or surfactant washes whiten the powder.  High-grade ‘medical’ barium sulfate is sometimes recrystallized from barium carbonate, but bulk drilling grade is purified by physical/chemical washing.  
• **Regrinding and recleaning:**  Multistage milling with finer grinding and additional gravity/flotation passes ensures meeting API 13A specs (SG≥4.2, low salt/clay).  In practice, concentrates are reground and passed through jigs or cyclones again for spec compliance.  
• **Creasing dryness and sizing:**  Final filters/dryers remove moisture.  The powder is then sieved into product-size fractions (API drilling grade typically 97% <74 µm).  Packaging into sacks or bulk shifts follows.  
• **Metallurgical finishing:**  For specialty grades (e.g. microfine for pigments), wet-milling to 10–50 µm plus chemical additives (dispersants) may be applied.

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Dry-stack tailings:**  Filtering tailings into a dewatered cake for dry storage (minimizing ponded water) is increasingly used.  Constantine’s Palmer plan, for example, employs filtered (dry) tailings and underground backfill so that no liquid tailings dam is needed ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=This%20PEA%20models%20concurrent%20mining,potentially%20acid%20generating%20and%20will)).  
• **Backfill:**  Stable waste (non-acid-generating) or processed sulfide (pyrite concentrate) can be returned underground as structural backfill (as planned at Palmer ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=This%20PEA%20models%20concurrent%20mining,potentially%20acid%20generating%20and%20will))).  This reduces surface tailings volume and prevents acid drainage.  
• **Erosion control and revegetation:**  Pit walls and waste dumps are contoured and covered with topsoil or hydroseed to prevent runoff.  Local grasses and shrubs are planted for slope stabilization (common practice at Nevada mines).  
• **Dust suppression:**  Water sprays, chemical dust palliatives, and paved haul roads mitigate fugitive dust.  Maintaining wet conveyors and enclosed transfer points prevents silica dust.  
• **Water treatment:**  Any contact water (from dewatering) is settled/neutralized before discharge.  Barite mines produce minimal acid drainage (BaSO₄ is insoluble), but pH is buffered if needed.  
• **Mine reclamation:**  After closure, long-term monitoring of the site (subsidence, vegetation) is carried out under regulatory oversight.  Facilities are dismantled or repurposed (e.g. Halliburton relocated roads for Rossi expansion ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Halliburton%20has%20plans%20on%20file,the%20Rossi%20mine%20since%201947))).

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The chief bottleneck lies in large-scale beneficiation: reaching API-grade purity from domestic ores.  Many US barite deposits (and allied sources) have minerals mixed with silica/clay, yielding specific gravity slightly below the 4.2 API standard.  Efficient dense-media separation and fine grinding circuits are therefore critical – yet building that processing capacity is costly and time-consuming.  Halliburton explicitly noted that expanding its Nevada operations was “needed…to decrease dependence on foreign supplies” ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Halliburton%20says%20the%20expansion%20is,years%20in%20current%20market%20conditions)). This implies that without additional heavy-media cyclones, mills, or chemical leaches on a commercial scale, domestic mines cannot fully exploit their resources. In short, upgrading low-grade barite ore to exportable spec is the key technical constraint on US/allied production.

## Key Bottleneck summary (2-4 sentences)  
US and allied barite production is currently limited by processing capacity rather than geology.  Even though sizable deposits exist (e.g. 2.89 Mt at Palmer ([www.juniorminingnetwork.com](https://www.juniorminingnetwork.com/junior-miner-news/press-releases/1213-tsx-venture/cem/62716-constantine-releases-positive-preliminary-economic-assessment-for-palmer-zinc-copper-silver-gold-project-southeast-alaska-post-tax-npv-of-us-266-million.html#:~:text=%2A%2012.48%20million%20tonnes%20%28,of%20the%20critical%20mineral%20barite))), there isn’t yet sufficient domestic infrastructure (mills, heavy-media plants) to upgrade ore to API spec.  As Halliburton’s expansion plan underscores, the U.S. must invest in grinding and separation facilities to tap these resources and cut import dependence ([www.nnbw.com](https://www.nnbw.com/news/2014/jun/23/barite-mining-grows-with-oil-drilling-boom/#:~:text=Halliburton%20says%20the%20expansion%20is,years%20in%20current%20market%20conditions)). In essence, without enhanced beneficiation (densification and purification) technologies deployed at scale, domestic barite output will remain a fraction of rising demand.
