## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production
*Summary: Solvent extraction separation capacity; metal/alloy production; magnet manufacturing*

The **primary bottleneck** is the lack of large-scale SX separation plants in the West.  China controls the vast majority of global REE processing – on the order of ~90% of separation/refining ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=While%20China%20accounts%20for%20approximately,REEs%20globally%20and%20consolidate%20midstream)) – and likewise dominates rare-earth alloy and magnet output ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/rare-earth-magnet-production-outside-china-recently-investor-briefing/#:~:text=magnet%E2%80%9D%20alliances%20to%20secure%20critical,added%20urgency%20to%20Western%20diversification)). Western mines can produce mixed REE concentrates, but the critical separation (especially isolating Sm from Nd or other lanthanides) remains almost entirely Chinese. 

Specific challenges include:  
- **Separation complexity:**  Lanthanides have very similar chemistry, yielding low adjacent-element separation factors (∼2–3) in SX; dozens of mixer-settler stages are typically needed for 99.9% purity ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=More%20recently%2C%20in%202023%2C%20it,these%20projects%20require%20substantial%20time)). For example, Sm must be separated from Nd under mildly acidic conditions and this requires many countercurrent stages due to the small Sm/Nd distribution coefficient difference ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=More%20recently%2C%20in%202023%2C%20it,these%20projects%20require%20substantial%20time)).  
- **Capital intensity:**  Recent project costings illustrate extremely high capex.  Avalon’s 10,000-t/yr REO separation plant (Nevada) was estimated at about US$302 million ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/avalons-rare-earth-separation-plant-in-louisiana-to-cost-302-million/#:~:text=%3E%20SNC,96)).  Likewise, Lynas has reported that its 9,000-t/yr Kalgoorlie facility will cost ~A$730 million (≈US$480 M) ([newsletter.en.creamermedia.com](https://newsletter.en.creamermedia.com/article/lynas-unveil-cost-increases-at-kalgoorlie-2023-08-29#:~:text=Lynas%20CEO%20and%20MD%20Amanda,million%20estimated%20last%20year)).  Even a 1,000-t scale plant would likely be well over US$100M, given reagent, equipment and environmental controls.  
- **Technical expertise:** Western companies have only limited experience with industrial-scale lanthanide SX ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=More%20recently%2C%20in%202023%2C%20it,these%20projects%20require%20substantial%20time)).  China’s decades of focus have produced seasoned engineers and chemists; by contrast, few Western engineers have operated REE SX at scale, and know-how must be rebuilt from university and lab experience ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=More%20recently%2C%20in%202023%2C%20it,these%20projects%20require%20substantial%20time)).  
- **Environmental permitting:**  REE SX uses organic solvents and strong acids, triggering lengthy regulatory reviews.  US projects (even small plants like Rare Element’s demonstration) have required multi-year NEPA/EIS processes.  Delays of 3–5 years for full permitting and environmental approval are typical for midstream REE facilities.  
- **Reagent supply chains:**  Critical extractants (e.g. D2EHPA or Cyanex 272) and high-purity mineral acids are mostly produced by few specialty chemical firms (often outside the U.S.).  Securing a reliable Western supply chain for these reagents is nontrivial in the short term.  

Notably, MP Materials at Mountain Pass only began shipping separated NdPr oxide in 2023 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)), and currently produces essentially no separated Sm or other oxides.  Lynas Rare Earths’ Mt Weld mine produces carbonate feedstocks that *must* still be sent to Malaysia (and soon Japan) for separation ([www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com%2C2023%3Anewsml_L4N3D14MF%3A0-lynas-s-kalgoorlie-processing-plant-receives-first-rare-earths-feed/#:~:text=The%20mixed%20rare,March%20quarter%2C%20the%20company%20said)).  The Canadian SRC facility is only a pilot (10 t/month of NdPr metal capacity ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024))).  To our knowledge no Western plant currently makes >100 t/yr of separated Sm₂O₃.  Likewise, there is no indigenous Samarium metal smelting beyond small pilot work, and SmCo magnet production is only nascent (formerly just small firms like Elektron Energy in the US or vacuum induction companies in Europe) ([rareearthexchanges.com](https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/rare-earth-magnet-production-outside-china-recently-investor-briefing/#:~:text=magnet%E2%80%9D%20alliances%20to%20secure%20critical,added%20urgency%20to%20Western%20diversification)).  Finally, Western ores often carry thorium/uranium (e.g. in monazite) requiring new disposal capacity. 

**Bottleneck summary:**  In sum, the lack of midstream separation is the chokepoint.  Western mines are expanding (see below), but without $100s of millions in new SX/refining plants (and years of development), concentrate output must still go abroad.  Building multiple 5,000–10,000 t/yr SX lines (each $\sim$hundreds MM USD) and training staff would easily require \$1–2 billion total and 5–7 years lead time.  Until then, allied Sm (and other REEs) output will remain hostage to Chinese processing ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=While%20China%20accounts%20for%20approximately,REEs%20globally%20and%20consolidate%20midstream)) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)), regardless of mining production.  

## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)
*Summary: 1,140–1,610 tons Sm₂O₃ content in concentrates annually (2024)*

- **USA – Mountain Pass (CA):**  MP Materials produced a record ~45,455 t of REO in concentrate in 2024 ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)).  Bastnäsite concentrate at Mountain Pass contains only small fractions of each REE; Sm₂O₃ is roughly 2–3% of the REO by weight.  Thus MP’s 2024 output (~45.5 kt REO) implies on the order of 900–1,360 t of Sm₂O₃ in *concentrate form*.  (All of this has been sold as concentrate or NdPr alloy, not separated Sm.)  The U.S. has essentially no other significant REE mining.  

- **Australia – Mt Weld (Lynas):**  Lynas Rare Earths produced ~16,780 t REO in FY2023 (July 2022–June 2023) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)).  Mt Weld ore is bastnäsite-rich, with Samarium around 2.0–2.3% of total REO.  Therefore Australasia’s 2023 Sm₂O₃ content was about 335–385 t.  (The Browns Range mine (heavy-REE garnet) was under care-and-maintenance in 2024, so contributed essentially zero.)  Lynas still must ship Mt Weld concentrate to its Kalgoorlie plant and/or Malaysia for further processing ([www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters.com%2C2023%3Anewsml_L4N3D14MF%3A0-lynas-s-kalgoorlie-processing-plant-receives-first-rare-earths-feed/#:~:text=The%20mixed%20rare,March%20quarter%2C%20the%20company%20said)).  Other Australian projects are coming: Iluka’s Eneabba plant (to start ~2026) will add separated output, and Arafura’s planned Nolans project (Qld) is designed for 4.44 kt REO (≈90 t Sm₂O₃) per year.  

- **Canada (export-oriented):**  Canada has almost no current REE production.  Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (N.W.T.) mine briefly shipped demonstration-scale bastnäsite concentrate in 2021–23, but operations halted (bankruptcy of the processor) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/study-suggests-vital-metals-as-large-ree-producer/#:~:text=Nechalacho%20was%20briefly%20Canada%E2%80%99s%20first,processing%20subsidiary%20in%20Saskatoon%2C%20Saskatchewan)).  Vital is planning to scale up (Tardiff zone) – a recent study projects ~56,000 t of concentrate per year (with Sm content ~3%) ([www.mining.com](https://www.mining.com/study-suggests-vital-metals-as-large-ree-producer/#:~:text=Tardiff%E2%80%99s%20output%20would%20yield%20about,of%20the%20global%20total)) – but this is future.  Thus as of 2024 Canada’s Sm supply is essentially zero (beyond small pilot and recycling).  A domestic NdPr separation line is being tested at Saskatchewan Research Council (Saskatoon), but it is only at demonstration scale (10 t/mo NdPr) ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024)) and does not yet separate samarium.  Search Minerals’ Foxtrot project (Newfoundland/Labrador) and others are early-stage.  

- **EU/Norway:**  At present no commercial REE mining occurs in Europe.  Norway’s undeveloped Fen carbonatite contains a huge resource (559 Mt ore at 1.57% TREO ≈8.8 Mt TREO ([rareearthsnorway.com](https://rareearthsnorway.com/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-elements-discovered-at-fen-norway/#:~:text=The%20Maiden%20Inferred%20Mineral%20Resource%2C,materials%20when%20considering%20supply%20risk))), but no production.  Sweden’s Norra Kärr (heavy-REE ionic deposit) is under permitting only.  Thus current *European* samarium output is essentially zero.  

- **Japan:**  Japan has no REE mines and relies almost entirely on imports (historically >90% from China) ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/10/japan-rare-earth-minerals/#:~:text=The%20embargo%20sent%20Japanese%20industry,a%20year%20following%20the%20incident)).  Domestic samarium comes only via recycled magnets or converted intermediates.  

**Summary:**  In sum, allied Sm₂O₃ in concentrates today is on the order of 1.1–1.6 kt/yr: roughly 900–1,360 t from Mountain Pass and 335–385 t from Lynas (FY2023 levels) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)).  After blending and mineral losses, this aligns with ~1.14–1.61 kt of Sm₂O₃ content.  Note that almost none of this output is separated Sm oxide; it is shipped as mixed concentrate (mainly to China/Malaysia).  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)
*Summary: ≥940–1,175 tons Sm₂O₃ annually by 2030 (aligned with defense and industrial needs)*

Looking forward, allied samarium demand will be driven by Sm–Co permanent magnets for high-temperature military and aerospace systems, supplemented by niche uses (nuclear control rods, specialized catalysts/ceramics).  The **global permanent magnet market** is expected to exceed ~$51 billion by 2030 ([www.gminsights.com](https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/permanent-magnet-market#:~:text=Permanent%20Magnet%20Market%20size%20to,USD%2051%20billion%20by%202030)), and while NdFeB dominates (~90%+), SmCo magnets fill critical niches.  SmCo₅ magnets contain roughly 36% Sm by weight, Sm₂Co₁₇ about 25% Sm – far higher than NdFeB. ([www.gminsights.com](https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/permanent-magnet-market#:~:text=Permanent%20Magnet%20Market%20size%20to,USD%2051%20billion%20by%202030))  Even a few thousand tons of SmCo magnets implies hundreds of tons of samarium.  For example, 2,500 t of SmCo magnets (at ~35% Sm) would require ~875 t Sm metal (≈1,000 t Sm₂O₃). 

Quantitatively, estimates vary.  If Western defense/aerospace programs collectively required on the order of 2–3 kt of SmCo magnets per year by 2030 (to equip new aircraft, missiles, etc.), that could translate to ~750–1,050 t of Sm metal (≈870–1,220 t Sm₂O₃).  Japan’s 2010 REE crisis saw it 90% import-dependent ([www.weforum.org](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/10/japan-rare-earth-minerals/#:~:text=The%20embargo%20sent%20Japanese%20industry,a%20year%20following%20the%20incident)), illustrating how little domestic Sm was available.  Nuclear reactor control rods use samarium (Sm-149) as a burnable poison, but even 100+ reactors globally consume only a few tens of tonnes of Sm₂O₃ per year (burnup replacing ~20–30 t Sm₂O₃/yr worldwide).  Other industrial uses (NASA glass polishing, catalysts, specialty alloys) are smaller scale (probably a few 10s of tonnes of Sm₂O₃ annually). 

Putting these together, a **ballpark allied Sm₂O₃ demand by 2030** is on the order of 0.9–1.2 kt/yr in a baseline scenario, with upside to ~1.3–1.5 kt/yr if new defense programs accelerate.  (For context, USGS projects global REE demand growing after 2025, driven by EVs and wind magnets among others.) ([www.gminsights.com](https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/permanent-magnet-market#:~:text=Permanent%20Magnet%20Market%20size%20to,USD%2051%20billion%20by%202030))  This far exceeds current Western separated output, underscoring the need for new supply chains.  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)
*Summary: Several kilotons Sm₂O₃ content in concentrate; <2 kt separated without major new refineries*

By 2030 allied Sm availability will depend on ramp-ups at existing mines and new projects, plus nascent processing facilities:

- **USA:** Mountain Pass is expected to hold at ~45–50 kt/yr REO output ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)).  If fully captured, this could yield ~900–1,500 t Sm₂O₃ content.  MP Materials is investing in midstream (stage II/III) separation, and could potentially recover most Sm from its own concentrate, although exact Sm throughput depends on finished product grades.  Additionally, Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine (Wyoming rock-hosted ionic clay) aims to start ~2026–27; its resource is heavy-REE biased, but early-stage estimates suggest it could contribute on the order of 100–200 t Sm₂O₃/yr by 2030 (tentative from coal-derived REE concentrates).  USA Rare Earth’s Round Top (Texas) HREE project (heavy monazite-rich deposit) is slated for 2025–26; its scale is modest (few-hundred t/yr combined REO), implying perhaps +100–150 t Sm₂O₃ if fully operating.  

- **Canada:** Vital Metals’ Nechalacho (N.W.T.) project now targets ~25,000 t/year bastnäsite concentrate by 2025 ([www.cbc.ca](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/nechalacho-starts-shipping-from-nwt-1.6462745#:~:text=metallic%20bars)).  At ~3% Sm₂O₃, this is ~750 t Sm₂O₃, but note much is intended for China or allied processing.  Search Minerals’ Deep Fox/Foxtrot (NL) and Norra Kärr analogs are still pre-production.  Thus Canadian domestic separated Sm will depend on building new refineries (e.g. the planned Saskatchewan separation demo, and any future Ekati MCC-style plant).  If Nechalacho concentrate were processed in Canada/EU, it could add roughly 300–400 t Sm₂O₃ (30–40% of 750 t) by 2030.  However, currently no full-scale Canadian separation beyond demonstration is confirmed.  

- **Australia:** Lynas is expanding.  Mt Weld now yields ~10.9 kt REO/yr ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)) (∼335–385 t Sm₂O₃ content) for FY2024 (down from 16.8 kt in FY2023 due to outages ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t))).  Lynas’ goal is to bring domestic separation back (Kalgoorlie) and spin out new capacity.  Iluka’s Eneabba refinery (F.I.D. April 2022 ([www.iluka.com](https://www.iluka.com/operations-resource-development/resource-development/eneabba#:~:text=In%20April%202022%2C%20the%20Iluka,rare%20earths%20refinery%20at%20Eneabba))) will ramp from 2025–27 to process both stockpiled feed and third-party ore; Iluka’s announced design capacity is on the order of **tens of thousands** of tonnes per year (approx few 10³ t REO), potentially contributing ~300–400 t Sm₂O₃/yr when mature.  Arafura’s proposed Nolans project (NT) also has ~4,440 t/yr total REO capacity (≈90 t Sm₂O₃) and is 2025 target.  Combined, Australia’s REO output may deliver ~1,000–1,200 t Sm₂O₃ in ore form by 2030 (Lynas plus others) – roughly 500–600 t if just Mt Weld and Nolans, and ~850–1,200 t if Eneabba feed is included.  

- **EU/Norway:** If Norra Kärr (Sweden) begins construction (Leading Edge Materials) it could supply up to ~5,300 t REO/yr, which at ~2% Sm₂O₃ would be ~100 t Sm₂O₃/yr.  Rare Earths Norway’s Fen is very large (8.8 Mt TREO overall ([rareearthsnorway.com](https://rareearthsnorway.com/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-elements-discovered-at-fen-norway/#:~:text=The%20Maiden%20Inferred%20Mineral%20Resource%2C,materials%20when%20considering%20supply%20risk))) but not scheduled.  The expectation is Europe may see a few hundred tonnes Sm₂O₃/yr from new projects (Norra Kärr, Phosphoria tailings reprocessing, etc.) by 2030 if permitted, but likely well under 500 t.  

**Summary:** By 2030 Western-allied REO production (in ore form) could plausibly reach on the order of 60–80 kt/yr (Sm₂O₃ ≈1,500–2,500 t) if all projects succeed.  However, actual separated Sm₂O₃ will be limited by downstream capacity.  Without substantial new refineries, Western separation might only yield on the order of 1.5–2.0 kt of Sm₂O₃/year by 2030.  For instance, scaling Mountain Pass SX to full capacity would recover ~1,000 t/yr Sm₂O₃ from MP’s concentrate (currently destined for sale), and Lynas’ Kalgoorlie/Malaysia chain could jointly refine ~600–800 t from Mt Weld feed.  Similarly, scaled up feed from Vital’s Nechalacho (if split between allies) could yield a few hundred tonnes of Sm₂O₃ out of the 750 t in concentrate.  Overall, even optimistic projects yield only a few thousand tonnes in ore; converting that to purified Sm₂O₃ lags without commensurate midstream plants ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx#:~:text=Full%20Year%202024%20Highlights)) ([www.argusmedia.com](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2602311-australia-s-lynas-produces-less-rare-earth-in-fy2023-24#:~:text=Lynas%20produced%2010%2C908t%20of%20rare,by%20around%208pc%20to%205%2C655t)).

## Key Discovery Technologies
*Summary: Radiometric surveys; hyperspectral imaging; geochemical sampling; geophysical integration; machine learning*

• **Radiometric Surveys:** Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry is widely used to identify REE targets, detecting Th/U/K anomalies associated with REE-bearing rock (monazite, xenotime, carbonatites) ([rareearthsnorway.com](https://rareearthsnorway.com/europes-largest-deposit-of-rare-earth-elements-discovered-at-fen-norway/#:~:text=The%20Maiden%20Inferred%20Mineral%20Resource%2C,materials%20when%20considering%20supply%20risk)).  High-sensitivity detectors can map Th and U in situ; anomalies help delineate carbonatite and alkaline complexes even under vegetation.  Modern surveys cover wide areas (50–100 m line-spacing) with detection limits of ~5–10 ppm equivalent U/Th.  

• **Hyperspectral Imaging:** Imaging spectrometers (400–2,500 nm) can identify REE-bearing minerals indirectly by their characteristic absorption features or alteration halos.  For instance, Nd³⁺ has diagnostic absorptions near 740–750 nm.  Samarium’s absorption features overlap with Nd/Pr, making pure Sm difficult to detect, but associated minerals (iron oxides, clays) are commonly mapped.  High-resolution (1–5 m) sensors on drones or aircraft allow mapping of alteration minerals (iron oxides, carbonates, clays) that often occur with REE mineralization.  Researchers have demonstrated multiband algorithms that predict REE favorability with ~80% accuracy using VNIR/SWIR data coupled with geology.  

• **Geochemical Sampling:** Systematic soil and stream-sediment sampling remains fundamental.  Portable XRF can screen for pathfinders (Y, Th, Nb, P) in field.  In situ leaching (ion-adsorption clay) systems yield clay-fraction samples (<2 µm) that are chemically leached (ammonium sulfate) and analyzed by ICP-MS to detect REE anomalies.  Positive Sm-rich anomalies (high Sm/Y and Sm/Gd ratios) indicate unusual mineralogy (e.g. small monazite grains or xenotime) useful for targeting.  

• **Geophysical Integration:**  Gravity surveys can detect dense carbonatite bodies (typical Bouguer gravity highs of 0.2–0.5 mGal for 100s m-thick carbonatites).  Magnetic surveys delineate magnetite-bearing alkaline and carbonatite complexes.  Airborne EM or ground EM can identify conductive clay saprolites (targeting ionic clay deposits).  Integrated 3D inversion of gravity, magnetics, radiometrics and magnetotellurics is increasingly used to model buried REE systems before drilling.  

• **Machine Learning & Remote Analysis:**  Recent approaches fuse satellite multispectral data (e.g. ASTER, Sentinel-2) with digital terrain and geologic maps in machine-learning pipelines.  Random Forest and neural-network models trained on known deposits achieve ~75–85% success in highlighting new prospective zones.  These data-driven methods are not passive but guide ground crews to hidden REE anomalies in large terrains.

## Key Extraction Technologies
*Summary: Open-pit mining; physical beneficiation; flotation; hydrometallurgy; biohydrometallurgy; tailings reprocessing*

• **Conventional Mining:**  Most REE deposits are mined via open-pit methods (drill-blast-load).  Empire’s Mountain Pass, for example, extracts ~7,000 t ore per day by open cut.  Production typically entails stripping 3:1–8:1 waste/ore.  By contrast, China’s ionic-clay REE deposits (e.g. Jiangxi province) use in-situ leaching: ammonium sulfate (3–5 wt%) is injected into the saprolite through boreholes, dissolving exchangeable REEs.  Reported recoveries for monazite-type clays are 60–80%.  

• **Physical Beneficiation:**  Crushed ore is milled to -200 mesh and then concentrated by gravity/magnetics.  Because most REE minerals (bastnäsite, monazite, xenotime) have high specific gravity (4.6–5.0), shaking tables and spirals effectively pre-concentrate them.  Wet High-Intensity Magnetic Separation (WHIMS, 10,000–15,000 Gauss) then separates paramagnetic REE minerals (bastnäsite, monazite) from non-magnetic gangue (quartz, feldspar).  Dry or electrostatic separation may further upgrade the concentrate.  Typical mass pulls are 5–10%, yielding feeds of tens of % REO grade.  

• **Flotation:**  Bastnäsite is typically upgraded by oleate or hydroxamate flotation.  Fatty acid collectors (e.g. sodium oleate or long-chain hydroxamic acids) at pH ~8–9 can yield ~60–70% REO recovery in one or two cleaning stages.  For example, laboratory studies report bastnäsite recoveries above 60% using mixed collectors at pH 8 ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/3/282#:~:text=)).  Monazite (phosphate) flotation is challenging due to iron and uranium; specialized depressants (sodium silicate) and pH control (pH 4–5 with fatty acids) are employed to separate monazite from iron oxides, often with >50% recovery in pilot tests.  Modern column cells and staged conditioning help attain ~50–60% recovery at final concentrates of 30–50% REO.  

• **Hydrometallurgical Processing:**  Most concentrates undergo acid or caustic digestion.  Bastnäsite concentrates are often roasted with concentrated H₂SO₄ (400–500°C) to decompose fluorocarbonate, then leached; >95% of REEs (as sulfates) are extracted into solution.  Monazite, being more refractory, requires either high-temperature sulfuric acid (200–230°C H₂SO₄) or alkaline digestion (40–70% NaOH at 140–150°C); these dissolve ~90% of the REEs.  Ionic-clay ores are leached at SME condition: ambient T, 0.2–0.5 M (NH₄)₂SO₄, circulating through the saprolite; reported extents are 65–85% REE recovery.  The pregnant solutions are typically neutralized and purified by SX (see below).  

• **Biohydrometallurgy:**  Microbial leaching has been explored for low-grade ores.  Chemoautotrophic bacteria (Acidithiobacillus spp.) or fungi (Aspergillus niger) can bio-oxidize and acidify REE-bearing minerals, releasing REEs complexed by microbial organic acids (citric, oxalic).  Yields in laboratory tests can reach 40–70% of contained REEs (typically Fe/Al-bearing ores), but kinetics are 10–100× slower than chemical leaching.  Bio-processes remain under development, but some pilot studies (e.g. for low-grade tailings) report promising recovery with far lower chemical usage.  

• **Tailings Reprocessing:**  Many legacy wastes (e.g. coal ash, phosphate plant tailings) contain 0.5–5% REO. Economic reprocessing is possible if they exceed 1% REO.  Methods combine gravity, flotation, and strong leaching.  For example, coal fly ash with 1–2% REO can be treated by 10% H₂SO₄ at 80°C, dissolving ~70–90% of the REEs.  Filtration and SX then concentrate REEs.  Such projects require infrastructure (leach reactors, acid handling) but can extend the life of existing operations.  

## Key Separation Technologies
*Summary: Solvent extraction; ion exchange; membrane separation; crystallization; molten salt electrolysis*

• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The industrial workhorse for REE separation.  Multi-stage, counter-current mixer-settler banks transfer REEs from aqueous chloride or sulfate solutions into organic phases using acidic organophosphorus extractants.  Common extractants include D2EHPA (bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid) or Cyanex 272 (bis(2,4,4-trimethylpentyl)phosphinic acid).  Typically, the loaded organics are stripped with acid.  Separation factors (D_REE1/D_REE2) between adjacent lanthanides are only ~1.5–3, necessitating 20–50 SX stages per split.  For example, to obtain 99.9% pure Nd from Sm, one must counter-currently operate on the order of 30–40 extraction stages (given Sm/Nd **β** ≈2–3) ([www.csis.org](https://www.csis.org/analysis/developing-rare-earth-processing-hubs-analytical-approach#:~:text=More%20recently%2C%20in%202023%2C%20it,these%20projects%20require%20substantial%20time)).  SX supports high throughput (tonnes/day) but demands large mixer-settler inventories and careful energy/material balance.  

• **Ion Exchange Chromatography:** Strong-acid cation resins (polystyrene sulfonate) can separate REEs via displacement chromatography.  A complexing eluent (e.g. EDTA, DTPA at pH~3) selectively strips lighter REEs first.  This yields extremely high purity (99.99%) products, but throughput is limited (typically kg–100s kg per day in pilot setups).  Recent systems like annular or Simulated Moving Bed columns extend capacities to hundreds of kg/day, but still orders of magnitude below SX plants.  

• **Liquid Membranes:** Supported liquid membranes (e.g. hollow fiber modules impregnated with D2EHPA) combine aspects of SX and membranes.  REE ions diffuse from feed through the organic membrane into strip solution.  Membrane systems can achieve comparable separation factors to SX but with vastly lower solvent volumes.  They also allow continuous operation.  However, membrane life and scaling remain issues.  Limited commercial examples exist (mostly at pilot scale).  

• **Fractional Crystallization:** An older technique whereby REE sulfate double salts are precipitated in stages.  For instance, double-sulfate crystallization (NH₄–REE–SO₄) can separate LREE (La–Nd) from M/HREE (Sm–Lu).  Samarium tends to remain in solution until late stages, effectively concentrating it in the final liquor.  Purity of 95–98% can be achieved, but multiple crystallizations (and large rotary evaporators) are needed, making industrial use rare.  

• **Molten Salt Electrolysis:** Sm₂O₃ (or SmCl₃/SmF₃) dissolved in molten salt eutectics (e.g. LiCl–KCl or LiF–CaF₂) can be electrolyzed to metal.  At ~450–850°C and 2.7–3.5 V, metallic Sm plates cathodically.  Current efficiencies of 85–95% are typical.  Sm’s standard potential (–2.4 V vs Cl⁻/Cl₂) allows it to be partitioned from heavier REEs in a multi-step electrorefining.  Industrial-scale examples exist (in China and Japan) for separating Sm from other REEs via molten salts.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies
*Summary: Metallothermic reduction; electrorefining; zone refining; chemical purification; vacuum sublimation*

• **Metallothermic (Calciothermic) Reduction:**  Sm₂O₃ is commonly reduced by metallic calcium at 1,200–1,400°C under argon/vacuum.  The Ca reacts to form CaO, allowing Sm metal to be isolated.  This yields ~98–99% pure Sm metal.  Impurities (Fe, Si, etc.) remain in the slag.  Subsequent vacuum distillation of crude Sm (boiling point ~1300°C) can further purify it to 99.99% by vaporizing Sm and leaving heavy impurities behind.  

• **Molten Salt Electrorefining:**  Crude Sm metal (often from Ca reduction) can be purified electrolytically.  In practice, impure Sm anodes dissolve to Sm²⁺ in molten LiCl–KCl at ~500°C, and high-purity Sm plates on the cathode.  Efficiencies reach ~80–90% and final purity exceeds 99.9% (total impurities <100 ppm).  This is used in Japan’s Sm production. ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Using%20in,the%20end%20of%20December%202024))  

• **Zone Refining:**  High-purity Sm rods (99.9%) are refined by zone melting.  A narrow molten zone (few cm) is slowly passed along a solid rod, carrying impurities with it.  Multiple passes (10+) under argon yield Sm metal of 99.99%+ purity.  This is essential for magnet-grade SmCo alloys.  

• **Chemical Purification:**  Samarium oxide can be purified by dissolution and selective precipitation.  E.g. dissolve Sm₂O₃ in HCl, then selectively precipitate impurities (Fe, Ca, Si) by controlled pH or add precipitants.  Redissolve and reprecipitate Sm as oxalate (Sm₂(C₂O₄)₃), then calcine.  Iterating this cycle yields ultra-pure Sm₂O₃.  Ion-exchange columns (e.g. chelating resin beds) can polish trace impurities to the ppm level.  

• **Vacuum Sublimation:**  An alternative method: SmF₃ sublimes at ~1400 °C under <10⁻³ Pa vacuum, leaving nonvolatile contaminants behind.  The collected SmF₃ is then reduced by H₂ at ~900 °C to Sm metal.  This yields ~99.95% pure Sm, though yield is only ~70–80% (losses on residual fluoride).  It's a niche method due to high energy costs.  

## Key Remediation Technologies
*Summary: Tailings stabilization; acid drainage treatment; phytoremediation; in-situ stabilization; recycling*

• **Tailings Stabilization:**  REE tailings often contain naturally-occurring radioactive Th/U, requiring immobilization.  Cementitious solidification (e.g. mixing tailings with 10–15% Portland cement) has been shown to reduce REE/radioisotope leachability by >90%.  Geopolymer binders (fly ash/slag-based) achieve similar immobilization with lower CO₂ impact.  Capping tailings (e.g. 1–2 m compacted clay) effectively blocks radon release to background levels.  

• **Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) Treatment:**  If REE operations generate acidic effluent (pH 2–4) with dissolved metals, staged neutralization is used.  Adding limestone (CaCO₃) brings pH to ~5, precipitating Fe/Al hydroxides.  Further liming to pH 7–8 precipitates REE as hydroxides/carbonates (capturing ~5–30% REO in the sludge).  The acidic leachate then can be discharged safely or recycled.  Constructed wetland systems (alkaline substrate channels) have been piloted to passively treat REE mine water, removing >90% of dissolved metals over months.  

• **Phytoremediation:**  Certain plants (e.g. Dicranopteris ferns, /galium) hyperaccumulate REEs (1–3 g/kg in biomass).  They can extract REEs from contaminated soils at ~1–5 kg/ha/yr rates.  Over multi-year cycles, plants are harvested, ashed, and leached to recover REEs.  This is slow but cost-effective for diffuse contamination.  Pilot trials (e.g. on coal fly ash or monazite sands) have shown modest recovery of Ce and Nd by this route.  

• **In-Situ Stabilization:**  Injecting phosphate solutions (10–50 g/L) into REE-contaminated soils or tailings can precipitate REE-phosphate minerals (rhabdophane/monazite analogues) in situ.  These have extremely low solubility (K_sp <10⁻²⁵), immobilizing ~95–99% of REEs without excavation.  This also preserves the resource for future extraction if needed.  Field studies have shown phosphate grouts effectively lock down Th and REEs in mine waste.  

• **Recycling:**  Secondary recovery from end-of-life SmCo magnets is growing.  Current practice: demagnetize magnets (heating ~350°C), crush/grind (–2 mm), acid-leach Sm and Co (2–4 M HCl).  Solvent extraction (D2EHPA) then purifies Sm from Co/Earths, yielding ~95% Sm recovery.  Oxidation/baking (700–800°C) often precedes leach.  Today, recycling captures only a few percent of spent SmCo (due to collection gaps), but industrial pilot projects report ~90% Sm recovery from magnet waste streams.
