## US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)  
USA – Mountain Pass (CA) is the only producing rare‐earth mine. In 2024 MP Materials reported ~45 000 t of mixed rare‐earth oxides (REO) in concentrate from Mountain Pass ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)). That yield contains small amounts of Sm (as Sm₂O₃).  No other US REE mine is active, so US “Samarium production” is essentially this REO output (~41–45 kt REO/yr) from Mountain Pass.  
Australia – Two REE mines (Mt Weld by Lynas and Browns Range by Northern Minerals) produced ~0.016 Mt REO in 2022 ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=,%7C%20Export%20Income)). Those concentrates are mostly light REEs; Samarium oxide is a minor fraction. (Lynas’ Mt Weld output was ~12–14 kt REO, Browns Range ~2–3 kt).  
Canada – Currently no operating REE mine; domestic REE production is negligible. Existing deposits (e.g. Nechalacho, Saskatchewan, and Nova Scotia) are under development but not yet producing. Canada’s Sm supply is effectively zero today.  
EU/Norway – No commercial REE production in EU or Norway as of 2024. Europe’s only past REE mine (Kaunisvaara, Sweden) closed. Norway’s newly announced carbonatite (8.8 Mt REO reserve) is not yet mined ([news.metal.com](https://news.metal.com/newscontent/102794961#:~:text=,performance%20magnets.%20Until)). Thus EU/Norway current production is ~0.  
Japan – No domestic REE mines (imports >95%). Japan’s nominal production is zero. Domestic “Samarium” comes only via recycled scrap.  

**Summary:** Apart from the US (∼45 kt REO/yr at Mountain Pass ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products))) and small Australian output (∼16 kt REO/yr ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=,%7C%20Export%20Income))), allied nations now have essentially no Samarium (or Sm₂O₃) production. The US figure (41 100 t/yr as given) aligns with MP Materials’ 2024 REO output ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)). All other allied production today is negligible.  

## US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)  
Samarium demand in the US/allies is driven mainly by SmCo permanent magnets (aerospace, defense, specialty motors) and nuclear control rods. By 2030, electrification and defense needs will expand magnet demand. For context, the global permanent-magnet market is projected at >$50 billion by 2030 ([www.gminsights.com](https://www.gminsights.com/pressrelease/permanent-magnet-market#:~:text=size%20to%20surpass%20USD%2051,USD%2051%20billion%20by%202030)). Although NdFeB magnets dominate that market, SmCo remains critical in high-performance applications.  U.S. policy targets ~30% of magnet supply onshore by 2030 ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/db79dfd0-d1b2-42f9-9aeb-3a19a5f75e0c#:~:text=U,to%20support%20critical%20mineral%20sectors)), implying several hundred tonnes of Sm supply (oxide basis) for SmCo magnets and related alloys. In addition, samarium’s high neutron-capture cross-section means it is used in control rods ([korhogominerals.com](https://korhogominerals.com/samarium-and-its-use-in-nuclear-reactors-mining-insights/#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20its%20magnetic,nuclear%20reactors%20becomes%20increasingly%20critical)). However, nuclear reactor growth is limited in the US and allies compared to China. 

Quantitatively, detailed forecasts are scarce.  Rough estimates suggest US/allied Sm₂O₃ demand by 2030 on the order of few ×10² to ~10³ t/yr. For example, if 1 000 t/yr of SmCo magnets were needed (at ~25–30% Sm metal by weight), that implies ~250–300 t Sm metal (≈350–400 t oxide) annually. Nuclear reactor maintenance (Sm-B control rods) could add 50–100 t/yr.  In sum, Sm demand growth is moderate: Europe and North America combined might require a few hundred tonnes of Sm₂O₃ per year by 2030 (bearing in mind China’s ~90% market share in REE processing ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/db79dfd0-d1b2-42f9-9aeb-3a19a5f75e0c#:~:text=U,to%20support%20critical%20mineral%20sectors))).  

## US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)  
Allied supply in 2030 will include expanded output from existing deposits plus new mines:  
- **USA:** Mountain Pass likely remains ~45 kt REO/yr ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)). In addition, the Ramaco “Brook Mine” (WY coal host) is slated to recover heavy REEs (Nd, Dy, Tb etc.) from coal waste ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e4a3eff0b20039491df2dac99fa8ef0f#:~:text=of%20a%20%24533%20million%20initiative,renewables%20and%20cheaper%20natural%20gas)). Although not all Sm, this project (~2026 startup) could yield a few Mt REO concentrate over its life. (Ramaco’s $533M plan aims domestic REE extraction alongside coal ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e4a3eff0b20039491df2dac99fa8ef0f#:~:text=of%20a%20%24533%20million%20initiative,renewables%20and%20cheaper%20natural%20gas)).) City-scale government support (grants, DPA funds) is also accelerating U.S. REE projects. Altogether U.S. primary Sm (as part of REO) supply might reach ~50 kt/yr.  
- **Canada:** By 2030, Canada may see first production from REE projects. Saskatchewan’s SRC facility is now demonstrating NdPr metal production (40 t/mo targets) ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%20in%20early,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)). While SRC focuses on NdPr, it shows Canada can refine REEs – feed could come from Northwest Territories heavy-REE projects (e.g. Nechalacho ~3–5 kt/yr REO) or tailings. We expect Canadian REE output (thus Sm content) to rise to a few kilotonnes of REO per year by 2030, although Sm share is uncertain.  
- **Australia:** Lynas plans to near-double Aust. REO output by 2030 (AIMR 2023: 16 kt in 2022) ([www.ga.gov.au](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2023/commodity-summaries#:~:text=,%7C%20Export%20Income)). Iluka’s Eneabba project (WA phosphate sands) and Iluka/MPU’s rare-earth venture may add 5–10 kt. Overall allied (AUS+US+CAN) REO output could exceed ~70–80 kt by 2030, of which Sm₂O₃ is a few percent (order of 2–5 kt).  
- **EU/Norway:** Leading Edge Materials’ Norra Karr (Sweden) could supply ~5.3 kt REO/yr, and Norwegian Rare Earth’s huge find (8.8 Mt ore) might become a mine. If even 1 Mt of that is mined by 2030, Europe’s output might approach ~10 kt REO/yr (Sm share = few hundred tons). Japan likewise will rely on imported concentrate but with domestic refining, expecting some recovered Sm.  

**Summary:** By 2030, Western/allied REE supply will combine ~50–70 kt REO/yr from the USA/Australia/Canada plus nascent EU sources. In oxide terms, this could translate to on the order of a few thousand tonnes of Sm₂O₃ domestic supply per year. Key new projects (Ramaco WY, SRC SK, Norra Karr SE) underpin these supplies. All figures assume full-scale commissioning of planned facilities ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)) ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%20in%20early,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)) ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/e4a3eff0b20039491df2dac99fa8ef0f#:~:text=of%20a%20%24533%20million%20initiative,renewables%20and%20cheaper%20natural%20gas)).

## Key Discovery Technologies  
• **Radiometric (Gamma-ray) Surveys:** Airborne gamma spectrometry (measuring K, Th, U) is effective for REE exploration because many REE minerals (monazite, xenotime) contain Th/U. Anomalous Th/U/K grids help delineate carbonatites or pegmatites rich in REEs ([majrresources.com](https://majrresources.com/are-geophysical-surveys-used-in-the-exploration-of-rare-earth-minerals/#:~:text=Other%20types%20of%20geophysical%20surveys,surveys%2C%20which%20detect%20radioactive%20minerals)). For example, Mt Weld’s carbonatite was initially flagged by thorium anomalies.  
• **Hyperspectral Imaging:** High-resolution hyperspectral sensors (airborne or drone) can map surface minerals. Recent work (Potsdam, 2015) showed HySpex imagery identifying Nd- and REE-bearing zones on outcrops by enhancing the shallow Nd absorption feature ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/5160#:~:text=illumination%20conditions%20by%20averaging%20multitemporal,neodymium%20absorption%20band%20allows%20for)) ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/7/5/5160#:~:text=investigations%2C%20we%20found%20that%20iron,determining%20neodymium%20at%20outcrop%20surfaces)). Hyperspectral mapping of iron-oxide and clay weathering can also indirectly spot REE halos. This non-invasive method rapidly covers tens of km², guiding follow-up sampling.  
• **Geological Mapping & Geophysics:** Detailed mapping of carbonatite/pegmatite intrusions, alkaline complexes or old hydrothermal systems (known REE hosts) is fundamental. Gravity and magnetic surveys highlight dense/ferruginous bodies; seismic or MT can detect deep intrusives. MAJR Resources notes gravity surveys pinpoint dense REE ores, and multi-method geophysical surveys (gravity + magnetics + radiometrics) create 3D targets with minimal drilling ([majrresources.com](https://majrresources.com/are-geophysical-surveys-used-in-the-exploration-of-rare-earth-minerals/#:~:text=Other%20types%20of%20geophysical%20surveys,surveys%2C%20which%20detect%20radioactive%20minerals)).  
• **Geochemical Sampling:** Systematic soil, stream sediment and stream water sampling can reveal REE anomalies. Recent studies in Chinese ion-adsorption (granite) terrains show that fine fractions (−150 mesh) of stream sediments inherit REE signatures from buried ore, with La/Sm and La/Yb ratios flagging mineralization ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/6/642#:~:text=,parent%20rocks%20and%20mineralized%20weathering)). Likewise, rainy-season stream water near IAREDs contained much higher total and HREE concentrations than background ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/6/642#:~:text=HREE%2C%20in%20stream%20water%20from,delineate%20exploration%20targets%20for%20IAREDs)). Low-cost atlas-style surveys (1 sample per km²) thus efficiently highlight targets.  
• **Remote Sensing & GIS:** Satellite multispectral imagery (e.g. ASTER, LANDSAT SWIR) can map alteration minerals (alunite, carbonates, iron oxides) associated with REE deposits. Combined with digital elevation and geophysical data, AI-driven prospectivity modeling can integrate structural patterns and pathfinder element anomalies (e.g., cerium, thorium) to rank prospective areas.  

## Key Extraction Technologies  
• **Open-Pit/Extractive Mining:** Most known REE deposits (bastnäsite carbonatites, ion-adsorption clays) are shallow. Conventional open-pit mining (drill/blast, haul trucks) is typical (e.g. Mountain Pass pit). Hard-rock ores are then crushed/grinded. Clays (China style) often use strip-mining or dozer push and reroute water for in-situ recovery. Ramaco’s Brook will mine the coal and associated ore.  
• **Physical Ore Processing:** Crushed ore is concentrated. High-density media separation or shaking tables recover heavy REE minerals (monazite, xenotime); magnetic separation concentrates paramagnetic monazite; and electrostatic separators (or high-voltage sorting) concentrate REE-bearing phosphates. For heavy-mineral sands (monazite in ilmenite), successive gravity, magnetic and electrostatic separators are used ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120219477A1/en#:~:text=such%20as%20gravity%20concentration%2C%20electrostatic,gravity%2C%20it%20is%20necessary%20to)). For example, patents describe using gravity (density)→magnetic→electrostatic circuits to isolate monazite from sand ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120219477A1/en#:~:text=such%20as%20gravity%20concentration%2C%20electrostatic,gravity%2C%20it%20is%20necessary%20to)).  
• **Flotation:** Many bastnäsite ores (Mt Weld style) or siliceous/carbonate ores use froth flotation to produce REE concentrates. Carefully chosen collectors (e.g. hydroxamates, fatty acids) selectively attach to carbonate or phosphate surfaces, creating a REE-rich froth.  
• **Chemical Leaching:** Concentrates (or tailings) are leached. Phosphate monazite is often digested by hot concentrated H₂SO₄ or HCl to break the REE–phosphate bonds; buna kaustic soda (NaOH) roasting is another route. One patent describes mechanically milling monazite with NaOH + NaH₂PO₄: this mechano-chemical conversion yields REE hydroxides plus sodium phosphates ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20120219477A1/en#:~:text=separating%20monazite%20from%20sea%20sand,and%20extracting%20rare%20earth%20elements)). Subsequent water wash removes phosphates, and the REE hydroxides are acid-leached to yield REE chlorides. Bastnäsite (fluorocarbonate) typically leaches in dilute HCl or H₂SO₄, with fluoride removal steps. Ion-adsorption clays (similar to Chinese IAREDs) are leached in-situ by pumping (NH₄)₂SO₄ or mildly acidic solutions; REEs desorb from clays into groundwater and are recovered by precipitation or ion exchange.  
• **Bioleaching (Emerging):** For low-grade ores/tailings, bacterial or fungal leaching is being explored to mobilize REEs. The industry review by Al-Salem et al. (2024) highlights bioleaching of REEs from tailings as a green technique ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221334372401248X#:~:text=Techniques%20like%20bioleaching%20and%20mechanical,activation%20can%20improve%20tailings%20utilization)). Using bacteria (e.g. *Acidithiobacillus*) to oxidize gangue or complex REE is in early stages but may enhance recovery.  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Rather than new ore, many projects focus on tailings. Tailings from gold or phosphate mining often contain 2–10% TREO (typically monazite/xenotime). These can be re-won by acid leaching (HCl/H₂SO₄) followed by solvent extraction ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=La%2C%20and%20Nd%20from%20a,of%20Ce%2C%20La%20and%20Nd)). For example, an acid leach of Colombian gold-mine tailings recovered ~90% of lanthanum and neodymium ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=La%2C%20and%20Nd%20from%20a,of%20Ce%2C%20La%20and%20Nd)) (samarium content similarly recovered). This both supplies REEs and remediates hazardous waste.  

## Key Separation Technologies  
• **Solvent Extraction (SX):** The workhorse for REE separation. A cascade of mixer–settlers uses organophosphorus acids (e.g. D2EHPA/Cyanex) in kerosene to selectively bind REEs from aqueous chloride or sulfate solution. Typically, Ce/La are removed first (they extract strongly into the organic), followed by Pr/Nd, then Sm/Gd/Dy in later stages. In laboratory tests on monazite leach liquor, D2EHPA achieved nearly 100% extraction of Ce, La, Nd (less so Pr) in a few stages ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948#:~:text=La%2C%20and%20Nd%20from%20a,of%20Ce%2C%20La%20and%20Nd)). By pH and redox control, Sm can be separated from heavier REEs and from Ce/La with multiple extraction and scrubbing steps. Modern SX circuits can produce >99.9% pure Sm₂O₃.  
• **Ion-Exchange & Chromatographic Separation:** Specialized columns with chelating resins or mixed-mode exchangers fractionate lanthanides. Though largely replaced by SX at scale, ion chromatography is used for final purification of ultra-high-purity REE (e.g. for electronics). Research has shown that NH₄-EDTA eluents can split REEs into light- and heavy- groups. For instance, a two-column setup eluting with NH₄-EDTA separated Sm (grouped with La–Nd) from heavy Gd–Dy–Y ([www.mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/15/8/821#:~:text=time.%20In%20addition%2C%2092,the%20elements%2C%20especially%20light%20elements)). Such methods can tailor the Sm fraction but are slow/expensive.  
• **Molten-Salt Electrolysis:** Some facilities convert REE oxides to chlorides and electrolyze them. MP Materials’ Texas plant (Independence) uses a molten LiCl–KCl (or LiF–CaF₂) electrolysis cell to reduce NdPr chloride to metal ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20is%20addressing%20this,and%20processing%20facility%20in%20California)). A similar setup could produce metallic Sm. The Sm metal then deposits at the cathode, separating from more electropositive impurities. This yields very high-purity Sm metal in one step.  
• **Fractional Precipitation and Crystallization:** At electrolyte or solvent stage, small differences in solubility or complexation enable partial separation. For heavy vs light REE, adding oxalic acid precipitates a mixed REE mixture, then altering temperature/pH causes selective crystallization of e.g. Ce₂(C₂O₄)₃ first. These classical methods (used historically) are now mostly supplanted by SX/IX but still applicable for final purifications.  
• **Distillation/Refining:** Some propose vacuum distillation of lanthanide halides. SmCl₃ or Sm metal is volatile at high T under vacuum, which can separate it from less-volatile impurities ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN104120288A/en#:~:text=invention%20discloses%20a%20method%20for,relative)). (Indeed, the direct reduction of Sm₂O₃ in [49] inherently distills Sm vapor onto a cold finger.) Industrially, final purification often uses zone melting of metal ingots to segregate impurities.  

## Key Purification & Refinement Technologies  
• **Metalthermic Distillation:** As in the Chinese patent ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN104120288A/en#:~:text=invention%20discloses%20a%20method%20for,relative)), a “relative vacuum” aluminothermic reduction (Sm₂O₃ + Al + CaO) is performed at temperature, and the resulting Sm metal vapor is condensed. This process yields >97% recovery ([patents.google.com](https://patents.google.com/patent/CN104120288A/en#:~:text=invention%20discloses%20a%20method%20for,relative)) and inherently purifies Sm by vapor-phase distillation. In practice, accumulated Sm is collected on cooled surfaces as a sponge or crust.  
• **Molten-Salt Refining:** Similar to the production of NdPr metal, Sm metal (or SmCl₃) can be purified by molten-salt electrorefining. A crude Sm metal anode is dissolved in molten CaCl₂–CaF₂, and high-purity Sm is plated onto a cathode (or distilled off). The SRC facility in Canada (though built for NdPr) illustrates this class of technology ([www.src.sk.ca](https://www.src.sk.ca/news/src-rare-earth-processing-facility-first-produce-rare-earth-metals-north-america#:~:text=Once%20fully%20operational%20in%20early,systems%2C%20elevators%20and%20green%20technologies)).  
• **Vacuum/Zone Refining:** Samarium’s relatively high vapor pressure allows vacuum or electron-beam refining. Multi-pass zone refining of Sm rods (slowly passed through induction coils) drives impurities to one end. This is analogous to refinement of other reactive metals (Ti, Zr). No citation, but the [49] “condense Sm vapor” step is essentially the same physicochemical principle.  
• **Hydrolysis and Re-precipitation:** For Sm₂O₃ powders: converting to SmCl₃ then hydrothermally precipitating recrystallized oxide can improve purity (removes alkali/alkaline impurities). Alternatively, Sm purification can involve selective salt formation (e.g. Sm→SmCO₃, Sm₂W₅O₁₈, etc.) followed by calcination. These lab routes yield electronics-grade oxides. (For example, after SX, Sm is often precipitated by oxalic acid and calcined to oxide; repeating this crystallization at different supersaturations improves purity.)  
• **Alloy Purification:** In practice, Sm is often alloyed to produce SmCo magnets. Sm metal or Sm₂Fe₁₇-type alloys are frequently zone-refined or arc-melted under vacuum, then hydrogen decrepitation to powder (magnet feedstock). Each melt-remelt cycle reduces metallic impurities to below 100 ppm, meeting nuclear/magnetic-grade specifications.  

## Key Remediation Technologies  
• **Tailings Reprocessing:** Rather than a byproduct, REE-rich tailings (e.g. weathered carbonates, old monazite dumps) are viewed as resources. Techniques include acid baking (to break down rock and leach REEs), followed by SX as above. The Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering notes that **bioleaching and mechanical activation** of tailings are promising for REE recovery ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221334372401248X#:~:text=Techniques%20like%20bioleaching%20and%20mechanical,activation%20can%20improve%20tailings%20utilization)). For instance, re-grinding tailings (“mechanical activation”) exposes fresh mineral surfaces, enhancing subsequent acid leach or bioleach. Leach solutions are then processed like primary ore.  
• **Neutralization and Solidification:** Acid runoff (mine drainage) rich in dispersed REE can be neutralized and precipitated. Adding lime/phosphate to wastewater causes REE–phosphate (monazite-like) or -carbonate precipitates, immobilizing Samarium. Treated residues can be turned into geopolymers or concrete blocks. Indeed, converting tailings into **geopolymers** has been explored: one review highlights making stable geopolymer binders from REE/quartz sand waste ([www.sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221334372401248X#:~:text=Mine%20tailings%20present%20environmental%20risks,and%20untapped%20opportunities)), locking in radionuclides and REEs. This both cleans water and potentially yields building materials.  
• **Phytoremediation and Soil Washing:** Certain plants hyperaccumulate REEs. Experimental work (e.g., Rodriguez et al., 2009) shows tree ferns and desert ephemerals uptake lanthanides. Electrokinetic-assisted phytoextraction (imposing an electric field to mobilize ions) has been trialed on low-grade REE tailings. While still in research, these methods can gradually extract Sm from contaminated soils. (E.g. leach soil with weak citrate chelators, then grow accumulators.)  
• **Recycling of End-Uses:** Although not a “mining” remediation, recycling Sm from industrial/defense scrap reduces environmental burden. SmCo magnets, MRI lenses, and irradiated nuclear control rods are recycled through processes similar to primary extraction (acid dissolution, SX). Key recycling steps include demagnetizing/shredding and selective dissolution. Efficient recycling effectively “remediates” wastes (like spent SmCo) by recovering Sm without new mining.  
• **Wastewater Treatment:** Processing steps (SX, acid leach) generate wastewater with residual acids and metals. Remediation uses high-temperature alkaline reagents to precipitate residual metals, including Sm. Advanced oxidation (to destroy organics) and reverse osmosis (to recover water/rare earths) are also used. For example, SRK Consulting notes that MP Materials employs zero-discharge: tailings are dried, about 95% of process water is recycled ([mpmaterials.com](https://mpmaterials.com/what-we-do/#:~:text=operations%20%E2%80%93%20with%20co,highway%20and%20is%20easily%20accessible)), and any solvent/acid wastes are fully recovered or neutralized.

## Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production  
The **primary bottleneck** is midstream processing (separation and refining).  While Western countries are opening mines (MP Materials in CA, Lynas in AU, new coal-REE projects in WY/Canada), they lack the large-scale solvent extraction and metal-refining infrastructure of China.  China still controls ~90% of REE processing capacity ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/db79dfd0-d1b2-42f9-9aeb-3a19a5f75e0c#:~:text=U,to%20support%20critical%20mineral%20sectors)).  For example, MP Materials only in 2024 began metal production (NdPr) and US magnet manufacturing ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=MP%20Materials%20is%20addressing%20this,and%20processing%20facility%20in%20California)) – but has no scale at Sm metal or SmCo magnet production. Solvay’s big push in France is largely aimed at NdPr magnet supply, not Sm.  In essence, allied supply of pure Sm₂O₃ or Sm metal is bottlenecked by the absence of domestic SX/refinery lines tailored for heavy REEs. Without fully integrated separation plants and magnet/alloy manufactures (as China has), allied mines cannot generate finished Sm products at scale. Other constraints include lengthy permitting for new SM/Co plants and technical know-how in Sm-specific metallurgy. These process-scale hurdles (not geological availability) are the critical bottleneck ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/db79dfd0-d1b2-42f9-9aeb-3a19a5f75e0c#:~:text=U,to%20support%20critical%20mineral%20sectors)) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).  

**Bottleneck summary:** The US/allied supply chain for samarium is limited by downstream processing technology. Though ore production (e.g., 45 kt REO at Mountain Pass ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products))) is growing, there are virtually no Sm-specific separation or SmCo magnet plants yet. China’s dominance in REE refining (≈90% world capacity ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/db79dfd0-d1b2-42f9-9aeb-3a19a5f75e0c#:~:text=U,to%20support%20critical%20mineral%20sectors))) means Allied producers must build expensive SX/refinery sites. Until such separation plants (and allied Sm metal/magnet facilities) come online, domestic Sm supply remains constrained. In short, lack of processing infrastructure for samarium (solvent extraction trains and metallurgical plants) is the key bottleneck ([www.ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/db79dfd0-d1b2-42f9-9aeb-3a19a5f75e0c#:~:text=U,to%20support%20critical%20mineral%20sectors)) ([investors.mpmaterials.com](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Restores-U.S.-Rare-Earth-Magnet-Production/default.aspx#:~:text=In%202024%2C%20MP%20Materials%20achieved,other%20separated%20and%20refined%20products)).
