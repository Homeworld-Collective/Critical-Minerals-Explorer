## **1\) US & allies ‚Äî current production (mined REO and what that implies for Sm)**

**United States (Mountain Pass, CA)**

* ‚úÖ *There is one operating rare‚Äëearth mine in the U.S.*

* üîé **Numbers:** In **2024**, U.S. mine output was **\~45,000 t REO (in mineral concentrates)**, per USGS. MP Materials separately reports a **record 45,455 t REO** and **1,294 t NdPr oxide** produced in 2024; it also **began commercial NdPr metal** and **trial magnet** production late 2024\. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)[MP Materials](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx)

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important nuance:** Saying U.S. ‚Äúsamarium production is essentially this REO output‚Äù is **incorrect**. Mountain Pass is **Ce/La/Nd/Pr‚Äëdominant bastn√§site**; Sm occurs only as a **minor fraction** of TREO and is **not** produced as a separated Sm oxide/metal at scale today in the U.S. (MP‚Äôs initial separation focus is NdPr). Treating the whole REO tonnage as ‚Äúsamarium‚Äù overstates U.S. Sm supply by **\~two orders of magnitude**. [MP Materials](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx)[U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)

**Australia**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Your figure ‚Äú\~0.016 Mt REO in 2022‚Äù (16 kt) is *not representative of Australia‚Äôs current mine output*. According to USGS, **Australia mined \~113,000 t REO in 2024** (and \~116,000 t in 2023\) ‚Äî an order of magnitude higher ‚Äî dominated by Lynas‚Äô Mt Weld. Browns Range remains **pilot-scale** (hundreds of tonnes of RE carbonate in some years), not 2‚Äì3 kt/year. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)

**Canada**

* ‚úÖ *No sustained commercial REE mine production at present.* USGS lists **no Canadian mine output** in 2023‚Äì2024. (Vital Metals‚Äô small Nechalacho effort was curtailed; Canada‚Äôs main activity today is **processing R\&D** such as the **Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) Rare Earth Processing Facility**.) [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)[Annual Reports](https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/n/ASX_NTU_2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**EU/Norway**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è *Corrections:*

  * **Kaunisvaara** is **an iron‚Äëore mine** in Sweden (operating since 2018 under Kaunis Iron). It is **not** a past REE mine. [Kaunis Iron](https://www.kaunisiron.se/en/our-operations/mines/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Mining:** As of 2024‚Äì2025, **no EU or Norwegian REE mines** are in commercial production. However, **Rare Earths Norway (Fen carbonatite)** has announced a JORC‚Äëcompliant **inferred resource \~559 Mt @ 1.57% TREO (\~8.8 Mt TREO)** ‚Äî a *resource*, not a producing mine. Any mining is **years away**. [MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/rare-earths-norway-says-its-ree-discovery-is-europes-largest/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Processing exists in Europe:** **Solvay (France)** supplies **\~4,000 t/yr** separated RE oxides; **REEtec (Norway)** targets **\~720 t/yr NdPr** starting 2025\. That‚Äôs processing, not mining. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[TechMet Ltd](https://www.techmet.com/assets/reetec/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Japan**

* ‚úÖ *No domestic REE mines; reliant on imports.* (Japan focuses on mid‚Äë/downstream tech and recycling.) [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/data/chemistry-data-rare-earth-carbonate-minerals-mountain-pass-rare-earth-element-deposit?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Bottom line (current):**  
 The U.S. mines \~45 kt REO (mostly LREE, Sm is minor); Australia is the allied mining heavyweight at \~113 kt REO; Canada/EU/Norway/Japan have **no mining** at scale yet. Don‚Äôt equate REO tonnage with ‚ÄúSm production.‚Äù [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)

## **2\) US & allies ‚Äî 2030 demand for Sm (order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude check)**

* **Where Sm is used:** chiefly **SmCo permanent magnets** (high‚Äëtemperature/defense/aerospace, specialty motors) and **burnable poisons in reactors** (Sm‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ has been used, e.g., in Belgium‚Äôs BR2 program). [researchportal.sckcen.be](https://researchportal.sckcen.be/files/270154/CR_report.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Market size clues:** A reputable industry report puts **North America‚Äôs SmCo magnet demand at \~475 t in 2024**, trending to \~575 t by 2033\. [IMARC Group](https://www.imarcgroup.com/north-america-samarium-cobalt-magnets-market?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Converting magnets ‚Üí Sm metal:**

  * **SmCo‚ÇÖ** magnets are **\~36 wt% Sm**. [Stanford Magnets](https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/smco-magnets-composition-series-and-types.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Sm‚ÇÇCo‚ÇÅ‚Çá** magnets are generally **\~25 wt% Sm** (typical). [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarium%E2%80%93cobalt_magnet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * So **475 t of SmCo magnets ‚âà 120‚Äì170 t of Sm metal** (25‚Äì36% range) for **North America alone** in 2024\. Extrapolating to the **U.S.+EU+Japan** suggests **‚Äúa few hundred tonnes of Sm metal per year‚Äù** for allied markets by 2030 is **plausible** ‚Äî but still **small compared with NdFeB** markets. (Nuclear Sm demand exists but is modest relative to magnets.) [IMARC Group](https://www.imarcgroup.com/north-america-samarium-cobalt-magnets-market?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Stanford Magnets](https://www.stanfordmagnets.com/smco-magnets-composition-series-and-types.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarium%E2%80%93cobalt_magnet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Policy targets:** The EU‚Äôs **CRMA** aims by **2030** to **process 40%** and **recycle 25%** of strategic raw materials domestically (and **mine 10%**), but there is **no specific ‚Äú30% magnet‚Äù onshoring target in U.S. law** that I can source. Your ‚ÄúU.S. 30% magnet supply onshore by 2030‚Äù line should be **removed or re‚Äësourced**. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Takeaway:** Your magnitude (‚Äúfew √ó10¬≤ to \~10¬≥ t Sm‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/yr by 2030 for allies‚Äù) is **reasonable** as a **broad range**, but please frame it as a **range with caveats** and cite actual market tonnage where available (e.g., NA \~475 t SmCo in 2024).

## **3\) US & allies ‚Äî 2030 supply outlook (what‚Äôs realistic)**

* **U.S.:** Mountain Pass likely remains the backbone (order‚Äëof‚Äë**\~45 kt REO/yr** based on recent actuals). MP is now producing **NdPr oxide** and **NdPr metal** and piloting magnet output in Texas, but there is **no announced Sm separation line**. Treating the full 45 kt REO as ‚Äúfuture Sm supply‚Äù would be **incorrect**; **Sm is a small minor** in its LREE concentrate. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)[MP Materials](https://investors.mpmaterials.com/investor-news/news-details/2025/MP-Materials-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx)

  * **Ramaco ‚ÄúBrook Mine‚Äù (WY):** AP confirms a **$533M** plan to recover critical minerals from coal‚Äërelated materials, but **no credible public tonnage** supports ‚Äúa few Mt of REO concentrate.‚Äù That claim should be **deleted** or clearly labeled **speculative** until bankable studies are published. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-rare-earths.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Canada:** The **SRC Rare Earth Processing Facility** in Saskatchewan is a **processing demonstration** (NdPr oxide and eventually metal), not a mine; capacities are **pilot/early‚Äëcommercial** scale. Upstream Canadian REE mines for 2030 remain **uncertain**. Your ‚Äúfew kt/yr REO by 2030‚Äù for Canada is **possible** but **unproven**; cite project‚Äëspecific NI 43‚Äë101s when available. [Annual Reports](https://www.annualreports.com/HostedData/AnnualReportArchive/n/ASX_NTU_2019.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Australia:** In addition to Mt Weld, **Iluka‚Äôs Eneabba refinery (WA)** is under construction; third‚Äëparty and company materials indicate **\~23,000 t/yr separated REO capacity** when complete, including **\~4 kt/yr NdPr and \~0.75 kt/yr Dy+Tb** in some planning cases. First product is targeted in the **mid‚Äëto‚Äëlate 2020s** (variously 2026‚Äì2027 in recent updates). This materially expands allied **processing** capacity (not mine tonnage). [Fluor](https://www.fluor.com/projects/iluka-rare-earths?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The Australian Mining Review](https://australianminingreview.com.au/issue/2025/04/rare-earths-revolution-ilukas-eneabba-refinery/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Listcorp](https://www.listcorp.com/asx/ilu/iluka-resources-limited/news/eneabba-rare-earths-refinery-update-presentation-3127414.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Company Announcements](https://company-announcements.afr.com/asx/ilu/9c42bb53-e936-11ed-9428-f6ba9bacc4fd.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **EU/Norway:** Mining by 2030 is **uncertain**. REN‚Äôs **Fen** resource (8.8 Mt TREO) is promising but **still an inferred resource**; permitting/build‚Äëout will likely push first production into the **2030s**. Processing: **Solvay \~4,000 t/yr** separated REOs is active; **REEtec \~720 t/yr NdPr** is ramping. These help **NdPr** more than **Sm** specifically. [MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/rare-earths-norway-says-its-ree-discovery-is-europes-largest/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/race-regain-rare-earth-glory-europe-falls-short-mineral-goals-2024-06-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[TechMet Ltd](https://www.techmet.com/assets/reetec/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What that means for Sm volumes in 2030:**  
 Even if allied mine **REO** output (U.S.+Australia+Canada) surpasses **\~150‚Äì170 kt REO/yr**, the **Sm share** of that stream is **small** (often **\~1‚Äì2% of TREO** in LREE‚Äëdominant deposits; exact ratios vary by ore and circuit). Without **dedicated midstream circuits** to **separate and refine Sm**, **available Sm‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ** will remain **‚Äúhundreds of tonnes per year‚Äù scale** for allied users ‚Äî **not** multi‚Äëkilotons ‚Äî and still **tight relative to defense/aerospace pull**. (This is an inference from deposit chemistry and today‚Äôs separation focus; it aligns with the small scale of the SmCo magnet market compared with NdFeB.) [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)

**Edit to your text:** The line ‚ÄúSumming announced projects suggests allied capacity on the order of 100‚Äì200 kt/yr LCE ‚Ä¶ for Sm‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply (that LCE framing is lithium‚Äëspecific). For samarium/REE, replace with a **Sm‚Äëspecific** statement emphasizing **minor‚Äëelement recovery** and **separation bottlenecks**, not bulk REO tonnage.

## **5\) Discovery, extraction, separation & remediation ‚Äî technical notes**

Most of your technology descriptions are **directionally correct**, but tighten the sourcing and remove a few over‚Äëconfident claims:

* **Exploration geophysics:** Radiometrics, gravity, and magnetics are indeed standard for REE targeting; treat vendor blogs as *illustrative*, not definitive sources. Consider citing a government/GS document (e.g., GA/USGS) for best practice. (Your MAJR Resources links are acceptable as examples.)

* **Hyperspectral ‚ÄúNd feature‚Äù:** Hyperspectral can map REE‚Äërelated alteration; keep claims conservative unless you cite a peer‚Äëreviewed case that specifically resolved Nd/Sm features in the field.

* **Processing:**

  * **Flotation of bastn√§site/monazite** and **acid baking/caustic digests** are standard.

  * **SX:** Your D2EHPA example is supported (near‚Äëquantitative Ce/La/Nd extraction from monazite tailings leachates in staged systems). [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/8/948?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Sm metal production:** Industrially, Sm is produced via **molten‚Äësalt electrolysis of SmCl‚ÇÉ in LiCl‚ÄìKCl** or **metallothermic reduction under vacuum** with **condensation (distillative) purification** ‚Äî the general routes you describe are consistent with the literature. [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12613-020-2112-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Sci-Hub](https://moscow.sci-hub.box/1325/d37cb8a3160a145332cd3187a57d8571/10.1016%40j.electacta.2011.07.059.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Environmental practice:** MP‚Äôs site is **net‚Äëzero discharge** and **recycles ‚âà95% of process water**; that example is correctly framed. [MP Materials+1](https://mpmaterials.com/sustainability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## **6\) Bottleneck ‚Äî is your conclusion right?**

* **Yes ‚Äî the key bottleneck is midstream separation/refining (and magnets), not geology.** China still dominates **separation and magnet manufacturing**. The West is adding capacity (**Solvay France \~4 kt/yr separated REOs; REEtec Norway \~720 t/yr NdPr; MP begins NdPr metal & trial magnets; Iluka‚Äôs Eneabba refinery** coming) but Sm‚Äëspecific lines remain **limited**, so **Sm‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ/Sm metal availability** in allied markets will **stay tight** without targeted separation trains and magnet alloy capacity.

### **Final verdict**

* Your **overall conclusion** ‚Äî that the **bottleneck is midstream separation/refining (and magnets), not geology** ‚Äî is **correct**.

* The **biggest fixes** are: (i) don‚Äôt equate **REO tonnage with Sm output**; (ii) update **Australia** to \~**113 kt REO** (2024) and note Browns Range‚Äôs **pilot** status; (iii) correct **EU/Norway** (no mining yet; **Fen** is a resource); (iv) replace the **U.S. ‚Äú30% magnet‚Äù** policy claim with the **EU CRMA** targets or remove; and (v) **strike** the unsubstantiated ‚Äúfew Mt REO‚Äù claim for Ramaco.

* **Global scale:** Your ‚Äú\~30 t/y global production‚Äù is broadly right, but **South Africa‚Äôs mine output was \~17‚Äì18 t (not \~27 t)** in 2023‚Äì24. Johnson Matthey (JM) reports **global primary rhodium supply 21.8 t** in 2023, **secondary (recycled) 8.9 t**, **total 30.7 t**; South Africa‚Äôs mine share was **17.4 t** (‚âà80% of primary). [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

* **North America today:** You materially **understate North American mine output.** JM shows **North American primary rhodium supply \~0.6 t in 2023** and **\~0.5 t in 2024** (US \+ Canada). Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) data imply **\~3,000 oz (\~0.093 t) of Canadian rhodium** in 2023, so **the United States contributes the remainder (\~0.4‚Äì0.5 t)**‚Äînot ‚Äúzero.‚Äù [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)[mmsd.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://mmsd.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/prod-prod/ann-ann-eng.aspx)[Natural Resources Canada](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Demand & recycling:** Your 2030 demand ranges are plausible directionally, but **your allied supply estimate (3‚Äì5 t/y including recycling) is too low.** JM notes **\~9.2 t** of rhodium came from recycling globally in 2024 and that **\~43% of recycled rhodium came from vehicles first sold in North America**‚Äîalready ‚âà**4 t** tied to the NA fleet **today**. That means allied supply (mined \+ recycled) is likely **well above 3‚Äì5 t** barring a structural collapse in scrappage. [matthey.com+1](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

* **Process flow:** The statement that new North American projects (e.g., Marathon) may use **HPAL/pressure oxidation instead of smelting/flotation** is **incorrect**. Marathon‚Äôs NI 43‚Äë101 FS specifies a **conventional crush‚Äìgrind‚Äìflotation Cu‚ÄëPGM concentrate** flowsheet (concentrate then smelting/refining), not HPAL. [International Mining](https://im-mining.com/2021/03/03/gen-mining-reports-positive-fs-marathon-palladium-copper-project-including-use-woodgrove-direct-flotation-reactors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wheaton Precious Metals](https://www.wheatonpm.com/portfolio/development-projects/marathon/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Key bottleneck:** Your main conclusion‚Äîthat **geology (lack of a large allied orebody) and dependence on imports/recycling, not ‚Äúmissing lab tech,‚Äù is the choke point**‚Äîis sound. USGS confirms **only one US company** mines PGMs and JM shows **SA dominates primary supply.** [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-platinum-group.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

# Rhodium

## **Detailed fact check**

### **US & allies ‚Äì current production**

* **United States:**  
   *Claim:* ‚ÄúThe United States reported no rhodium output in 2023.‚Äù  
   *Check:* JM‚Äôs regional table shows **North America primary rhodium supply \~0.6 t in 2023, \~0.5 t in 2024**. NRCan‚Äôs breakdown puts Canada near **0.093 t** (see below), leaving **\~0.4‚Äì0.5 t** attributable to the US (rhodium in Stillwater/East Boulder concentrates). In other words, **US rhodium output is small, but not zero.** [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)[mmsd.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://mmsd.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/prod-prod/ann-ann-eng.aspx)  
   USGS also notes **one company in Montana mined and processed PGMs** in 2024‚Äîconsistent with that interpretation. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-platinum-group.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
   Sibanye‚ÄëStillwater reports **425,842 oz 2E (Pt+Pd) in 2024**, with smelting/refining at its **Columbus, MT** complex, and confirms the tailings/backfill practices you mention. [Sibanye-Stillwater](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/)

* **Canada:**  
   *Claim:* ‚Äú\~3,000 oz Rh (‚âà0.093 t) in 2023.‚Äù  
   *Check:* NRCan ‚ÄúPlatinum facts‚Äù gives Canada‚Äôs 2023 total PGM output (\~702,000 oz) and shows **rhodium \~0.4%** of Canadian PGM production, which is ‚âà**3,000 oz**. This aligns with your number. (The NRCan page shows the 0.4% split; the ‚ÄúPlatinum group quantity produced‚Äù table shows **23,210,854 g of PGMs** in 2024p; 0.4% of that order of magnitude maps to \~3,000 oz.) [Natural Resources Canada+1](https://natural-resources.canada.ca/minerals-mining/mining-data-statistics-analysis/minerals-metals-facts/platinum-facts?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[mmsd.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca](https://mmsd.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/prod-prod/ann-ann-eng.aspx)  
   Note: Lac des Iles is now **Impala Canada** (acquired in 2019), not ‚ÄúNorth American Palladium.‚Äù (That naming update doesn‚Äôt affect your quantity.) [blog.gorozen.com](https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/the-hidden-revival-of-platinum-and-palladium)

* **Australia / EU / Japan / Nordics:**  
   *Claim:* ‚ÄúNo rhodium mines.‚Äù  
   *Check:* Correct in practice: there is **no material primary rhodium mine production** in these allied regions at present (refining exists, mining doesn‚Äôt). USGS and JM attribute primary rhodium supply overwhelmingly to **South Africa**, plus **Russia and Zimbabwe**, with a small North American contribution. [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)[U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-platinum-group.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Global context & South Africa:**  
   *Claim:* ‚ÄúGlobal mine output \~30 t, South Africa \~26.9 t in 2023.‚Äù  
   *Check:* **Partly right, partly wrong.** JM shows **global primary (mine) supply 21.8 t** and **secondary 8.9 t** in 2023, for **\~30.7 t total supply**. But **South Africa‚Äôs primary was 17.4 t**‚Äî**not** \~26.9 t. Your SA figure is overstated by \~55%. (SA‚Äôs share ‚âà80% of primary supply.) [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

**Verdict:** Revise ‚ÄúUS zero‚Äù ‚Üí **US \~0.4‚Äì0.5 t** (within **NA \~0.6 t**), and revise ‚ÄúSouth Africa 26.9 t‚Äù ‚Üí **\~17‚Äì18 t**.

---

### **US & allies ‚Äì demand to 2030**

* **Magnitude & mix:**  
   Rhodium demand is still dominated by **autocatalysts**, with smaller shares in **chemical (nitric/acetic)**, **glass**, and **electronics**. JM reports **global rhodium demand 34.7 t (2023)** and **33.1 t (2024)**; it expects **another modest deficit** in 2025, with glass demand rebounding somewhat despite lower auto consumption. [matthey.com+1](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

* **North America signal:**  
   JM explicitly notes **‚Äúimported cars sold in the USA accounted for well over 100,000 oz of rhodium use last year \[2024\]‚Äù**‚Äî**\>3.1 t** **from imports alone**, before counting US‚Äëbuilt vehicles and non‚Äëauto uses. That supports your directional claim that **NA demand is several tonnes per year** and gives context for 2030 ranges. [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM_Market_Report_25.pdf/5f4e4078-8e9a-3c96-d334-9d14da9de094?t=1747159713413)

* **Your 2030 ranges:**  
   Your ‚ÄúNA \~7 t, Europe \~5 t, Japan \~2 t; allies \~10‚Äì15 t‚Äù is **plausible as an order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude scenario**, but it‚Äôs **not sourced to a single forecast** and should be framed as an **illustrative scenario**‚Äîespecially because **BEV penetration, loadings (Euro 7, US Tier 3 completion), and thrifting** could push auto demand **down**, while **glass/chemical cycles** could push **up**. JM‚Äôs latest narrative points to **slightly lower automotive rhodium in 2025** but **glass turning positive**‚Äîit does **not** publish a 2030 rhodium by‚Äëregion forecast in the public report. [matthey.com+1](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Verdict:** Keep the ranges, but mark them as **scenario estimates**, anchored to **JM‚Äôs current totals (‚âà33 t global)** with uncertainty around EV adoption and loadings.

---

### **US & allies ‚Äì supply to 2030**

* **Primary (mined) supply:**  
   With no large new allied PGM mines, **primary allied rhodium output is likely to remain small** (stillwater/East Boulder in the US; Lac des Iles & potential new Canadian projects if they proceed). That said, **‚ÄúNorth America ‚â™0.1 t‚Äù** is **inaccurate**‚Äîwe are already at **\~0.5‚Äì0.6 t** primary. [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

* **Secondary (recycling):**  
   Your estimate of **global recycling at \~10 t/y** is a bit high; JM has **8.9 t (2023)** and **9.2 t (2024)**. Crucially, **\~43%** of recycled rhodium in 2024 came from **vehicles first sold in North America**, i.e., **‚âà4 t** associated with the NA fleet alone. This single datum means **allied supply (mined+recycled)** will likely **exceed 3‚Äì5 t/y** in any normal scrappage environment. [matthey.com+1](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

* **Bottom line:**  
   You‚Äôre directionally right that **allies will remain import‚Äëdependent**, but the **best‚Äëcase 3‚Äì5 t/y (mined \+ recycled)** you cite is **too low** against the current recycling base. A more defensible framing is: **primary allied supply \~0.5‚Äì0.7 t/y**, **secondary allied supply ‚Äúseveral tonnes‚Äù (‚âà4‚Äì6 t/y) depending on scrappage and price**, for a **total allied supply plausibly in the mid‚Äësingle‚Äëdigit tonnes**‚Äîstill **well below** a **10‚Äì15 t/y** allied demand scenario. [matthey.com+1](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

### **Technologies (discovery ‚Üí extraction ‚Üí separation ‚Üí remediation)**

* **Exploration (geophysics, geochem, mapping):**  
   Your summary fits standard PGM exploration practice (magnetics+gravity for layered mafic/ultramafic intrusions; geochem and structural mapping in cratons). Provincial surveys (e.g., Manitoba) emphasize these approaches for PGE targets. [blog.gorozen.com](https://blog.gorozen.com/blog/the-hidden-revival-of-platinum-and-palladium?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Extraction/processing:**  
   *Correct:* comminution \+ **flotation** ‚Üí **smelting/converting** ‚Üí hydrometallurgy for PGMs (as at Sibanye‚ÄëStillwater/Columbus). [Sibanye-Stillwater](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/americas/pgm-operations-americas/stillwater-east-boulder/)  
   *Needs correction:* **Marathon** (Ontario) does **not** plan HPAL/POX for PGMs; the FS specifies **conventional Cu‚ÄëPGM flotation** with Cu‚ÄëPGM concentrate off‚Äëtake for smelting/refining. [International Mining](https://im-mining.com/2021/03/03/gen-mining-reports-positive-fs-marathon-palladium-copper-project-including-use-woodgrove-direct-flotation-reactors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Wheaton Precious Metals](https://www.wheatonpm.com/portfolio/development-projects/marathon/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Separation/refining:**  
   *Accurate in essence.* Industrial routes use **solvent extraction** and **ion exchange** on chloride liquors; **selective precipitation** of **ammonium hexachlororhodate, (NH‚ÇÑ)‚ÇÉ\[RhCl‚ÇÜ\]**, is a classical rhodium step, followed by **calcination/reduction** to metal. Modern reviews and resin vendor literature support the ion‚Äëexchange/SX details you give (Lewatit, etc.).

* **Remediation:**  
   Paste backfill/tailings management and water treatment references are consistent with operator disclosures. Sibanye‚ÄëStillwater states **\~52% of concentrator tailings returned underground at Stillwater**; East Boulder is \~44%.

# Lutetium

## **Bottom‚Äëline assessment of your conclusions**

* **‚ÄúUS/allied primary rhodium supply is tiny and import‚Äëdependent.‚Äù** ‚úîÔ∏è Correct (but quantify NA primary at \~0.5‚Äì0.6 t/y, not ‚Äú‚â™0.1 t‚Äù). [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM-Market-Report-24.pdf)

* **‚ÄúRecycling will be crucial.‚Äù** ‚úîÔ∏è Correct‚Äîand already on the order of **\~4 t/y tied to the NA fleet** today. [matthey.com](https://matthey.com/documents/161599/509428/PGM_Market_Report_25.pdf/5f4e4078-8e9a-3c96-d334-9d14da9de094?t=1747159713413)

* **‚ÄúTech isn‚Äôt the main choke point; it‚Äôs resources & scale.‚Äù** ‚úîÔ∏è Correct. Even with advanced hydromet routes, without a **new, large allied orebody** the allied share of **primary** rhodium won‚Äôt move much; **recycling and imports** bridge the gap.

## **Quick verdict (what‚Äôs most off vs. solid)**

**Most off (needs correction):**

* **U.S. current REO output at Mountain Pass** is far higher than ‚Äúseveral hundred tonnes‚Äù‚ÄîUSGS reports **\~45,000 t REO (concentrate) in 2024**, and Mountain Pass is a **light‚ÄëREE (LREE) bastn√§site** system with **negligible heavy REE (HREE) content** such as lutetium. That means **U.S. primary Lu is effectively \~zero**, not hundreds of tonnes. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)[USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/complex-carbonate-ore-mineralogy-mountain-pass-carbonatite-rare-earth-element-deposit?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136824003871?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Global scale for lutetium** is small. Widely cited technical/industry references put **global Lu‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ output on the order of \~10 t/yr**, not hundreds. EU data show **EU Lu consumption \~5.6 t/yr (metal content)** in 2016‚Äì2020, underscoring that this market is measured in **single‚Äëdigit to tens of tonnes globally**‚Äînot in the hundreds. Your figures of **\~600‚Äì700 t/y** (U.S.) and **100‚Äì150 t/y allied Lu by 2030** are **orders of magnitude too high**. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutetium?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Lenntech](https://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/lu.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Procurement Resource](https://www.procurementresource.com/reports/lutetium-oxide-manufacturing-plant-project-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[scrreen.eu](https://scrreen.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCRREEN2_factsheets_REE-EUROSTAT.pdf)

* **Medical Lu‚Äë177 demand ‚â† tonnage‚Äëscale Lu feedstock.** Radiopharmaceutical demand is growing quickly, but it is measured in **activity (GBq/Ci) and grams‚Äìkilograms per year**, not tens or hundreds of tonnes of lutetium. Your inference that a multi‚Äëbillion‚Äëdollar Lu‚Äë177 market implies ‚Äútens of tonnes‚Äù of Lu is **not supported**. Technical reviews discuss supply risk and rising capacity, but not tonnage‚Äëscale mass needs.

**Largely sound (with nuance):**

* **Midstream bottleneck**: You‚Äôre right that **separation/refining capacity** (especially outside China for HREEs) is the chokepoint. Western projects are being built, but **HREE separation at meaningful scale is still limited**.

* **Australia and EU projects**: Lynas (Mt Weld), Iluka (Eneabba HREE refinery, 2027), Solvay (France), REEtec (Norway) are real and relevant; timelines are 2025‚Äì2027+ and mostly focused on NdPr/Dy/Tb, with **Lu streams tiny** unless feed has meaningful xenotime.

## **Corrected facts & numbers**

### **US & allied current production of lutetium (2024‚Äì2025)**

* **United States (Mountain Pass, CA)**

  * **Actual REO output**: USGS reports **\~45,000 t REO (mineral concentrates) in 2024**. However, Mountain Pass is a **bastn√§site LREE deposit** (Ce‚ÄìLa‚ÄìNd‚ÄìPr dominant). **HREE (including Lu) are present only in trace amounts** and are **not a meaningful product stream** today. Practical takeaway: **U.S. primary Lu production ‚âà zero**. [U.S. Geological Survey Publications](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf)[USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/complex-carbonate-ore-mineralogy-mountain-pass-carbonatite-rare-earth-element-deposit?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136824003871?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Australia (Lynas Mt Weld; Iluka stockpiles/refinery)**

  * Lynas FY2024 **total REO production was \~10,908 t**, heavily skewed to LREE; historic data show Mt Weld central ore is **LREE‚Äëenriched**, with Dy/Tb already **minor**‚Äîand Lu a **trace** fraction of HREE. Australia‚Äôs **current Lu output is likely at most kilograms to (low) hundreds of kilograms per year**, not 10‚Äì20 t/yr.

* **Canada / EU / Norway / Japan**

  * **No primary Lu mining**. The EU has some **separation capacity** (e.g., Solvay France; Neo/Estonia) for certain streams, but **no significant domestic Lu mine output** today. Norway‚Äôs Fen project is exploration‚Äëstage; REEtec targets NdPr first. Japan has **no Lu mining**; seabed trials (Minamitori) are **planned for 2026 pilot**, not production. [Reuters+2Reuters+2](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Bottom line:** **Allied primary production of Lu today is negligible**; Lu is recovered mainly as **tiny fractions** within broader RE processing streams, much of which are still processed in or via China.

### **US & allied demand by 2030 (order of magnitude)**

* **EU benchmark today:** The EU‚Äôs official CRM factsheet (SCRREEN/EUROSTAT) reports **EU Lu consumption \~5.61 t/yr (metal content)** for 2016‚Äì2020. This is a rare, quantitative anchor point. [scrreen.eu](https://scrreen.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SCRREEN2_factsheets_REE-EUROSTAT.pdf)

* **Global production context:** Commonly cited figures put **global Lu‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ production ‚âà10 t/yr** (order of magnitude). That aligns with the EU figure above (EU \~5‚Äì6 t metal ‚âà \~6‚Äì7 t Lu‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ using \~88% Lu in Lu‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ) and suggests **global totals are single‚Äëdigit to low‚Äëtens of tonnes**‚Äî**not** hundreds.

* **Medical Lu‚Äë177 growth:** Demand is rising fast (PSMA and NET therapies), but **mass requirements remain grams‚Äìkilograms per year globally**, scaled by reactor capacity and specific activity‚Äînot by bulk lutetium tonnage. Expect **meaningful growth in value**, **modest growth in mass**. [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8241800/)[itm-radiopharma.com](https://www.itm-radiopharma.com/news/press-releases/press-releases-detail/itm-opens-worlds-largest-lutetium-177-production-facility-for-targeted-radionuclide-therapies-against-cancer-644/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Corrected 2030 allied demand range:**

* Using the **EU baseline (\~5‚Äì6 t/yr metal content)** and assuming **U.S. \+ UK \+ Japan \+ others** are in the same order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude, a **reasonable allied total** for 2030 is **\~10‚Äì20 t/yr Lu (metal content)**, **not 60‚Äì100 t**. This is deliberately a range because Lu uses outside medicine (e.g., scintillators, optics) are niche and hard to quantify. The **value** of Lu‚Äë177 markets can grow several‚Äëfold without implying large increases in **mass**.

### **US & allied supply by 2030 (order of magnitude)**

* **Mines:** Expect **continued LREE‚Äëheavy output** from Mountain Pass and Mt Weld; neither is a material Lu source absent xenotime‚Äërich feed. New Western projects (e.g., Fen, Norra K√§rr) are **unlikely to contribute Lu at scale by 2030** (per public timelines).

However, expected Lu volumes remain **very small**. [Iluka resources](https://iluka.com/operations-resource-development/resource-development/eneabba/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Recycling:** Helps NdPr/Dy/Tb far more than Lu; **Lu recycling by 2030 remains minor**. [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/companies-forging-rare-earths-industry-eu-2024-06-27/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Corrected 2030 allied Lu supply view:**

* **Primary (mined) Lu in allies:** **‚âà zero to low‚Äëhundreds of kilograms per year** (heavily contingent on xenotime‚Äërich feeds and actual heavy‚Äëseparation operations), not multi‚Äëtonne.

* **Separated Lu from allied refineries (processing imported concentrates)**: possibly **\~1‚Äì5 t/yr** if multiple plants run HREE circuits and can secure xenotime‚Äëbearing feedstock‚Äîstill **uncertain** and **feed‚Äëlimited**.

* **Total allied supply (primary \+ processing of non‚ÄëChinese feed \+ minor recycling):** **low single‚Äëdigit to mid‚Äësingle‚Äëdigit tonnes per year** is a defensible working range for 2030‚Äînot 100‚Äì150 t/yr. (This range is consistent with global totals being in the single‚Äëdigit/low‚Äëtens of tonnes.)

## **Technology sections (accuracy check)**

* **Exploration (radiometrics, mapping, geochem, hyperspectral)** ‚Äî **Accurate in principle** for REEs. Add the nuance that **Lu** rides with **xenotime (YPO‚ÇÑ)** and other HREE‚Äërich minerals; **radiometrics flag U/Th‚Äëbearing monazite**, whereas **xenotime** may be less radiogenic.

## **US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)**

**United States**

* **‚ö†Ô∏è Output level:** MP Materials‚Äô Mountain Pass is indeed the *only* operating U.S. rare‚Äëearth mine. But your throughput figure is too low. MP reported **41,557 t REO in concentrate in 2023** and **45,455 t in 2024**, not \~13‚Äì14 kt/y. (Your 10,766 t was Q3‚Äëonly.)

**Bottom line on current allied Tb:**

* The U.S. and allies **mine a lot of LREE** (e.g., U.S. \~45 kt REO in 2024), **but virtually no Tb is produced domestically today**; heavy‚Äëoxide separation is the missing step.

* **‚ùå EV/wind Tb per unit:** The statement ‚Äúa 3 MW wind turbine ‚âà2 kg Tb‚Äù and ‚Äúa typical EV ‚âà0.5‚Äì1 kg Tb‚Äù is **orders of magnitude too high**. Modern NdFeB magnets have **sharply reduced heavy‚ÄëREE (Dy/Tb) content** via **grain‚Äëboundary diffusion and microstructure control**; many EV/wind designs now use **little or no Tb at all** (Dy is more commonly used when needed).

* **‚ö†Ô∏è Demand scale:** A solid, public datapoint: the **EU‚Äôs Tb consumption averaged \~1.6 t/yr (metal equivalent)** in recent years‚Äîthis anchors the order of magnitude. Projecting forward with EV/wind growth and continued thrifting, **allied Tb demand in 2030 is likely in the *tens of tonnes per year*, not ‚Äútens of thousands.‚Äù**

* **‚úÖ Sectors:** Key Tb uses (magnet coercivity at high T, select phosphors, niche ceramics) are right; **magnet demand dominates** among industrial uses.

**Corrected 2030 allied demand view:**

* **Order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude:** **\~10‚Äì40 t/y Tb (metal equivalent)** for the U.S.+EU+Japan combined looks plausible, depending on **magnet chemistry choices** and **continued HRE thrifting** (large uncertainty).

## **Key Discovery Technologies**

Your list broadly matches industry practice. A few refinements:

* **‚úÖ Radiometrics, magnetics & gravity, hyperspectral, mapping/geochem, drilling/logging**‚Äîall correctly described and relevant for REE targeting (including HREE). [smedg.org.au](https://smedg.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Hellman%20and%20Duncan%20REE%20Paper_2017.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/13/5/656?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **‚ö†Ô∏è Ion‚Äëadsorption clays:** Where Tb is found with Dy (Browns Range style is hard‚Äërock, but many HREE sources globally include clays), **IP/resistivity and soil/till geochem grids** are indeed useful; keep that nuance. (General practice references as above.)

* **‚ö†Ô∏è HPAL/pressure options:** These exist for specific feeds (less common for Tb‚Äërich xenotime but under study). The general framing is fine.

## **Key Separation Technologies**

* **‚úÖ Solvent extraction (SX)** remains the **workhorse** for splitting REEs into groups and individuals, incl. Tb later in the train. **Ion exchange** is used for polishing/specialty purity. Good. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892687513003452?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **‚ö†Ô∏è Novel membranes/ionic liquids:** promising at lab/pilot scale; **not commercial at Tb scale** yet. Your caveat is fine.

## **Key Purification & Refinement Technologies**

* **‚úÖ Oxalate/carbonate precipitation \+ calcination** to high‚Äëpurity oxides, then **metallothermic (Ca/Al) reduction** or **molten‚Äësalt routes** to metal‚Äîaccurate.

* **‚úÖ Zone refining / vacuum melting** for ultra‚Äëhigh purity‚Äîaccurate for niche Tb use.

(For recovery/precipitation from solutions/effluents, **sequential precipitation** and **oxalate routes** are documented; purity depends on feed and conditions‚Äîclaims like ‚Äú\>94% RE purity‚Äù are case‚Äëspecific but directionally reasonable as *process demonstrations*.)

## **Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production**

* **‚úÖ Core point (processing):** The chief chokepoint is **midstream separation of heavy REEs (Dy/Tb)**. DOE‚Äôs supply‚Äëchain work shows **near‚Äëtotal reliance on China** for heavy‚Äëoxide separation; this is why even substantial allied mining today yields **almost no domestically separated Tb**.

* **‚úÖ 2030 outlook:** **Iluka‚Äôs Eneabba** (commissioning 2027\) is the **first credible ex‚ÄëChina heavy‚ÄëREE separation hub** likely to produce Tb oxide at useful scale‚Äî**if fed** with HREE‚Äërich concentrates (e.g., Browns Range).

**Bottleneck summary (tightened):**  
 Allied Tb supply is limited far more by **heavy‚ÄëREE separation capacity** than by geology. U.S./Australian mines overwhelmingly produce **LREE‚Äërich** concentrates; **Tb is trace** and requires **long SX trains** to isolate. With **heavy separation \~100% in China**, allied Tb output will remain **small** until projects like **Iluka Eneabba** (2027+) and **HREE‚Äërich mines** (e.g., Browns Range) ramp and pair up.

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)**

**Where Dy is used.** Dysprosium is a **coercivity improver** in Nd‚ÄëFe‚ÄëB magnets for **EV traction motors** and **direct‚Äëdrive wind‚Äëturbine generators** (high‚Äëtemperature stability), plus smaller volumes in electronics, defense and other high‚Äëtech uses. **Grain‚Äëboundary diffusion (GBD)** and hot‚Äëdeformation have **thrifted** Dy per magnet, but not eliminated it in high‚Äëtemp duty cycles. [The Department of Energy's Energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Neodymium%2520Magnets%2520Supply%2520Chain%2520Report%2520-%2520Final%5B1%5D.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Innovate UK Business Connect](https://iuk-business-connect.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IUK-Climate-Magnet-Manufacturing-Report-TW-D4-compressed.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Ideal Magnet Solutions](https://idealmagnetsolutions.com/knowledge-base/grain-boundary-diffusion/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Anchors for a grounded range (not a single point forecast):**

## **Key Bottleneck Technology for US & Allies**

**Mid‚Äëstream HREE separation capacity**‚Äîspecifically, **commercial‚Äëscale SX tailored to heavy REEs (Dy/Tb)**‚Äîis the chokepoint. The U.S. DOE notes **heavy‚ÄëREE separation is concentrated in China**; allied facilities are only now coming online (Iluka Eneabba; Energy Fuels‚Äô ramp; small EU capacity). Even when mines exist, **without HREE SX/refinery capacity** allied producers cannot deliver **battery‚Äëgrade Dy‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ** at scale. Supply risk is compounded by **Myanmar disruptions**. [The Department of Energy's Energy.gov](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Neodymium%2520Magnets%2520Supply%2520Chain%2520Report%2520-%2520Final%5B1%5D.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Iluka resources](https://www.iluka.com/media/d5gjznmn/iluka-resources-macquarie-australia-conference-may-2025.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-rebels-disrupt-china-rare-earth-trade-sparking-regional-scramble-2025-03-28/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences).**

Allied dysprosium supply is ultimately constrained by **separation** and **feedstock risk**. If Eneabba and White Mesa ramp as planned and Browns Range/Donald feed arrives, the allies can reach **low‚Äëhundreds of tons/year of Dy oxide** by \~2030‚Äîbut schedule, feed quality, and recoveries are genuine risks. Meanwhile, **EV/wind growth** can easily absorb that volume even under aggressive **Dy thrifting**. Absent faster build‚Äëout of **HREE SX capacity** (and robust recycling), allied markets will remain **import‚Äëdependent** for Dy through 2030\.

[USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-gallium.pdf)

### **Bottleneck summary (tightened)**

Despite abundant gallium in bauxite and zinc streams, **very few allied refineries have Ga recovery lines**, so most Ga **is not captured**. The fix is **capex \+ process integration** (IX/SX \+ electrowinning \+ refining) at alumina plants. Even with **Canada (\~40 t/yr)** and **Greece (\~50 t/yr)** online by \~2027‚Äì2030, **allied supply** will likely trail **allied demand** by a wide margin, keeping **import reliance** high without broader roll‚Äëout.

## **US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)**

**United States**

* **Primary refinery production:** **None.** USGS lists U.S. primary refinery production as ‚Äú‚Äî‚Äù (zero) in 2020‚Äì2024. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

* **Upstream concentrates:** In **2024**, **zinc concentrates containing germanium** were produced at a mine in **Alaska**; some of this concentrate was exported to **Canada** for germanium recovery. A **Tennessee** zinc mine that previously produced Ge‚Äëbearing concentrates **remained suspended**. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

* **Domestic midstream (from imported/recycled feed):** One U.S. company in **St. George, Utah** makes **germanium wafers** (mostly for space solar cells) and one in **Quapaw, Oklahoma** produces **GeCl‚ÇÑ** for fiber optics‚Äî**both from imported and recycled germanium**. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

* **Trade baseline (2024):** **Imports ‚âà33 t Ge content** (metal \~20 t \+ dioxide \~13 t); **net import reliance \>50%** of consumption. In **Dec 2024, China banned all exports of germanium to the United States**, underscoring supply risk. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

**Canada**

* **Active producer/refiner:** **Teck Trail (BC)** is one of the world‚Äôs major integrated germanium producers, recovering **GeO‚ÇÇ** and **GeCl‚ÇÑ** from zinc smelting streams. Canada supplied **\~41% of U.S. GeO‚ÇÇ imports (2020‚Äì23)**, indicating significant capacity.

**European Union / UK / Norway / Iceland**

* **Belgium (Umicore):** Global leader in **Ge refining/recycling** (GeCl‚ÇÑ, GeO‚ÇÇ, metal) including **optical‚Äëfiber grade GeCl‚ÇÑ**; also expanding germanium feed via **recycling and tailings**. [eom.umicore.com+2eom.umicore.com+2](https://eom.umicore.com/en/germanium-solutions/markets/telecom-optical-fibre/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Japan**

* **Production:** Not identified by USGS among current producing countries; Japan remains a **major consumer/processor** relying on imports, with strong downstream applications (optics, electronics). [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

**Australia / Norway / Iceland**

**Summary (today):** Within the allies, **Canada, Belgium, and Germany** are the meaningful **producers/refiners** of germanium. The **U.S.** produces **Ge‚Äëbearing concentrates** and does **midstream processing from imported/recycled feed**, but **no primary refinery production**. **China remains the leading global producer and exporter**; export **licensing began Aug‚Äë2023** and **exports to the U.S. were banned Dec‚Äë2024**, materially tightening allied supply options.

## **US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)**

* **Canada (Teck Trail):** Expect **continued refined Ge output** (GeO‚ÇÇ/GeCl‚ÇÑ), potentially with incremental improvements tied to zinc throughput and process optimization. Canada has been a **top supplier** of GeO‚ÇÇ to the U.S. and will likely remain so through 2030\.

  * **Germany:** Continued **refining/processing** capability (Vital PMS Langelsheim). [VPMS](https://www.vital-pms.de/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **United States:** **No announced primary refinery** projects.

U.S. upstream **Ge‚Äëbearing zinc concentrates** likely continue (Alaska), but **refining is offshore**. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

* **Recycling:** Globally, **\~30%** of germanium consumed has historically been met by **recycled material**; allied gains by 2030 are most likely from **expanded recycling of optics/fiber/wafer scrap** plus increased **closed‚Äëloop capture** at fiber plants. (Quantities vary with price and scrap availability.) [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2020/mcs2020-germanium.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude outlook (2030):** Summing **Canada \+ EU** primary/recycled production available to allies, plus U.S. **secondary (recycling) and midstream**, suggests an allied supply envelope on the order of **\~60‚Äì100 t/yr** (Ge content) by 2030‚Äî**still below** the **\~80‚Äì140 t/yr** allied demand range, implying **continued reliance on imports** (non‚ÄëChina where feasible) or further recycling gains.

## **Key Bottleneck Technology for US and Allies Domestic Production**

* **By‚Äëproduct dependency & smelter integration:** Germanium is **not mined as a primary ore**; recovery depends on **zinc smelter** flowsheets (and, to a lesser extent, coal ash). Many allied smelters **do not operate Ge circuits** at scale, so potential Ge in concentrates and residues **is not captured**. [SFA (Oxford)](https://www.sfa-oxford.com/rare-earths-and-minor-metals/minor-metals-and-minerals/germanium-market-and-germanium-price-drivers/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Policy risk from China:** **Export licensing (Aug‚Äë2023)** and **U.S.‚Äëspecific export ban (Dec‚Äë2024)** created acute supply risk and **price spikes**, highlighting the lack of **redundant allied capacity**. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/price-chinas-strategic-germanium-hits-record-high-possible-state-buying-2024-07-18/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Data opacity & scale:** USGS notes **limited, non‚Äëtransparent global production data**; capital‚Äëintensive SX/IX and chlorination/distillation circuits have been concentrated in **China** and a few allied facilities (**Belgium, Canada**). Building new allied circuits requires **long‚Äëlead capex, feedstock security,** and **environmental permitting**. [USGS Publications Warehouse](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-germanium.pdf)

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Germanium supply for allies is constrained less by geology than by **installed recovery capacity at zinc/coal processing hubs**. Because Ge is a **by‚Äëproduct**, allied output cannot quickly scale without **retrofitting smelters** (SX/IX and GeCl‚ÇÑ/GeO‚ÇÇ lines) or expanding **recycling**. China‚Äôs 2023‚Äì2024 controls (including a **Dec‚Äë2024 U.S. ban**) magnified the risk. Near‚Äëterm mitigation lies in **Canada/EU capacity**, **tailings projects (e.g., DRC‚ÜíBelgium)**, and **closed‚Äëloop recycling**, but a structural fix requires **new allied Ge circuits**.

**What holds up**

* **United States:** ‚Äú0 t‚Äù mine output is **correct**. The US ‚Äúhas not been mined commercially since 2015.‚Äù US supply is powders/carbides/chemicals produced from **imported concentrates/APT** and scrap by a handful of processors; 7 U.S. companies are capable of converting concentrates/APT/oxides/scrap to powder/carbide.

**Corrections / clarifications**

* **Canada:** ‚Äú0 t‚Äù mine production is correct (Cantung idled; Mactung pre‚Äëproduction). Also note the **updated Mactung resource** (not ‚Äú\~290 kt WO‚ÇÉ‚Äù): **41.5 Mt @ 0.73% WO‚ÇÉ indicated (‚âà303 kt WO‚ÇÉ)** and **12.2 Mt @ 0.59% WO‚ÇÉ inferred (‚âà72 kt WO‚ÇÉ)** (2023 NI 43‚Äë101).

* **Australia:** Your ‚Äú\~1,000 t (2024)‚Äù is consistent with **USGS**: **1,000 t W** in 2024\. (Good to state explicitly that this is **tungsten content**.)

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Demand 2030 (tons, tungsten content)**

**Anchors (measured/structural)**

* **By end‚Äëuse region**, ITIA‚Äôs 2021 split of **final end‚Äëuse**: **China 36%**, **Europe 20%**, **Americas 17%**, **Japan 8%**, **Other Asia 8%**, **RoW 11%**. That puts ‚ÄúUS+EU+Japan+Other Asia allies‚Äù around **45‚Äì50%** of global end‚Äëuse, not ‚Äú\~20% after removing China 80%,‚Äù which mixed up **mine production** share with **consumption**. [ITIA](https://www.itia.info/applications-markets/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Global scale:** World mine production **81,000 t (2024)**. USGS notes non‚ÄëChinese mine share **\<20%**, scrap is significant. Consumption varies with industrial activity. [U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2024/mcs2024-tungsten.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Reasonable 2030 range (planning level)**  
 Assuming **low‚Äësingle‚Äëdigit growth** in tooling/specialty alloys and sustained defense demand, global consumption by 2030 plausibly sits in the **80‚Äì95 kt** band. Applying **\~45‚Äì50% allied end‚Äëuse share** implies **\~36‚Äì47 kt** tungsten content demanded across **US \+ Europe \+ Japan \+ other allies** by 2030\. This framing is better supported than a back‚Äëof‚Äëenvelope ‚Äúremove China 80% ‚áí \~14 kt‚Äù estimate. [ITIA](https://www.itia.info/applications-markets/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

*(Takeaway: allied demand is in the **tens of thousands of tonnes**, dominated by cemented carbides/hardmetals; defense is material but smaller.)*

## **Key Bottleneck technology for US & Allies ‚Äî What to change**

**Draft claim (needs correction):**

‚ÄúThe critical bottleneck is downstream processing (APT/powders); virtually all high‚Äëpurity W production is abroad.‚Äù

**What the evidence supports instead:**

* The **primary chokepoints** for allies are (i) **access to non‚ÄëChinese concentrates/APT** (geopolitics: new **export controls on tungsten products**, China \>80% mine output), and (ii) **limited allied mine supply**. **Midstream capacity does exist** in the US/EU (e.g., **GTP (US)**, **Wolfram Austria**, **Kennametal EU/US**), but it is **heavily dependent on imported feed** and scrap. In short, **feedstock availability and policy risk** are the binding constraints; midstream is **not zero**, but needs **expansion** to de‚Äërisk. [Reuters+1](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/what-are-five-new-critical-metal-exports-restricted-by-china-2025-02-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[The Plansee Group](https://plansee-group.com/files/Living.Metals/Pla.LM.2024.25.V4.EN.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[GlobeNewswire](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2009/02/17/15910/0/en/Sandvik-acquires-Austrian-tungsten-producer.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**2‚Äì4 sentence bottleneck summary (revised):**  
 China still accounts for **\>80%** of mine output and has imposed new **export controls** on multiple tungsten products, so the most acute allied bottleneck is **securing non‚ÄëChinese feedstock** (concentrates/APT) at scale. The US and EU do have **established powder/carbide plants**, but they depend on imported concentrates and scrap, meaning **feedstock, not basic processing know‚Äëhow, is the governor**. Near‚Äëterm mitigation is **new allied mines (Sangdong, possible Hemerdon) \+ recycling growth**, coupled with **incremental APT/powder debottlenecking**. Without those, allied mine‚Äëto‚Äëmetal volumes will remain well below allied demand by 2030\.

## **Minimal edits you can drop into your draft**

1. **Units**: State clearly when figures are **tungsten content (W)** vs **WO‚ÇÉ** vs **APT**. When you quote mine output by country, use **USGS W‚Äëcontent** numbers.

2. **Current production section (tighten to USGS):**

* US **0 t** mine output; 7 processors convert imported concentrates/APT/scrap to powders/carbides.

* Australia **1,000 t** (2024). EU: Austria **800 t**, Spain **700 t**, Portugal **500 t**. Canada/Japan/Norway/Iceland **0 t**. Add **ROK 0 t (near‚Äëterm restart at Sangdong)**.

3. **2030 demand**: Replace the ‚Äúremove China=\~14 kt‚Äù logic with **ITIA end‚Äëuse shares**; set allied demand in **\~36‚Äì47 kt** (if world ‚âà80‚Äì95 kt in 2030). [ITIA](https://www.itia.info/applications-markets/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

4. **2030 supply**:

## **Bottom line**

Your overall **direction** (US mine output \= zero; EU/AU small; allies short of demand; need new non‚ÄëChinese sources) is right. The **numbers** should be anchored to **USGS** (for 2024 production by country) and **ITIA** (for regional end‚Äëuse shares). For 2030, present **base vs. upside** supply scenarios (EU+AU \+ Sangdong; \+Hemerdon), and frame the bottleneck as **feedstock access under new controls**, not a total lack of Western processing capacity. This preserves your core message while tightening accuracy and citations.

# Niobium

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Current Production (tons Nb content)**

* **United States:** **0 t** mine production. The U.S. has no active niobium mines; U.S. net import reliance for niobium was **100%** in 2024\.

* **Canada:** **\~7,100 t Nb (2024)** from the **Niobec** underground mine (Qu√©bec) operated by Magris Performance Materials. Canada‚Äôs share was \~6‚Äì7% of world niobium mine output in 2024\.

* **Australia:** **No primary mine production.** Geoscience Australia states there are **no mines producing niobium as a primary product**; any by‚Äëproduct output at lithium/tantalum operations is unreported and small. [Geoscience Australia+1](https://www.ga.gov.au/aimr2024/australias-identified-mineral-resources?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **European Union/UK/Norway/Iceland/Japan:** **No mine production.** (Japan and the EU are major **consumers** and **importers**; Japan also has Nb metal/alloy manufacturing but no domestic ore.) Global mine production in 2024 was **\~110,000 t Nb**, almost **91%** from Brazil, \~6‚Äì7% from Canada; China‚Äôs mine output is minor compared with Brazil.

**Bottom line:** among the U.S. and close allies, **Canada (Niobec) is the only current primary producer** at \~7.1 kt Nb/year; the U.S., EU, Japan and Australia have **zero** primary niobium mine output today.

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Demand 2030 (tons Nb content)**

**Measured baselines (most recent hard numbers):**

* **United States:** U.S. apparent consumption **\~8,400 t** (2024). Imports for consumption were **\~8,900 t** (Nb content), with 100% net import reliance.

* **European Union:** **FeNb imports 22,064,800 kg (2022)**. At a typical FeNb grade \~65% Nb, that is **\~14,300 t Nb**.

* **Japan:** **FeNb imports 6,003,700 kg (2022)** ‚Üí **\~3,900 t Nb** (65% basis).

**Uses mix:** Niobium demand is dominated by **micro‚Äëalloyed steels** (HSLA) for automotive, pipelines and construction; smaller shares go to superalloys, superconductors (Nb‚ÄëTi/Nb3Sn) and chemical applications.

**Reasonable 2030 planning range:** If allied consumption grows modestly with steel output (‚âà2‚Äì4%/yr) and higher‚Äëvalue uses (e.g., aerospace, some battery/anode R\&D) add incremental pull, a **U.S.+EU+Japan** demand range of **\~30,000‚Äì40,000 t Nb/year by \~2030** is defensible (from a measured \~26‚Äì27 kt combined baseline today). This is a range, not a single point forecast, and hinges mainly on steel volumes (not EV magnets).

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Supply 2030 (tons Nb content)**

* **Canada (Niobec):** Expect **continuation near \~7,000 t Nb/yr** absent a published expansion decision. (USGS shows 6,700 t in 2023; 7,100 t in 2024.)

* **United States (Elk Creek, Nebraska):** **NioCorp**‚Äôs 2022 feasibility study targets **\~7,450 t/yr ferroniobium** (FeNb) once operating (‚âà**\~4,800 t/yr Nb** at 65% Nb). The project has permits and has secured offtakes for much of planned FeNb, but financing and build schedules remain the gating items; 2030 production is **possible but not assured**. [Minedocs](https://minedocs.com/22/Elk_Creek-FS-06282022.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Australia (ASM Dubbo):** Polymetallic REE‚ÄìZr‚ÄìHf‚ÄìNb project with approvals; company materials indicate potential **niobium oxide** among products, but the 2025 heap‚Äëleach scoping re‚Äëphases toward REE first. **Commercial Nb volumes and timing remain uncommitted**; pre‚Äë2030 output is uncertain. [Australian Strategic Materials Ltd (ASM)+1](https://asm-au.com/mines/the-dubbo-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Europe/Japan:** No primary Nb mines. Processing capacity exists to alloy/import FeNb, but **no mine‚Äëderived Nb**.

**Supply outlook (allies):** A **base case** of **\~7 kt (Canada only)**, and an **optimistic case** of **\~10‚Äì12 kt** if Elk Creek (U.S.) enters production before/around 2030 and early Nb from Dubbo materializes. Either way, allied mine‚Äëbased supply remains **well short** of allied demand (‚âà30‚Äì40 kt). Imports‚Äîprimarily **FeNb from Brazil**‚Äîremain indispensable.

## **Key Bottleneck Technology for US & Allies**

**Where the real constraint is:** **Upstream primary supply** within allied borders, not basic metallurgy. With **\~91% of world mine output in Brazil** and **\~6‚Äì7% in Canada**, the U.S., EU, Japan and Australia lack domestic ore. Building a mine+concentrator is the hurdle; ferroniobium smelting is mature and concentrated at a few large plants (e.g., CBMM). Even by 2030, unless **Elk Creek** and at least one other allied project commission, allied mine‚Äëbased supply will likely remain ‚â§**\~10‚Äì12 kt Nb/yr** vs demand of \~30‚Äì40 kt.

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Niobium‚Äôs choke point for the U.S. and close allies is **primary production**: there are **no** operating mines outside Canada within the bloc, and only one (Niobec) today. World supply is overwhelmingly concentrated in Brazil; Canada contributes a small single‚Äëdigit percent. Unless new allied mines (notably Elk Creek) finance and build by decade‚Äôs end, the **supply gap** persists and imports (mainly Brazilian FeNb) remain essential.

### **Quick corrections to your draft (for clarity)**

* Canada‚Äôs current production is **\~7.1 kt Nb (2024)** (not a generic 7‚Äì9 kt range without source); Canada is **\~6‚Äì7%** of world output, not 8‚Äì10% in the latest USGS data.

* Demand drivers are **HSLA steel first**; EVs matter indirectly via vehicle steel demand‚Äîniobium is not a mainstream EV battery cathode material today (small R\&D niches exist).

* FeNb import figures for EU/Japan are best anchored to **WITS**; I‚Äôve converted to Nb content at 65% to avoid over‚Äëcounting.

Ytterbium is a heavy REE and occurs only in **trace** amounts in this ore, and the U.S. does **not** report any separated Yb production today. MP‚Äôs ‚ÄúUpstream 60K‚Äù program is an on‚Äësite mining/separation expansion toward \~60 kt/y of rare‚Äëearth **products**, focused on NdPr and other LREEs; it does not imply material Yb output. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136823001439?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Australia.**  
   Australia‚Äôs 2024 mine production was **\~13,000 t REO** (USGS estimate). Lynas remains the largest non‚ÄëChina producer; it is expanding cracking/leach and separation, and adding **heavy‚ÄëREE separation (Dy/Tb)** capability (Malaysia; U.S. DPA‚Äëbacked work in Texas), but Yb is not a target product and any Yb in Mt Weld feed is **very small**. Iluka‚Äôs **Eneabba Rare Earths Refinery** (WA) is due to start up **around 2027** with **heavy‚ÄëREE** capability, improving allied HREE processing generally.

* **Canada.**  
   No operating rare‚Äëearth mine at present; **Canada‚Äôs 2024 REO mine production is 0** in USGS reporting. (Processing pilots exist, but they rely on imported concentrates.)

* **European Union / UK / Norway / Iceland.**  
   No commercial REE mining yet; Europe is building separation capacity (e.g., Iluka‚Äôs Eneabba in Australia feeding allied markets; Solvay La Rochelle continues specialty separation in France), but **no EU mine** contributes Yb today.

* **Japan.**  
   No domestic mining. Japan is piloting **deep‚Äësea REE mud** test mining near Minami‚ÄëTorishima in **fiscal 2026**, but this has not yet translated into terrestrial Yb supply.

**Takeaway:** Allied *mine* output exists (U.S., Australia), but **Yb‚Äëspecific production is essentially nil** today in the alliance because current orebodies are LREE‚Äërich (bastn√§site) and heavy‚ÄëREE separation circuits focus on Dy/Tb rather than Yb. Yb is geologically concentrated in **xenotime** and other HREE minerals, not in Mountain Pass bastn√§site.

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Demand 2030 (tons)**

* **Primary uses.** Ytterbium is a key **laser dopant** (e.g., Yb‚Äëdoped fiber lasers; Yb:YAG/thin‚Äëdisk lasers) for industrial cutting/welding, medical, and defense systems; it also appears in certain glasses, scintillators, and niche alloys. These applications are growing with industrial laser adoption. [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/laser/Fundamental-principles?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[Optica Publishing Group](https://opg.optica.org/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-29-10-15724&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Quantification is sparse.** Neither USGS nor EU public statistics break out Yb tonnages. Given:  
   (i) Yb is a **minor** lanthanide by volume;  
   (ii) Yb loadings in laser media are **small** (gram‚Äëlevel per kW‚Äëclass device); and  
   (iii) laser markets are growing mid‚Äësingle to low‚Äëdouble digits,  
   a **planning band** for **allied 2030 demand** is likely **on the order of a few‚Äëtens of tonnes per year of Yb oxide equivalent**, not hundreds. This is consistent with Yb‚Äôs role (high value, low mass) relative to bulk magnet REEs. *(Caveat: precise public forecasts do not exist; this band reflects the scale of laser/media usage and current market structure.)* [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/laser/Fundamental-principles?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **U.S.:** MP‚Äôs **Upstream 60K** expansion increases overall RE product throughput, but is **NdPr‚Äëcentric**; there is **no announced Yb product line**. [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169136823001439?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  * **Australia:** Lynas‚Äôs added **heavy‚ÄëREE separation** (Malaysia) is slated to process **\~1,500 t/y of heavy‚Äëoxide feed** (Dy/Tb focus) by mid‚Äëdecade. **Iluka Eneabba** is scheduled to come online **\~2027** with heavy‚ÄëREE separation (HREO capability and initial REO capacity **\~23 kt/y**), enabling *some* recovery of the full HREE suite from suitable feeds.

  * **Japan/EU/Canada:** No new mines expected to contribute meaningful Yb by 2030; separation capacity may **toll** imported mixed concentrates.

* **Implication.** Even with these projects, **separated Yb output in allied jurisdictions will likely remain very small (order: low‚Äëtens of tonnes per year at most)**, because feedstocks are LREE‚Äëdominant and commercial circuits prioritize Dy/Tb. The bulk of Yb oxide is expected to remain **import‚Äësourced** unless dedicated xenotime/HREE deposits are developed and processed in‚Äëbloc.

* **Water treatment / zero‚Äëdischarge:** Lime neutralization, ion‚Äëexchange polishing, and high recovery water circuits are standard to control radionuclides and dissolved metals from REE processing.

---

## **Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies ‚Äî Yb**

* **Heavy‚ÄëREE separation capacity and feedstock mix.** Allied mines today are **LREE‚Äëweighted** (e.g., Mountain Pass bastn√§site). Commercial expansions (Lynas, Iluka) emphasize Dy/Tb; **Yb is not an economic focus** and remains a **late‚Äëstage, low‚Äëconcentration** product in SX trains. Without **xenotime‚Äërich feed** and **dedicated HREE circuits**, allied Yb volumes stay very small.

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

The limiting step is **not mining tonnage but chemistry and feed mix**: allied operations process mostly **LREE** ore, and the **heavy‚ÄëREE separation** capacity being built prioritizes Dy/Tb, not Yb. Because **Yb content is minute** in current allied feeds and Yb would emerge only very late in complex SX trains, separated Yb oxide production in the U.S./allies will likely remain **low‚Äëtens of tonnes per year (at best) by 2030** unless xenotime/HREE deposits are brought online and fully separated domestically.

---

### **Notes on a few statements you may have seen elsewhere**

* Mountain Pass ore is **bastn√§site**, not monazite/xenotime; **Yb is negligible** there. Yb commonly resides in **xenotime** (YPO‚ÇÑ) and other HREE minerals. [U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3078/pdf/fs2014-3078.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* ‚ÄúYb ‚âà0.03% in monazite‚Äù is a reasonable order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude for *monazite* (not xenotime) and underscores why Yb is scarce in LREE‚Äërich bastn√§site systems.

# Hafnium

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Current Production (t/yr)**

* **France (EU).** France is presently the single largest allied producer. Industry reporting indicates France‚Äôs producer (Orano/Framatome) is making **\~30‚ÄØt Hf/yr** today and plans to **lift capacity to \~45‚ÄØt/yr** on the near‚Äëterm timeline as its zirconium/hafnium separation capacity is expanded. That scale implies **\~40‚Äì45% of current world Hf output** (global supply is still on the order of **70‚Äì75‚ÄØt/yr**). [CRM Alliance](https://www.crmalliance.eu/hafnium?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **United States.** There is **no mining** of hafnium; Hf is recovered when U.S. firms purify imported zirconium intermediates (the Zr industry must remove Hf for nuclear‚Äëgrade Zr). The **USGS (2025)** notes **one producer in Oregon and one in Utah** make zirconium **and hafnium** metal from Zr chemical feed. U.S. *unwrought hafnium* imports were **\~50‚ÄØt in 2024** (exports \~10‚ÄØt), underscoring dependence on foreign feed even though domestic metalmaking exists. Top 2024 import sources were **Germany (50%)**, **China (21%)**, **France (18%)**. [U.S. Geological Survey](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-zirconium-hafnium.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## **Key Bottleneck Technology for US & Allies**

* **Zr‚ÄìHf separation capacity (chemistry \+ plant).** The **principal choke point** is not ore, but **industrial separation** of Hf from Zr ‚Äî a **multi‚Äëstage, capital‚Äëintensive** SX or chloride‚Äëdistillation operation run by a **very small number of producers**. Recent market analysis highlights that the **limited producer base and separation bottleneck** are already constraining supply; even in the U.S., expansions hinge on feed availability and capex. Trade frictions (e.g., **U.S. tariffs near 80% on Chinese Hf**, **\~20% on French material**) further stress supply optionality.

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Hafnium supply is governed by **where zirconium is purified**, not where zircon is mined. Outside China/Russia, only a handful of allied facilities can economically **separate and refine Hf**, and those circuits are expensive to build and scale. With demand led by semiconductors and aerospace rising toward **\~180‚ÄØt/yr globally by 2030**, allied capacity expansions (France to \~45‚ÄØt; potential U.S. adds) help but **do not eliminate the constraint** unless additional separation trains are built and fed.

# Aluminum

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Current Production (tons)**

* **United States.**  
   Primary aluminum production was **\~670,000 t in 2024** (down 11% y/y). Installed year‚Äëend primary capacity was **\~1.36 Mt**. Secondary recovery from scrap was **\~3.6 Mt** in 2024 (‚âà2.0 Mt from new scrap, 1.6 Mt from old scrap). Net import reliance for primary aluminum was **\~47% of apparent consumption** in 2024 (not \~85%).

* **Canada.**  
   Canada produced **\~3.2‚Äì3.3 Mt** of primary aluminum in 2023 and is consistently a top‚Äë5 global producer owing to hydro‚Äëpowered smelters in Qu√©bec and British Columbia.

* **Australia.**  
   Australia‚Äôs four coastal smelters (Tomago, Boyne Island, Bell Bay, Portland) produced **\~1.6 Mt** in 2024\.

* **European Union (EU‚Äë27 & UK).**  
   Primary production in the **EU‚Äë27** was **\~1.92 Mt in 2022** (latest consolidated figure); Western & Central Europe (EU‚Äë27+UK, excl. Russia) produced **\~2.71 Mt in 2023** amid continuing power‚Äëprice pressure.

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)**

Independent IAI/CRU modeling expects **strong regional demand growth by 2030**, driven by transport electrification, grid expansion, renewables, construction, and packaging:

* **North America:** **\+5.1 Mt** vs. 2020 baseline by 2030\.

* **Europe:** **\+4.8 Mt** vs. 2020 baseline by 2030\.

* **Rest of Asia ex‚ÄëChina (incl. Japan):** **\+8.6 Mt** vs. 2020 baseline by 2030\.

These are **incremental** tons (not totals) and imply that allied demand will be in the **mid‚Äëteens of Mt/y** in each of North America and Europe by 2030, even with rising recycling rates.

## **US and Allies ‚Äî Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)**

* **United States (primary).**  
   The base is \~0.67 Mt (2024). Emirates Global Aluminium has **announced a new U.S. primary smelter (Oklahoma)**, capacity **600‚Äì700 kt/y**, targeted for **start‚Äëup in 2029** (subject to permitting, power and feedstock). If realized, U.S. primary output could approach **\~1.3‚Äì1.4 Mt/y** by 2030 before accounting for any restarts. **Note:** Alumina feed will be imported unless new domestic refinery capacity is built.

* **United States (secondary).**  
   Secondary production from purchased scrap was \~3.6 Mt in 2024; sustained scrap flows and capacity expansions suggest **U.S. secondary supply remains the largest domestic source of metal** into 2030\.

* **Canada.**  
   Hydro‚Äëpowered smelters remain a cornerstone. Rio Tinto is adding **\~160 kt/y** at the AP60 Saguenay Complex (Quebec) by **2026**, bringing Canada closer to **\~3.4‚Äì3.5 Mt/y** by 2030 (assuming stable power). [RMI](https://rmi.org/delivering-a-net-zero-future-for-aluminum/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Australia.**  
   Absent new builds, production likely **\~1.5‚Äì1.6 Mt/y** by 2030, contingent on power price and grid decarbonization.

* **Europe, Norway, Iceland.**  
   Western & Central Europe primary output fell to **\~2.7 Mt (2023)** and remains constrained by energy costs; **Norway (\~1.3 Mt)** and **Iceland (\~0.8‚Äì0.9 Mt)** provide the bulk of low‚Äëcarbon European‚Äëarea primary metal (hydro power).

## **Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production**

* **Power‚Äë and carbon‚Äëintensive smelting.** Primary Al still relies on **Hall‚ÄìH√©roult with carbon anodes**; absent widespread **inert‚Äëanode** deployment and very low‚Äëcost clean power, allied expansions face cost/CO‚ÇÇ headwinds. The IEA notes electricity dominates smelter costs and decarbonization needs breakthroughs (inert anodes, CCS). [ELYSIS](https://elysis.com/en/rio-tinto-and-alcoa-announce-worlds-first-carbon-free-aluminium-smelting-process?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Alumina feedstock & regional refining gaps.** The U.S. lacks domestic bauxite/alumina refining capacity; even a new U.S. smelter would **import alumina**, adding supply‚Äëchain risk.

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Aluminum‚Äôs chokepoint is **smelting technology plus power**, not geology. The allied bloc‚Äôs ability to add low‚Äëcarbon primary capacity is constrained by the **Hall‚ÄìH√©roult energy/CO‚ÇÇ penalty** and the lack of **inert‚Äëanode** systems at commercial scale; cheap, firm, low‚Äëcarbon electricity is also essential. At the same time, gaps in **alumina refining** (notably in the U.S.) mean even new smelters depend on imported feed. Until these mid‚Äëstream constraints are addressed, allies will meet demand growth primarily through **recycling** and **imports**, with selective primary additions (e.g., Canada, Norway/Iceland, the planned U.S. smelter).

* **EGA project:** credible plan for a **600‚Äì700 kt/y** Oklahoma smelter with **2029** start‚Äëup target.

# Thulium

## **US and Allies Domestic Current Production (tons)**

* **United States.** One operating REE mine (MP Materials, Mountain Pass, CA) produces LREE‚Äërich bastn√§site concentrates; heavy REEs (including Tm) are **negligible** in this ore and there is **no separated Tm** produced domestically today. U.S. rare‚Äëearth mine output was \~43‚ÄØkt REO in 2023, but this is almost entirely LREEs (Ce‚ÄìNd), with Tm only in trace amounts in the deposit.  
   *Context:* U.S. midstream efforts are progressing‚ÄîEnergy Fuels commissioned on‚Äëspec NdPr oxide in 2024 and plans initial Dy/Tb output in 2025‚Äîbut these lines target magnet REEs first; any Tm would be a minute tail fraction much later in the separation train.

* **Australia.** Lynas (Mt Weld) is the leading allied miner/processor. In 2025 it reported the **first separated Dy and Tb outside China**, a step toward broader HREE capability; however, Tm remains an **ultra‚Äëminor** constituent in Mt Weld flows and is not a declared product stream. Iluka‚Äôs Eneabba HREE refinery (WA) is ramping mid‚Äëdecade, likewise focused on Dy/Tb first. Net: **no material separated Tm tonnage** published from Australia.

* **Canada.** No sustained REE mine producing Tm today (Vital‚Äôs Nechalacho pilot ceased; Canada‚Äôs SRC is a processor). **Tm output \~0.** (General production status from public agencies/press; no Tm line.)

* **Europe (EU/UK/Norway/Iceland).** No operating REE mines. Some separation capability exists (e.g., Solvay/Neo for selected RE streams), but **no published separated Tm output**; Europe relies on imports for HREEs.

* **Japan.** No domestic REE mining; uses imported RE products. **No primary Tm production.** (Japan and allied Asia are net importers of HREEs.)

**Global context:** Multiple reputable references put **world Tm oxide production at \~50‚ÄØt/yr**, underscoring how small this market is. Allied share of that is currently **near zero** because separated Tm streams are largely produced in China. [dggs.alaska.gov](https://dggs.alaska.gov/pubs/id/30821?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## **US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)**

* **Use profile (Tm‚Äôs niche):** Tm is used mainly in **lasers** (Tm‚Äëdoped fiber/YAG at \~2‚ÄØ¬µm for medical and industrial uses), select **photonics/glass**, and **radioisotope sources** (legacy portable X‚Äëray; niche). These are small but technologically strategic markets. (General technical use notes; see also China demand modelling below.)

* **Order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude demand.** Hard measured, public, ex‚ÄëChina Tm demand time series are scarce. Two anchors:

  1. **Supply‚Äëside:** global Tm oxide output is widely cited as **\~50‚ÄØt/yr**, implying similar global consumption today. [dggs.alaska.gov](https://dggs.alaska.gov/pubs/id/30821?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

  2. **China model:** a peer‚Äëreviewed input‚Äìoutput study estimates **China‚Äôs final demand** for Tm reached **\~208‚ÄØt in 2020**, highlighting uncertainty and potential unreported/stock changes; it also flags Tm‚Äôs steep price volatility. (Note: this is an economic model, not a shipment tally.)

* **Planning range for allies (2030).** Given (i) very small present supply, (ii) continued growth of **fiber‚Äëlaser** markets (\~mid‚Äësingle‚Äëdigit CAGR into the 2030s), and (iii) allied onshoring of critical photonics/medical manufacturing, a **reasonable planning bracket** for **US+EU+JP+CA+AU** is **\~50‚Äì120‚ÄØt/yr (Tm oxide equivalent) by 2030**. The low end aligns with today‚Äôs global physical supply; the high end reflects upside if Tm‚Äëlaser adoption and allied reshoring outpace today‚Äôs baseline. (Laser demand growth benchmark.)

*What it means:* Tm remains a **tiny‚Äëtonnage**, high‚Äëvalue input. Even modest programmatic buys (defense/medical) can move the market.

---

## **US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)**

* **United States.** Mountain Pass is LREE; **no mine‚Äëgate Tm.** Energy Fuels (UT) brought NdPr online in 2024 and plans Dy/Tb output in 2025 from monazite feeds; eventually the **late‚ÄëHREE fraction (Er‚ÄìLu, incl. Tm)** could be produced in kilogram‚Äë to small‚Äëtonnage quantities, but no Tm volumes are published. **Indicative 2030 U.S. Tm: \< a few t/yr**, unless a dedicated late‚ÄëHREE circuit is stood up.

* **Australia.** Lynas now separates Dy/Tb (2025); Iluka‚Äôs Eneabba HREE refinery is scheduled mid‚Äëdecade. Both could **produce small Tm cuts** as part of full HREE trains later, but near‚Äëterm product slates emphasize Dy/Tb. **Indicative 2030 AU Tm: single‚Äëdigit t/yr** (if any), contingent on refining scope.

* **Europe & Japan.** No mining; limited HREE separation. Separated Tm by 2030 would be **trace‚Äëlevel** unless new feedstocks and dedicated late‚ÄëHREE circuits are financed.

* **Allied total (2030).** Summing realistic paths (U.S. heavy‚ÄëREE lines maturing; AU HREE refineries online; minor EU/Japan tolling), **separated allied Tm is likely only in the low‚Äësingle‚Äë to low‚Äëdouble‚Äëdigit t/yr range** by 2030 (best case perhaps **\~10‚Äì20‚ÄØt/yr**). The balance of allied demand would remain **import‚Äëreliant**.

*Note on uncertainty:* Tm statistics are sparse; many sources repeat legacy estimates. Where ranges are given above, they reflect that uncertainty.

---

## **Key Discovery Technologies**

* **Radiometrics for placer indicators.** Monazite/xenotime placers associated with Th/U can be highlighted via airborne gamma surveys (Th‚Äëchannel anomalies), a classic approach for heavy‚Äëmineral sands in the SE U.S. and elsewhere.

* **Deposit models & mapping.** Carbonatite and peralkaline intrusive systems (and their weathered regoliths) remain the primary hard‚Äërock REE targets; USGS models guide mapping and sampling programs that can vector toward HREE‚Äëbearing xenotime.

* **Geophysical & geochemical screening.** High‚Äëresolution magnetics/gravity to outline intrusions; stream‚Äësediment/soil ICP‚ÄëMS (tracking Y‚ÄìYb anomalies as xenotime proxies) to narrow drill targets. (General method per USGS models.)

---

## **Key Extraction Technologies**

* **Mining & beneficiation.** Dredge/open‚Äëpit of heavy‚Äëmineral sands; spirals and magnetic/electrostatic separators to make zircon/ilmenite/monazite/xenotime concentrates (where Tm resides).

* **‚ÄúCracking‚Äù & leaching.** Acid cracking (H‚ÇÇSO‚ÇÑ/HCl) of monazite/xenotime to dissolve REEs into chloride/sulfate liquor for separation‚Äîflowsheets used commercially (e.g., Lynas LAMP; Energy Fuels for monazite feeds).

---

## **Key Separation Technologies**

* **Solvent extraction (SX) cascades.** The workhorse for splitting lanthanides; hundreds of mixer‚Äësettler stages with organophosphorus extractants (e.g., D2EHPA, Cyanex‚Äëtype). HREE cuts (Dy/Tb first priority) come before late‚ÄëHREE polishing (Er‚ÄìTm‚ÄìYb‚ÄìLu).

* **Advanced membranes/IX (pilot).** Supported liquid membranes (D2EHPA) and chelating resins can sharpen heavy‚Äëlanthanide separation and reduce organic use, but remain pilot‚Äëscale for industrial Tm. (General technology line‚Äîsee research literature summarized alongside SX.)

---

## **Key Purification & Refinement Technologies**

* **Metallothermic reduction & vacuum purification.** Standard route is chlorination of purified Tm oxide to TmCl‚ÇÉ, followed by **calciothermic reduction** (or related metallothermic steps) to metal; **vacuum distillation**/remelting removes residuals. These unit operations are well‚Äëestablished for lanthanides.

* **Molten‚Äësalt electrolysis (R\&D/limited).** Direct reduction of Tm halides in LiCl‚ÄìKCl or CaCl‚ÇÇ melts is feasible and used for some REEs; industrial Tm metal output is tiny, so this remains specialty practice.

---

## **Key Remediation Technologies**

* **Mineral‚Äësands tailings management.** Monazite contains Th; standard practice is controlled handling, possible REE recovery, and safe return/encapsulation of residual radioactive fractions; extensive **water recycle** in dredge operations.

* **Closed‚Äëloop hydromet.** Neutralization and metals precipitation, with recovery of REEs from process waters (IX or precipitation), reduce discharge and can recapture trace HREEs like Tm. (Industry‚Äëstandard hydromet practice as referenced across separation literature.)

---

## **Key Bottleneck technology for US and Allies Domestic Production**

* **Late‚ÄëHREE separation capacity.** The limiting factor is **midstream separation**‚Äîspecifically, the scarcity (outside China) of full‚Äëchain SX trains that run past Dy/Tb to **Er‚ÄìTm‚ÄìYb‚ÄìLu** in meaningful volumes. Lynas‚Äô Dy/Tb milestone is important but does **not** yet translate into material Tm tonnage; U.S. builds (e.g., Energy Fuels) are prioritizing NdPr and early HREEs. Until allied operators finance and operate late‚ÄëHREE circuits continuously, separated Tm supply onshore will remain **single‚Äëdigit tonnes** at best.

### **Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Thulium is rare in most allied feedstocks and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîsits at the **very end of the separation train**, where allied capacity is thinnest. While Australia and the U.S. are now proving Dy/Tb separation, **industrial‚Äëscale Er‚ÄìTm‚ÄìYb‚ÄìLu** circuits are still largely absent outside China. As a result, even if allied mines and mixed concentrates grow, **onshore Tm** will stay limited without dedicated late‚ÄëHREE SX capacity. Near‚Äëterm planning should assume **continued import reliance** for Tm through 2030\.

---

### **Quick takeaways**

* **Today:** Allied **separated Tm ‚âà 0‚Äìfew t/yr**; world production is only **\~50‚ÄØt/yr**. [dggs.alaska.gov](https://dggs.alaska.gov/pubs/id/30821?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **2030 demand (allies):** **\~50‚Äì120‚ÄØt/yr (Tm‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ‚Äëeq)**, dominated by lasers/medical/photonics; uncertainty is high given sparse public data.

* **2030 supply (allies):** **\~10‚Äì20‚ÄØt/yr** in a best‚Äëcase where AU/US late‚ÄëHREE circuits mature; otherwise **single‚Äëdigit t/yr**. Imports fill the gap.

* **Main driver: NdFeB magnets.** Nd demand is dominated by Nd‚ÄëFe‚ÄëB permanent magnets for **EV traction motors**, **industrial motors** and **wind turbines**. Policy and OEM guidance point to robust growth in the 2020s. Adamas Intelligence projects **magnet‚ÄëREE demand growth (\~7.1% CAGR)** outpacing supply (\~5.1%), with a **\~19,000‚Äët NdPr oxide global deficit by 2030** if new capacity lags. [MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-wont-keep-with-demand-by-2040-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Wind power intensity.** Direct‚Äëdrive and hybrid wind turbines use substantial NdFeB mass‚Äî**\~80‚Äì700 kg NdFeB per MW depending on design**‚Äîwith offshore units at the high end. Planned US/EU offshore buildouts imply steady allied Nd pull through 2030\.

**Planning range:** Rolling up EVs, wind, and other electrification uses, a **US+allies** requirement on the order of **\~10,000‚Äì15,000 t/yr of NdPr oxide by 2030** is a defensible range (i.e., a large fraction of forecast global needs), consistent with the magnet deficit outlook above.

## **US and Allies Domestic Supply 2030 (tons)**

* **MP Materials (USA).** MP has ramped NdPr oxide production (2024: **\~1.3 kt**) and is integrating **US metal and magnet making in Texas**. A recent SEC filing details a planned **US 10,000‚Äët/yr sintered NdFeB magnet facility** (the ‚Äú10X Facility,‚Äù commissioning targeted in **2028**) and a **10‚Äëyear US NdPr price floor of $110/kg** intended to underpin upstream investment. These moves position MP to lift **US Nd/Pr availability materially by 2030** (several kt/yr, contingent on ore, separation, and metal lines).

* **Other allied projects.** Additional Nd units could come from Arafura (Nolans), Hastings (Yangibana), and US/EU separation lines now under construction, but most are not yet at commercial scale.

**Summation:** Realistically, by **2030** the allied bloc could be producing **\~10‚Äì15 kt/yr of NdPr oxide** (Lynas \~10 kt \+ MP several kt \+ smaller additions) ‚Äî **still short** of allied demand growth trajectories, keeping imports part of the mix.

### **Key Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Allied ore supply exists, but converting concentrates into **separated Nd/Pr oxide** and then into **metal/magnets** remains the rate‚Äëlimiter. Even with MP/Lynas expansions, **processing/magnet capacity** must scale faster than mine output to close the projected **NdPr shortfall by 2030**. Build‚Äëout of SX, metal reduction and sintered magnet lines‚Äîplus recycling‚Äîwill determine how much of allied demand can be met domestically.

## **US and Allies Domestic Demand 2030 (tons)**

* **Use profile.** In the U.S. (a good proxy for allied usage), 2024 end‚Äëuses were **\~39% flame retardants**, **\~40% metal products** (chiefly antimonial lead for batteries & ammunition), and **\~21% non‚Äëmetal products** (glass, catalysts, chemicals).

## **Key Discovery Technologies**

* **Geological mapping & geochemistry (Sb‚ÄëAu epithermal systems).** Field mapping of quartz‚Äìsulfide veins plus soil/stream‚Äësediment geochemistry for **Sb, As, Tl, Au** pathfinders remains the primary discovery workhorse in districts like Idaho‚Äôs Stibnite. [Invalid URL](https://chatgpt.com/)

* **Induced‚Äëpolarization (IP) & resistivity.** Sulfide‚Äërich stibnite veins create **high‚Äëchargeability** anomalies that help trace blind ore shoots beneath cover.

* **Hyperspectral/alteration mapping.** Kaolinite/sericite/iron oxide alteration halos around Sb veins can be mapped by multispectral/hyperspectral imagery to vector drilling.

* **Data integration.** Combining structural models with geochemistry/geophysics (ML‚Äëassisted targeting) shortens drill campaigns in mature terranes.

---

## **Key Extraction Technologies**

* **Mining.** Narrow, steep **stibnite (Sb‚ÇÇS‚ÇÉ)** veins are mined by underground methods (decline access, cut‚Äëand‚Äëfill or long‚Äëhole stoping). Bulk tonnage is rare; selective mining reduces dilution.

* **Physical beneficiation.** **Gravity** (jigs/tables) to pre‚Äëconcentrate dense stibnite, followed by **flotation** (xanthate/sulfide collectors) to concentrate Sb sulfide.

* **Roasting to oxide.** Fluidized‚Äëbed or multiple‚Äëhearth **oxidation roasting** converts Sb‚ÇÇS‚ÇÉ ‚Üí **Sb‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ** (antimony trioxide) and produces a saleable FR‚Äëgrade oxide or an intermediate for metal reduction; **SO‚ÇÇ** is captured in acid plants.

* **(Alt.) Pressure leach.** Autoclave **chloride/sulfate** leaching of fine concentrates can solubilize Sb (and co‚Äërecovered Au), enabling hydromet flows where smelting is constrained.

---

## **Key Separation Technologies**

* **Roast ‚Üí oxide route.** Controlled oxidation produces **Sb‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ** (FR feedstock).

* **Pyromet reduction to metal.** **Sb‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ \+ 3Fe ‚Üí 2Sb \+ 3FeO** (or using coke/Fe‚ÄìSi in shaft/electric furnaces) yields **antimony metal** typically 99‚Äì99.5%.

* **Electro‚Äërefining (select cases).** Chloride or alkaline electrolytes refine crude Sb to high purity; used where ultra‚Äëlow impurities are required.

* **Vacuum distillation/zone refining.** High‚Äëpurity Sb (99.95%+) via staged evaporation and re‚Äëcondensation; zone‚Äëmelting for semiconductor grades.

---

## **Key Purification & Refinement Technologies**

* **Hydro‚Äëpyro hybrids.** Pressure‚Äëleach to solution ‚Üí precipitation/solvent extraction ‚Üí calcine to **Sb‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ** ‚Üí pyromet reduction to metal.

* **Alloying & decanting.** Molten Sb‚ÄìPb alloys can be fractionated by controlled cooling; largely superseded by direct roast/reduction but still relevant in legacy circuits.

* **High‚Äëpurity finishing.** Multi‚Äëpass **vacuum distillation** or **zone refining** to semiconductor/battery grades.

---

## **Key Remediation Technologies**

* **AMD control & metals precipitation.** **Lime/alkali** neutralization precipitates Fe‚Äëoxyhydroxides that co‚Äësorb **Sb**; sludge is dewatered/contained.

* **Constructed wetlands.** Passive polishing of Sb‚Äëbearing drainage using iron‚Äërich substrates and microbial processes to immobilize antimonate/antimonite species.

* **Adsorptive polishing.** **Granular ferric hydroxide, modified biochar, mesoporous alumina** beds to capture dissolved Sb before discharge.

* **Tailings covers & revegetation.** Sulfide‚Äëbearing Sb tailings require water covers or engineered caps plus **phytostabilization** to curb erosion and dust.

### **Key Bottleneck summary (2‚Äì4 sentences)**

Allied antimony supply is constrained primarily by **processing capacity**, not ore. With no U.S./EU mine base and few Western **roast/reduction** complexes, concentrates depend on foreign smelters. China‚Äôs 2024 licensing and the **Dec‚Äë2024 ban on Sb exports to the U.S.** exposed that vulnerability, while export‚Äëcontrol on antimony smelting technology further complicates catch‚Äëup. Unless allies add integrated **roaster ‚Üí oxide ‚Üí metal** capacity, even marquee mines like Stibnite will not fully close the allied supply gap.

   **Where it comes from:** 2024 Canadian output is primarily from **North American Lithium (NAL)** in Qu√©bec (Sayona‚ÄìPiedmont JV) and the **Tanco** mine in Manitoba (Sinomine). **Whabouchi (Nemaska)** and **Moblan (Sayona/Ganfeng)** were under development, not producing in 2024\.

* **Verdict:** **Needs correction.**  
   The EU has **non‚Äëzero** mine output: **Portugal** produced **\~380 t Li content in 2024** (small, but not zero). In addition, **AMG Lithium** started Europe‚Äôs **first battery‚Äëgrade LiOH refinery** in Germany (20,000 t/y module), i.e., refining capacity exists in the EU even as mining remains limited.

## **2\) US & allies ‚Äì 2030 demand**

* **Your text:** ‚ÄúAlbemarle projects global demand \~3.3 Mt LCE by 2030‚Ä¶ US & allies at \~30‚Äì50% implies \~1‚Äì1.7 Mt LCE (\~190‚Äì320 kt Li) per year by 2030\. For example, reaching 50% EV market share in the US & EU would consume \~100‚Äì200 kt Li‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ annually.‚Äù

* **Verdict:** **Mixed.**  
   **Global 2030 demand at \~3.3 Mt LCE** from Albemarle is **correct** per **FT** coverage.  
   **The US/EU ‚Äúexample‚Äù (100‚Äì200 kt Li‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ at 50% EV share)** is **too low by several‚Äëfold.** A simple check: in **2023**, **battery demand for lithium** was already **\~140 kt Li (content)** globally (‚âà **745 kt LCE**), before any 50% EV share in US/EU. By 2030, if US and EU together sold \~14 million EVs/year (50% of \~28M light‚Äëvehicle sales), and each EV averaged \~30‚Äì40 kg **LCE** (‚âà60 kWh pack √ó \~0.5‚Äì0.6 kg LCE/kWh), that alone implies **\~420‚Äì560 kt LCE** just for new EVs in US+EU‚Äî**well above 100‚Äì200 kt LCE.** [IEA](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-ev-outlook-2024/trends-in-electric-vehicle-batteries?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344921003712?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What to change:** Keep Albemarle‚Äôs **3.3 Mt LCE (2030)**, but drop/replace the 100‚Äì200 kt LCE example. A defensible 2030 order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude for **US+EU combined** is **several hundred thousand tonnes LCE/yr** for EVs alone, plus grid storage.

## **3\) US & allies ‚Äì 2030 supply**

* **Your text:** ‚ÄúSumming announced projects suggests allied capacity on the order of 100‚Äì200 kt/yr LCE by 2030‚Ä¶‚Äù

* **Verdict:** **Incorrect if Australia is included as an ‚Äòally‚Äô.**  
   **Australia alone** produced **\~88 kt Li content in 2024** (‚âà**470 kt LCE**) and could be similar or larger by 2030, even after recent slowdowns. Therefore, an allied total of only **100‚Äì200 kt LCE** in 2030 is **off by an order of magnitude** if Australia is part of ‚ÄúUS & allies‚Äù as you define it elsewhere.

* **Thacker Pass specifics:**  
   **Your text says** Thacker Pass is ‚Äúdesigned (two‚Äëphase) to produce 60,000 t/yr Li‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ by 2026.‚Äù  
   **Verdict:** **Out of date / understated on capacity and too aggressive on timing.** Lithium Americas‚Äô **Jan 2025** corporate materials describe **Phase 1** at **40,000 t/y** Li‚ÇÇCO‚ÇÉ, with expansion potential ultimately to **160,000 t/y** over **five phases**; first production is shown on the project timeline **after 2027**. Also, **Thacker Pass is a claystone (sedimentary) project**, *not* a spodumene hard‚Äërock operation. [Q4 Capital](https://s203.q4cdn.com/835901927/files/doc_presentations/2025/01/Technical-Report-December-2024.pdf)

* **EU projects:** Keliber (Finland) is **under construction** with **hot commissioning targeted for 1H 2026** and nameplate **\~15,000 t/y LiOH** thereafter‚Äîi.e., not zero, but modest by 2030\. [Sibanye-Stillwater](https://www.sibanyestillwater.com/business/europe/keliber/lithium-project/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[MINING.COM](https://www.mining.com/cost-of-sibanye-lithium-project-in-finland-raises-17-to-880m?amp=1&utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**What to change:** If you want to assess a ‚ÄúUS \+ Canada \+ EU \+ Japan‚Äù 2030 supply (excluding Australia), then a **100‚Äì200 kt LCE** order‚Äëof‚Äëmagnitude could be **plausible** depending on which projects actually reach nameplate‚Äîand on price conditions‚Äîbut it‚Äôs **not** correct for ‚ÄúUS & allies‚Äù *including* Australia. Please make your grouping explicit.

## **4\) References for volumes**

* **Canadian lithium:** Use **USGS** rather than Statista; USGS lists **4,300 t Li content (2024)** (matches your number).

* **Global production:** USGS lists **240,000 t Li content in 2024 (ex‚ÄëUS)**; the **‚âà1.3 Mt LCE** conversion is reasonable.

* **2030 demand (3.3 Mt LCE):** Albemarle forecast via **Financial Times** is fine.

* **Thacker Pass capacity/timing:** Replace older PFS numbers with **2025** company disclosure (**40 kt/y Phase 1; path to 160 kt/y; first production post‚Äë2027**). [Q4 Capital](https://s203.q4cdn.com/835901927/files/doc_presentations/2025/01/Technical-Report-December-2024.pdf)

## **5\) Key discovery technologies (geophysics & mapping)**

* **MT/CSAMT for brines:** Reasonable; MT can image conductive brine systems in closed basins. (Case studies available from Abitibi Geophysics.) [ageophysics.com](https://www.ageophysics.com/en/useful-resources/case-studies-and-news?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Gravity for pegmatites:** **Revise the density statement.** Spodumene‚Äëbearing **pegmatites are typically *less dense*** than common **mafic** hosts (e.g., amphibolite), so they appear as **gravity lows**; gravity can still help where contrasts are favorable. Your sentence says ‚Äúoften higher density,‚Äù which is generally the opposite of what‚Äôs used in practice. [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362600400_Application_of_Microgravity_Survey_in_the_Exploration_of_Rare-metal_Bearing_Pegmatites_-_A_Case_Study_from_Marlagalla_Mandya_District_Karnataka?utm_source=chatgpt.com)[MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/12/1498?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Magnetics/UAV‚Äëmag:** Fair with caveats‚Äîpegmatites themselves are often weakly magnetic; magnetics help via **structure/host** contrasts rather than a strong intrinsic pegmatite signature. (GREENPEG & recent reviews discuss the limits.) [Lyell Collection](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/SP526-2021-189?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Geologic mapping/geochem; remote sensing:** Directionally fine.

## **6\) Key extraction technologies**

* **Hard‚Äërock (spodumene) mining:**

  * **Grades:** You wrote that operations ‚Äúmine \~6‚Äì7% Li‚ÇÇO ore.‚Äù That \~6% is **concentrate grade (SC6)**, **not ore**. Head grades at **Greenbushes** are commonly around **\~2% Li‚ÇÇO** with variability (recent CY23/CY24 feed grades 2.2% and 2.18% Li‚ÇÇO, respectively). Please fix.

  * **Thacker Pass misclassification:** You placed Thacker Pass under ‚Äúhard‚Äërock (spodumene)‚Äù and said it targets ‚Äúsimilar spodumene ore.‚Äù That is **incorrect**; Thacker Pass is a **claystone** deposit with a **sulfuric‚Äëacid leach** flowsheet and on‚Äësite **sulfuric acid plant(s)**.

* **Ion exchange / adsorption:** Fine; widely piloted (e.g., Lilac, Standard Lithium). [Standard Lithium Ltd.](https://www.standardlithium.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/186/smackover-lithium-successfully-completes-derisking-of-dle?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* **Solvent extraction:** Niche and challenging for Li‚Å∫; OK to keep with ‚Äúunder development‚Äù caveat.

* **Membranes & electrodialysis:**  
   Your claim that **bipolar‚Äëmembrane electrodialysis (BMED/EEDBM) converts LiCl to LiOH** is supported by peer‚Äëreviewed work; **commercial use remains limited**.

* **Fluence/MOF claim:**  
   **Needs correction.** Fluence (NIROBOX) supplies **RO/NF water systems** and blogs about lithium membranes, but the **‚Äú\>90% Li‚Å∫ selectivity MOF membrane‚Äù** is **not a Fluence technology claim**; that performance appears in **academic** literature, not Fluence product sheets.

* **Fluidized‚Äëbed Li‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ granulation / co‚Äëprecipitation / bio approaches:** These remain **early‚Äëstage**; cite peer‚Äëreviewed pilot studies where possible (I didn‚Äôt see your exact MDPI Li‚ÇÉPO‚ÇÑ paper, but the concept is plausible as research).

* **Site‚Äëspecific examples (e.g., epsomite at Thacker Pass):** The **Thacker Pass** flowsheet clearly features **sulfuric acid leach** and extensive **lime/soda ash** use; be careful not to over‚Äëspecify polishing/side reactions beyond what‚Äôs in the technical report summaries.

## **Bottom line on conclusions**

* **Core conclusion (supply shortfall without more refining/DLE):** Directionally **right**. Western **refining** capacity and **commercial‚Äëscale DLE** remain the weak links; multiple projects paused or staged (e.g., Albemarle SC refinery). **But** your numeric comparison badly **understates allied mine supply** if Australia is included and **understates US/EU demand** at a 50% EV share. Tightening those numbers strengthens, not weakens, your argument.
